of American Journalism, from 1840 to
1870. By <span class="smcap">Augustus Maverick</span>. Hartford,
Connecticut: A. S. Hale. 1870.</p>

<p class="p2">There is no country in the world which
so finely illustrates the diffusive spirit of
modern civilization as America; for, though
in other lands human nature seems to rise
to a greater height in individual instances,
and to stand out in more picturesque relief,
it is the nation which has excelled them
all in equalizing the rights, the enjoyments,
and the intelligence of man. Many circumstances
have contributed to this happy result.
America has been clogged by none of
the mischievous remains of feudal institutions,
and but little affected by those violations
of political economy, older than the
age of reason, which have checked the free
and natural development of European communities.
Its provisions for popular education
were from the first singularly wise,
liberal, and ample; there was no legislation
to restrict all civil and social advantages to
the members of a single religious sect; and
no taxes on knowledge or artificial monopolies
of any kind, to prevent the people from
having access to that full variety of opinions,
inquiries, and statements of fact, which is
necessary to intellectual advancement. Above
all, it was born old, with all the elements of
European civilization to start with, and
equipped with a complete literature, in
which it would seem almost impossible to
find place for any great genius, and with the
best English works placed within every man's
reach, at less than a tenth of their original
cost. Taking these things in connection
with the boundless material resources of the
country, it is not by any means difficult to
explain the magical rapidity of its advances
in wealth and population, the signal prosperity
it has already enjoyed, and the extraordinary
power and greatness to which it is
evidently destined.</p>

<p>The development of the press, like the improvement
of the means of civilization, is a
certain sign of the relative advancement of a
nation. We use the term civilization here
to signify not so much the development of
some elevated and delicate parts of human
nature, such as art, philosophy, or politeness,
as that of political liberty and social progress;
and in this sense the progress of the press
becomes historically the most constant and
faithful indication of the general progress of
a nation. The truth of this proposition becomes
evident, from the close connection
that exists between the press and the public,
from the action and reaction, the efflux and
reflux, from the true corporate unity which
brings into the press the life-blood of the
country. We depend upon the newspaper
for distributing knowledge, as well as creating
it; it is an instrument by which the
opinions and feelings of the people may be
guided and developed, as well as communicated
and ascertained. It is in fact an
essential element in the peculiar spirit and
tendency which characterizes our modern
civilization. Still we are far from holding
that it is a perfect instrument, or free
from very serious drawbacks. Eminent
men like Lamartine speak of it in terms of
extravagant eulogy, predicting that before
the century shall have run out journalism
will be the whole press, the whole human
thought, and that the only book possible
from day to day will be the newspaper; a
great English novelist speaks of it as a link
in the great chain of miracles which prove
our national greatness; and Bulwer Lytton
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
calls it the chronicle of civilization, the great
mental camera which throws a picture of the
whole world upon a single sheet of paper.
These somewhat rhetorical representations
are very common, but they are far from
exact or truthful. We suspect that the newspaper
tends in all countries to ignore, more
or less, all knowledge that will not render its
teaching popular; that its chief figures are
often the wicked, the worthless, and the shallow;
and that its pictures, though generally
faithful, are often false, distorted, and narrow.
De Tocqueville liked the liberty of the
press, rather from the evils it prevented, than
from the advantages it created; and Montalembert
represents Liberty as saying to the
Press, like the unhappy swain&mdash;'<i>Nec cum
te nec sine te vivere possum</i>.' John Stuart
Mill has two objects of hatred; Puritanism,
with its positive creed and aggressive zeal,
and the ascendancy of the middle classes,
through the newspaper press, with all their
mediocrity and bigotry. He has always protested,
in the interests of his great idol, individuality,
against 'the <i>r&eacute;gime</i> of public
opinion,' against the various 'usurpations
upon the liberty of private life,' against the
moral intolerance of society, carried on
through, the newspapers. Amidst these
various estimates of the press we are disposed
to take a middle course. It may sometimes
be wielded by unworthy hands, for
unworthy purposes; its liberty may run into
licence, and the rules of good taste and propriety
be violated; its policy on public questions
may be unscrupulous and unprincipled;
but we remember that modern progress
would have been impossible without it; that
the people are not its slaves, but its patrons
and critics; and we would lay no other restraint
upon it than the invisible fetters imposed
by the intelligence and good feeling
of its readers. Whether, then, we consider
the amount and quality of intellectual force
put forth in it, the character of mind acted
on by it, and the wide area over which it
operates, especially in England and America,
where it has the greatest expansion, we cannot
but regard it as a subject for sincere congratulation
that its influence has been exercised
so uniformly on the side of public
safety and public morals, that there has been
a gradual improvement of late years in the
moral tone of newspaper management, and
that it has succeeded in creating and fostering
a healthy and independent public opinion
on all the questions of the age.</p>

<p>The great development of the American
press has taken place during the last thirty
years, keeping pace exactly with the advancing
prosperity of the country. A large
number of new and powerful processes, as
well as influences of a more general kind,
were converging towards this result. The
education of the people, the progress of
legislation, the discoveries of science, the inventions
of art, conspired to make literature,
especially in the newspaper form, a prime
necessity of American life, and to place it
within every man's reach on easy terms; while
every improvement made in the art of communication
and travel still farther contributed to
its growth, and increased its utility. So it has
come to pass that America is the 'classic soil
of newspapers;' everybody is reading; every
class is writing; literature is permeating
everywhere; publicity is sought for every
interest and every order; no political party,
no religious sect, no theological school, no
literary or benevolent association, is without
its particular organ; there is a universality
of print; the soldiers fighting in Mexico or
in the Southern states are printing the
journal of their exploits on the battle-field;
the press is seizing on the whole public life
and upon so much of private life as through
social irregularity, or individual force of character,
or national taste, necessarily emerges
into publicity; fostering on the one hand
the worship of the almighty dollar, but establishing
a strong and wholesome counterpoise,
by stimulating that zeal for public education,
that enthusiastic spirit of philanthropy,
and that truly munificent liberality
by which the American people have been
always distinguished. As we have already
intimated, the modern development of the
press is just thirty years old. There was no
telegraph before 1843; no fast ocean-steamer
to carry news from the old world for some
years later; and no Associated Press to organize
the supply of intelligence. The first
American newspaper was printed at Boston,
in 1690, fifty years after the appearance of
the first English newspaper; in 1775 there
were only 34 newspapers; in 1800, 200; in
1830, 1,000; and the latest statistics give no
less than 5,244 as the total number of journals
published in the United States, of which
542 are daily, 4,425 are weekly, and 127 are
monthly.</p>

<p>Our common idea of the American newspaper
is that of a print published by a literary
Barnum, whose type, paper, talents, morality,
and taste are all equally wretched and
inferior; who is certain to give us flippancy
for wit, personality for principle, bombast
for eloquence, malignity without satire, and
news without truth or reliability; whose paper
is prolific of all kinds of sensational
headings; and who is obliged, in the service
of his advertising customers, to become enthusiastic
on the subject of hams, exuberant
in the praises of hardware, and highly imaginative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
in the matter of dry-goods. Perhaps
this representation might apply, with some
degree of correctness, to a portion of the
newspaper press, especially that published in
the country towns and villages; but we shall
immediately see that American literary enterprise,
especially in the great cities, is not
to be judged by such unworthy examples.
The work of Mr. Maverick, which appears at
the head of this article, supplies a large
amount of information concerning American
journalism, connecting its more recent development
with the name of Henry J. Raymond,
a well-known Republican politician, who
founded the <i>New York Times</i>, one of the most
respectable and powerful newspapers in the
States. We cannot say much for the book,
on literary grounds: it exhibits nearly all
the worst qualities of Transatlantic journalism
itself&mdash;flimsiness, personality, and haste;
but its information is very interesting and
acceptable to European readers. The facts
of Raymond's life may be supplied in a few
sentences. He was born in 1820, at Lima,
in the state of New York; he graduated at
the University of Vermont; he went to New
York city in 1840, and was introduced to
newspaper life by Horace Greeley; he passed
ten laborious years on the <i>Tribune</i>, and
the <i>Courier</i> and <i>Inquirer</i>; and in the year
1851 he may be justly said to have opened
a new era in American journalism, by establishing
the <i>Times</i>, a daily paper, which carried
temperance and dignity into political
discussion, banishing all personalities, and
maintaining a high critical and moral tone,
which was all but unknown before that period.
Like most American journalists, he
engaged actively in politics, becoming in
1849 a member of the New York Legislature,
and afterwards speaker of the House of
Representatives, and Lieutenant-Governor of
the State; and in 1864, member of Congress.
He was a sincere and upright politician, who
always staunchly opposed the slave party in
the United States, but lost popularity and
credit, by his exceedingly foolish and unfortunate
championship of President Johnson,
through all his remarkable freaks of obstinacy
and eccentricity. On returning home
from his office, on the night of the 18th
June, 1869, he dropped down in the hall of
his house, in a fit of apoplexy, and died five
hours afterwards, without recovering consciousness.
He was in his fiftieth year.
Henry Ward Beecher said, in the funeral
oration at his grave, that Raymond 'was a
man without hate, and, he might almost say,
without animosity; his whole career had
been free from bitterness;' and Horace
Greeley bore this high testimony to his professional
ability;&mdash;'I doubt whether this
country has known a journalist superior to
Henry J. Raymond. He was unquestionably
a very clever and versatile, but not powerful
writer; and excelled especially in newspaper
management.' We shall have occasion to
refer again to his services as a journalist.</p>

<p>In proposing to give some account of the
American press, both secular and religious,
we have to remark that the first great stimulus
given to newspaper enterprise in America
was by James Gordon Bennett, the
well-known editor of the <i>New York Herald</i>,
which was established in the year 1834.
This able journalist was born in 1800, at
Newmill, Keith, Banffshire, of Roman Catholic
parents. He was originally designed for
the priesthood, and had passed through a
portion of his preliminary training in the
Roman Catholic College of Blairs, near
Aberdeen, but ultimately abandoned the
prospects of a clerical life, and emigrated to
America, in his nineteenth year&mdash;as he said
himself&mdash;'to see the country where Franklin
was born.' There he formed an early
connection with the press, but it was not, as
we have said, till 1834 that he founded the
<i>Herald</i>. We are all more or less familiar
with the moral and intellectual characteristics
of this newspaper&mdash;unsparing personality,
intolerable egotism, and sleepless hatred
of England; but we are not so foolish as to
imagine that the <i>Herald</i> became popular
and successful because Americans are fond
of personal abuse, or private scandal, or of
the ceaseless denunciation of this country.
These offences against good taste and right
feeling existed long before the publication of
the <i>Herald</i>. The secret of its remarkable
success lay in the vigour and tact with which
Bennett laboured day and night to furnish
ample and early intelligence of events in all
parts of the world, without regard to cost
and labour. Mr. Maverick tells us that 'all
the old and heavy-weighted journals, which
lazily got themselves before the New York
public, day by day, thirty years ago, were
undeniably sleepy,' and that 'the ruthless
Bennett shocked the staid propriety of his
time by introducing the rivalries and the
spirit of enterprise which have ever since
been distinguishing characteristics of New
York newspaper life.' The <i>Herald</i> was
successful, then, because Bennett made it his
business to present his readers with fresh,
ample, and correct news. No editorial eloquence,
no skilful flattery of national prejudice
or party feeling, could have atoned for
any shortcoming in this respect. The other
newspaper managers were soon compelled
to imitate his energy and skill in the supply
of news, and Mr. Maverick has informed us
how effectively his example was sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
followed, by his rivals. On one occasion, before
the days of the telegraph, the leading
New York journals despatched reporters to
Boston, to obtain an early account of a
speech by Daniel Webster, who was then in
the plenitude of his fame. Two reporters
represented each journal; but Raymond
alone represented the <i>Tribune</i>. On their
return home by the steamer the other reporters
passed the night in convivial pleasantries;
but Raymond was busily engaged
all the time, in a retired part of the vessel,
writing off his report for a batch of printers
who were on board with their 'cases' of type;
so that the entire report, making several
columns of the <i>Tribune</i>, was prepared for
being printed on the arrival of the steamer
at New York, at five o'clock in the morning.
The feat was a remarkable instance of
newspaper enterprise. The Hudson River
steamboats afterwards regularly carried
corps of printers with types, from Albany to
New York, to prepare the speeches of legislators
for next morning's journals. Carrier-pigeons
were employed to convey the latest
European news from Halifax or Boston to
Wall-street; and pilot-boats made long voyages,
in stormy weather, to meet Atlantic
steamers in search of early news. In election
times pony-expresses were appointed
by rival journals to carry early intelligence
of results; as, in railway times, 'locomotive
engines were raced on rival lines of
railroad in the interest of papers which had
paid high prices for the right of way.' Sometimes
a little of that 'smartness,' which is so
popular in America, was displayed in these
newspaper rivalries, as when, on one occasion,
the <i>Tribune</i> reporter ran off to New
York on a special engine, hired expressly for
the <i>Herald</i>, and thus succeeded in publishing
an early and exclusive edition of some
important news.</p>

<p>The success of the <i>Herald</i> led Horace
Greeley to found the <i>Tribune</i>, in 1841. We
can see at once that, like Bennett and Raymond,
he was greatly endowed with that
species of sagacity which divines at a glance
the capabilities of a new project or speculation.
Greeley was the son of a New England
farmer, and came to New York a poor penniless
boy. His earlier essays in newspaper
management were total failures; but the
<i>Tribune</i> was remarkably successful from
its very commencement. It eschewed the
coarse and violent style of the <i>Herald</i>, and
pursued a far more generous and enlightened
policy on public questions, while it almost
rivalled the business-like energy of its earlier
contemporary; but it ultimately injured itself
by its championship of socialism, and a
host of other secular heresies. For, though
Greeley was of a remarkably practical
turn of mind, at least in the management of
his own business, he was a great theorist,
committed to every <i>recherch&eacute;</i> novelty in faith
and life, a moral philosopher, after a fashion
of his own, sincere and liberal in his ideas,
with deep sympathies for the working
classes, advocating their rights, and seeking
their elevation, while he did not fear to expose
their follies and their faults. The <i>Tribune</i>
became, under his management, the
organ of socialism and spirit-rapping, woman's
rights, vegetarianism, temperance, and
peace principles. It seemed, in fact, the
premature harbinger of the 'good time coming,'
adept in all the cant of reform, and familiar
with the whole philosophy of progress,
a very clear vein of sense being perceptible
to critical minds, in the elegant
sophistry with which it vindicated its own
course, and tried to overwhelm all objectors.
It attempted, in fact, to turn to account the
remarkable tremour of the public mind, which
arose from what was seen or said between
1845 and 1855 of mesmerism, electro-biology,
spirit-rapping, Swedenborgianism, and
psychology; but we are glad to know that
the <i>Tribune</i> has greatly improved in its
general views, and comes more into accord
with common ideas on these curious subjects.</p>

<p>It was the disgust and disappointment of
the public with the socialistic heresies of the
<i>Tribune</i>, as well as with the shameless and
indecent personalities of the <i>Herald</i>, that
led to the establishment of the <i>Times</i>, in
the year 1851. It took rank at once as a
dignified and able journal. Its influence was
exercised from the first on the side of morality,
industry, education, and religion; and
to use the words of an eminent English
journalist, now at the American press, 'it
encouraged truthfulness, carried decency,
temperance, and courtesy into discussion,
and helped to abate the greatest nuisance
of the age, the coarseness, violence, and calumny,
which does so much to drive sensible
and high-minded and competent men out
of public life, or keep them from entering
it.' No one, certainly, has ever done more
than Henry J. Raymond for the elevation of
the American newspaper. We cannot justly
overlook the substantial services done in the
same department by the <i>New York Evening
Post</i>, under the management of its
veteran editor, William Cullen Bryant, the
poet; by the <i>New York World</i>, a new
paper distinguished by the talent, incisiveness,
and dignity of its articles; and by the
<i>Nation</i>, managed by Mr. Godkin, an Irishman,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
once connected with the London press,
and which stands upon the intellectual level
of the best European periodicals.</p>

<p>We are indebted to Mr. Maverick for a
tolerably full account of the present position
of New York journalism. There are
150 newspapers published in that city, of
which 24 are daily papers, two of them
published in the French language, and three
in the German. The remainder are weekly
journals, of which eighteen are in German,
one in Italian, and two in Spanish. There
are no less than 258 German newspapers in
all America, the largest number being published
in Pennsylvania. There are eighteen
religious newspapers published in New York.
We have the following information in reference
to the literary and mechanical arrangements
of the daily press:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'Each of the great daily papers of New
York to-day employs more than a hundred
men, in different departments, and expends
half a million of dollars annually, with less
concern to the proprietors than an outlay of
one-quarter of that sum would have occasioned
in 1840. The editorial corps of the papers
issued in New York on the first day of the
present year numbered at least half a score of
persons; the reporters were in equal force;
sixty printers and eight or ten pressmen
were employed to put in type and to print the
contents of each issue of the paper; twenty
carriers conveyed the printed sheets to its
readers, and a dozen mailing clerks and bookkeepers
managed the business details of each
establishment. Editorial salaries now range
from twenty-five to sixty dollars a week; reporters
receive from twenty to thirty dollars a
week; and the gross receipts of a great daily
paper for a year often reach the sum of one
million of dollars, of which an average of one
third is clear profit. These statistics are applicable
to four or five of the daily morning
journals of New York.'</p>

<p>There is much literary ability displayed
in the daily and weekly journals of Washington,
Philadelphia, Boston, and other
leading cities. The <i>Boston Post</i> is a leading
paper in that city. It is answerable for all
the paradoxical absurdities of the famous
Mrs. Partington. The <i>Washington National
Era</i>, like the <i>National Intelligencer</i>, of
the same capital, has a high position, as a
literary and political journal. It was
through its columns that Mrs. Stowe first
gave to the world her 'Uncle Tom's Cabin,'
just as Judge Haliburton first published
'Sam Slick, the Clockmaker,' in the pages of
a Nova Scotian weekly newspaper.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact that the Americans
have never produced a Quarterly worthy
of the name, except the 'North American
Review,' which is certainly below the intellectual
level of the four or five English reviews
which are reprinted in New York
every quarter within a fortnight of their publication
in England. It was said, in explanation
of the fact that the French had never
succeeded in maintaining a review on the
plan of the English Quarterlies, that their
opinions and parties change so often, and
the nation was so volatile, that they could
not wait a quarter of a year upon anybody.
But this explanation will not apply to the
Americans. The 'North American Review'
has always had on its list of contributors the
very best names in native literature, such as
Longfellow, Everett, J. R. Lowell, Motley,
Jared Sparks, Caleb Cushing, George Bancroft,
and others. Yet its success has been
very partial. Its literary position ought to
have been far more decided. The 'Atlantic
Monthly' holds a deservedly high place
in American letters, with such authors as
Emerson, Holmes, and Mrs. Stowe among
its principal contributors; but its influence
has always been thrown into the scale
against Evangelical Christianity. 'Harper's
Magazine,' published in New York, is an illustrated
monthly for the fashionable world,
with a circulation of 150,000 copies. 'Bonner's
Ledger' has pushed its way into the
front rank of weekly magazines, by its romances,
its essays, and its poetry, from such
writers as Parton, Beecher, Everett, Saxe,
Bryant, and many others. The sporting
world has its <i>Wilkes' Spirit of the Times</i>;
the advocates of woman's rights have the
<i>Revolution</i>, in the hands of Susan B. Anthony
and E. C. Stanton; the grocers have a
<i>Grocers' Journal</i>; the merchants a <i>Dry
Goods Reporter</i>; the billiard-players, a <i>Billiard-cue</i>;
and the dealers in tobacco, a <i>Tobacco
Leaf</i>. The advocates of Spiritualism
and Socialism have a large number of journals
in their service. But, strange to relate,
the Americans have not a single comic periodical
like our 'Punch.' Mr. Maverick says
that, in the course of a dozen years, many
attempts have been made to establish such a
print, but without success. 'Vanity Fair'
was the best of the class, but its wit and its
pictorial illustrations were equally poor and
trivial. All the comic papers that flourished
for a few years were only remarkable for the
immense amount of bad wit they contained,
for a wilderness of worthlessness, for an endless
process of tickling and laughter; with
only an occasional gleam of genuine humour
and imagination. If the Americans have
failed in producing such a periodical, it is
not from the want of literary men possessed
of the <i>vis comica</i>, for Oliver Wendell Holmes,
James R. Lowell, Shelton, Butler, and Saxe
are first-rate humourists. The English comic
papers can command all the abounding talent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
of men like Douglas Jerrold, Albert
Smith, W. M. Thackeray, Mark Lemon,
Shirley Brooks, Thomas Hood, F. Burnand,
and a host of other satirists. The Americans,
however, have never had a Tenniel, a
Doyle, a Leech, a Du Maurier, or a Keene,
to throw off, week after week, the most
amusing and instructive of pictorial satires.
All they have hitherto done in this department
is to copy with tolerable taste and
skill the best cartoons and wood-cuts of
'Punch' and our illustrated magazines. Perhaps
America has yet to find its Bradbury
and Evans. It is evidently most in want of
a publisher. After all, there is hardly anything
the Americans need more than a good
comic paper, to moderate the intensity of
their politics, to laugh down the extravagant
follies of American society, to measure the
strength of their public men, to register their
blunders, and expose their hollowness, to
watch over the caprices of fashion, to criticize
the press itself, with its coarseness and
scurrility, its disgraceful advertisements, and
its downright fabrications; taking good care
to keep free from those sins which so easily
beset satirists, rancour, obscenity, and attacks
on private character. They need a
satirical journal, just to apply to all things
the good old test of common sense; and
when uncommon wit is allied with common
sense in branding any custom or habit as
evil, it must be very deeply rooted if it cannot
be overturned or modified. Besides,
the Americans, as a hard-working race, need
a refreshing humour to relieve the strain upon
their mental and physical energies. Emerson
remarked of Abraham Lincoln, that
humour refreshed him like sleep or wine;
and a nation so eager in all kinds of work
deserves the innocent relaxation that comes
from literature in its most sparkling and
pleasing form.</p>

<p>The volume of Mr. Maverick makes almost
no allusion to an important department
of the American press, which demands some
notice at our hands, viz., that which ministers
to the intellectual and moral wants of
the Irish Roman Catholic immigrants.
There is no city of any magnitude which
does not possess its Catholic organ. New
York city is the proper centre of the Catholic
press, but Philadelphia, Baltimore, Cincinnati,
Pittsburgh, Chicago, Detroit, New
Orleans, Boston, Charleston, and St. Louis
have each their weekly paper for the Irish
population. Intellectually, these papers are
very inferior, and so illiberal that almost
every question is viewed from the single
standpoint of creed, race, or country. The
liberal policy of a free and progressive state
has hardly produced the slightest effect upon
them. It is a very remarkable fact that in
America, as in other countries, journalism is
not wielded in the service of Romanism
with any freshness and power, except by
converts from Protestantism. We find
<i>Brownson's Review</i>, the <i>Freeman's Journal</i>,
the <i>Shepherd of the Valley</i> (now discontinued),
and the <i>Catholic Herald</i>, in the hands
of perverts, just as in Europe the <i>Tablet</i> was
founded by a convert from Quakerism, the
<i>Dublin Review</i> is in the hands of an Oxford
pervert, and the <i>Historisch-politische Bl&auml;tter</i>
of Munich was founded by Professor Phillips,
and maintained in great scientific efficiency
by Yarke, both converts from Lutheranism.
The Irish press in America is very ultramontane.
It seems drunk with the very spirit of
religious servility, mad with the hatred of
liberty, and adopts the strictest Roman
Catholic doctrines, following them out to
their extremest consequences, with a rudeness
and arrogance of style, approaching to
vulgarity. Orestes Brownson says that the
Pope is nowhere so truly Pope, and finds nowhere,
so far as Catholics are concerned, so
little resistance in the full exercise of his
authority as in the United States. No
European editor, except Veuillot, ever wrote
in the style of Brownson himself, who is intellectually
without a peer among Romish
editors; for he takes the strongest and most
unpopular ground as the very foundation
of his ecclesiastical and political theories.
Veuillot shocked the good sense and liberal
feeling of Europe, by defending the Inquisition
and the St. Bartholomew massacre;
but Brownson despises all prudential considerations,
in claiming for his church the
right to put heretics to death, for he holds
that this is punishment, and not persecution.
The <i>Shepherd of the Valley</i> held that the
question of punishing heretics was one of
mere expediency, and declared that in the
event of his church gaining the ascendancy
in America, there would be an end of religious
toleration. The <i>Pittsburgh Catholic</i>
censured these outspoken utterances; but
the <i>Boston Pilot</i> rebuked its Pittsburgh contemporary
for its censures, declaring that the
<i>Shepherd of the Valley</i> said nothing that
was not true; yet saying itself, with marked
inconsistency, 'No Catholic wishes to abridge
the religious rights of Protestants.' It is in
perfect consistency with such ultramontane
ideas that these Irish newspapers uniformly
take the side of royal despots in great national
struggles, and deny all sympathy to
revolutionary leaders except those of Ireland.
Though they usually cry out lustily when any
step in American legislation or any popular
combination manifests even an appearance
of hostility to Catholic interests, they actually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
had the audacity, in 1859, to defend
those royal miscreants of Italy, who rioted
in the misery of their subjects, and of whom
it was truly said, 'They kept one-half of
their people in prison and the other half in
fear of it.' They sympathised with the
Poles in their last insurrection, because their
oppressor was a schismatic; they had no
sympathy with Hungarians, or Italians, or
Spaniards, because their oppressors were
Catholics. The <i>Boston Pilot</i>&mdash;the most
popular journal of the Irish&mdash;forgot its <i>r&ocirc;le</i>
so far in 1848, as to take a liberal view of
the European revolutions. The result was
that the <i>Univers</i>, in giving an account of
Catholic journalism in America, excluded the
<i>Pilot</i> from its list of the orthodox; the
clergy, moreover, condemned it; and it was
obliged to express its penitence for such an
error of judgment. The <i>Pilot</i>, after all, is
more reasonable and less fanatical than most
of the Catholic papers, and is specially
copious in its reports of Catholic news. All
these Irish newspapers are, without exception,
bitterly anti-English in their tone and
spirit. One might suppose that having escaped
from misery and poverty, and launched
upon a new career of prosperity and contentment,
the Irish could afford to forget
England; but, like their teachers at the
press, they are strong in historical grudges,
and their hatred to this country is as much
theological as political. The Irish-American
journalist delights in copying into his paper
the abuse of England, collected from all
quarters of the world, and in times of war
or rebellion depreciates our triumphs and
magnifies our misfortunes. The Catholic
clergy have found it hard to control the
opinions of a portion of their Irish countrymen,
who, though sufficiently submissive in
spiritual concerns, have shown a disposition
to assert an independence of clerical control
in matters affecting the interests of Ireland.
Sometimes, indeed, the clergy have been led
to humour this national feeling, as when
they were in the habit of attending the
'Tom Moore Club,' at Boston, though it had
been more than suspected that the favourite
poet had died out of the pale of the church.
At length the <i>Shepherd of the Valley</i> pointedly
condemned their appearance at the annual
banquet, on the ground that the poet
was ashamed of his country's religion during
life, and that English preachers performed
the obsequies at his grave. The appearance
of Thomas Francis Meagher in America,
after his escape from penal servitude in
Australia, greatly perplexed the bishops and
clergy; but the <i>mot d'ordre</i> went forth, and
all the Catholic newspapers in America, with
a single exception, assailed him with the
greatest bitterness, for his enlightened opinions
upon religious liberty, and upon the relation
between Church and State. Thousands
of the Irish, notwithstanding, rallied round
Meagher; and the <i>Irish-American</i> was established,
for the vindication and enforcement
of his principles. There are a few
other organs of Irish nationality, including
the <i>Irish People</i>, of John Mitchell, published
in America, but, with the exception
of the <i>People</i>, they are all contemptible, in
every point of view. You find in their
pages column after column of windy jargon
and tawdry rhetoric, which would consign an
English editor to a madhouse. This gaudy
and ornate style, with a profusion of florid
imagery and Oriental hyperbole quite overpowering,
seems to characterise every Nationalist
journal. It is these papers that
have inflated the Fenian bubble. We pity
the deplorable ignorance of the Irish masses,
their misguided enthusiasm, and their preposterous
pertinacity in the pursuit of visionary
ends; but we have no language too
severe to apply to their intellectual leaders
who pursue their ignoble calling from a
mercenary calculation of the profits to be
derived from bottomless credulity. We fear
that the Irish press generally has succeeded
in imparting an education to the <i>emigr&eacute;s</i> that
can serve only to nurture hatreds, which, like
curses, too often come home to roost, and
that some considerable time may be expected
to elapse before all the appliances of
American civilization and Christianity shall
succeed, as they most certainly will, in the
assimilation of such intractable materials.</p>

<p>Our notice of the American press would
be incomplete without some account of that
ample supply of religious literature which is
furnished by thousands of weekly, monthly,
and quarterly periodicals. The religious
newspaper is almost peculiar to America,
and is far superior to any similar publication
in England. The English paper is more ecclesiastical
and less religious; the American,
while equally strenuous and careful in the
advocacy of denominational claims, supplies
much of what we usually obtain here from
the <i>Sunday Magazine</i> and the <i>Family
Treasury</i>. The literary superiority of the
religious press over the secular in America
arises mainly from the fact that its conductors
and contributors are mostly clergymen
who have been graduates of colleges, and are
possessed of a considerable amount of classical
culture and training. Every denomination
has a large number of weekly organs.
The two leading newspapers of the class are
the <i>New York Independent</i> and the <i>New
York Observer</i>, the former an organ of the
Congregationalists, and the latter of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
Presbyterians. The <i>Independent</i> was originally
conducted by the Rev. Dr. Bacon, the
Rev. Dr. Thompson, and the Rev. Richard
Storrs, jun.; it afterwards passed into the
hands of the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher,
who wielded it with great power and efficiency
in the anti-slavery cause; and it is now
managed by Theodore Tilton in company
with several others. It contains a great
variety of religious, political, and general
news, devotional and literary pieces of great
merit, together with foreign and domestic
correspondence, written with an excellent
spirit. Mr. Beecher has established, and
conducts, the <i>Christian Union</i>, another religious
paper, which is rapidly rising to
popularity and power. <i>The Advance</i>, a religious
paper published in Chicago, and
conducted by Dr. Patten, is one of the
best of the religious papers of America.
The <i>Observer</i> is one of the oldest and best
established papers, once exceedingly Conservative
in its views of slavery, but always
distinguished by sound judgment, good
taste, and fair culture. The Methodists are
well represented by the <i>Christian Advocate
and Journal</i>, and the Baptists by the <i>Examiner
and Chronicle</i>. The monthly organ
of the American Tract Society has a circulation
of about 200,000, which it owes to its
catholic character and its extraordinary
cheapness. The quarterly literature of the
American churches is of a very high character.
The <i>Bibliotheca Sacra</i> is the great
organ of New England theology, and
the <i>Biblical Repertory and Princeton Review</i>
is the leading representative of the
Calvinism of the Westminster standards.
These are the two most powerful reviews.
The <i>Bibliotheca Sacra</i> is published at Andover,
the scene of the learned labours of
Moses Stuart, the biblical expositor, and was
established twenty-seven years ago. It differs
from the <i>Princeton Review</i> and all
British reviews in publishing the names of
its contributors, and it has succeeded in
gathering to its pages a vast amount of the
most versatile talent from nearly all the Congregational
Colleges of America. Its most
original contributor in the domain of metaphysical
theology is Professor Austin Phelps,
of Andover, whose articles on 'The Instrumentality
of the Truth in Regeneration,' and
'Human Responsibility as related to Divine
Agency in Conversion,' published within the
last two or three years, prove that much of
the genius and spirit of Jonathan Edwards
still exists in New England theology. Another
eminent contributor, Professor Park,
of Andover, who is also its principal editor,
has been frequently in collision with Dr.
Hodge, of the <i>Princeton Review</i>, on points
of Calvinistic divinity. Professor Bascom
has been recently publishing in its pages a
series of articles on 'The Natural Theology
of Social Science'&mdash;a subject hitherto left
too much in the hands of secularists&mdash;and
has succeeded in lifting it with advantage
into the higher sphere of theology. The
articles of this review are generally marked
by a high style of ability and a scientific
thoroughness: and are, many of them,
worthy of being reproduced, as they have
been, from time to time, in the <i>British and
Foreign Evangelical Review</i>. The spirit of
its management is exceedingly liberal. We
observe, for example, that it recently published
an article on 'Christian Baptism,'
from the professor of a Baptist College, in
conformity with a plan adopted by the conductors
of securing from representative men
of different sects and schools of thought, articles
unfolding distinctive, theological opinions,
and exhibiting with something like
scientific precision the exact peculiarities of
meaning attached to the terminology of the
respective schools. The <i>Princeton Review</i>
is the oldest quarterly in the United States.
It was established in 1825 by Dr. Charles
Hodge, the well-known commentator on the
Epistle to the Romans, who was then, and
still is, a Professor in the Princeton Theological
Seminary; but it was not till 1829
that it ceased to be a mere repertory of selections
from foreign works in the department
of biblical literature. It is, beyond
all question, the greatest purely theological
review that has ever been published in the
English tongue, and has waged war in defence
of the Westminster standards for a
period of forty years, with a polemic vigour
and unity of design without any parallel in
the history of religious journalism. If we
were called to name any living writer who, to
Calvin's exegetical tact, unites a large measure
of Calvin's grasp of mind and transparent
clearness in the department of systematic
theology, we should point to this
Princeton Professor. He possesses, to use
the words of an English critic, the power of
seizing and retaining with a rare vigour and
tenacity, the great doctrinal turning-points
in a controversy, while he is able to expose
with triumphant dexterity the various subterfuges
under which it has been sought to elude
them. His articles furnish a remarkably full
and exact repository of historic and polemic
theology; especially those on 'Theories of
the Church,' 'The Idea of the Church,' 'The
Visibility of the Church,' 'The Perpetuity
of the Church,' all of which have been reproduced
in English reviews. The great
characteristic of his mind is the polemic element;
accordingly we find him in collision
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
with Moses Stuart, of Andover, in 1833, and
with Albert Barnes in 1835, on the doctrine
of Imputation; with Professor Park, in 1851,
on 'The Theology of the Intellect and the
Theology of the Feelings;' with Dr. Niven,
of the <i>Mercersburg Review</i>, in 1848, on the
subject of the 'Mystical Presence,' the title
of an article which attempted to apply the
modern German philosophy to the explanation
and subversion of Christian doctrines;
with Professor Schaff, in 1854, on the doctrine
of historical development; and with
Horace Bushnell, in 1866, on vicarious sacrifice.
In fact, a theological duel has been
going on between Andover and Princeton
for nearly forty years, the leading controversialists
of Andover being Stuart, Park,
Edward Beecher, Baird, and Fisher, and
those of Princeton, Hodge, the Alexanders,
and Atwater.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Hodge has contributed one
hundred and thirty-five articles to the <i>Review</i>
since its commencement; Dr. Archibald
Alexander&mdash;a venerable divine, who resembled
John Brown, of Haddington, in
many respects&mdash;contributed seventy-seven;
his son, Dr. James Waddel Alexander, twice
a Princeton Professor, and afterwards pastor
of the wealthiest congregation in New
York, contributed one hundred and one articles;
another son, Dr. Joseph Addison
Alexander, the well-known commentator on
Isaiah, contributed ninety-two, mostly on
classical and Oriental subjects; and Dr. Atwater,
another Princeton professor of great
learning and versatility, contributed sixty-four
on theological and metaphysical subjects.
The articles in the <i>Princeton</i> on
science, philosophy, literature, and history,
have generally displayed large culture and
research. The review of Cousin's Philosophy,
in 1839, by Professor Dod, was one
of the most remarkable papers that appeared
on the subject in America, and was afterwards
reprinted separately on both sides of
the Atlantic. Another theological quarterly
of America, is the <i>New Englander</i>, published
at Newhaven, Connecticut, and representative
principally of Yale scholarship. Nearly
all the leading names in New England
theology, such as Bellamy, Hopkins, Emmons,
Dwight, Griffin, Tyler, and Taylor,
among the dead, and Bushnell, Beecher,
and Bacon, among the living, are associated
with the venerable University of Yale.
Tryon Edwards (the great-grandson of Jonathan
Edwards) is one of the contributors to
the <i>New Englander</i>. The professors and
graduates of the college are its principal
contributors. Among them are to be found
the distinguished names of Dr. Noah Porter
and President Woolsey. The former has
recently contributed to the <i>New Englander</i>,
a series of valuable articles, just reprinted in
a small volume, on 'The American Colleges
and the American Public;' an able discussion
of the fundamental principles of University
education. The <i>Mercersburg Review</i>
is the quarterly organ of the German Reformed
Church, and has been conducted,
from its commencement, by Dr. Niven and
Professor Schaff, the well-known historian.
The Baptists have their <i>Christian Review</i>,
the Methodists their <i>Methodist Quarterly
Review</i>, the Lutherans their <i>Evangelical
Review</i>, the Episcopalians their <i>Protestant
Episcopal Quarterly Review</i>, and the Unitarians
their <i>Christian Examiner</i>, which reflects
from time to time the vicissitudes of
Unitarian opinion. There is one fact suggested
by this review of the American religious
press, viz., that Episcopacy holds a
very inferior place beside Independency and
Presbyterianism in theological authorship.
We all know how greatly things are changed,
even in England, since Dr. Arnold deplored,
and all but despised, the culture of
Dissenters, for we have Dean Alford, but
the other day, confessing in the <i>Contemporary
Review</i>, 'Already the Nonconformists
have passed us by in Biblical scholarship,
and ministerial training.' But in the United
States, the palm of theological scholarship
has always rested in the hands of Congregational
and Presbyterian divines. The best
theological seminaries, the ablest theological
reviews, and the most original as well as extensive
authorship in the various branches
of theology, belong to the two denominations
referred to.</p>

<p>We shall now proceed, as briefly as possible,
to make some observations of a critical
nature upon the intellectual and moral character
of the American press generally. It
is not, certainly, in any spirit of national superiority
that we point to the undoubted
fact that, notwithstanding the great expansion
of newspaper literature in the States,
the wide diffusion of popular education, and
the circulation of English books of the best
kind at a mere nominal cost, the Americans
have as yet produced nothing representatively
like our London <i>Times</i>, or <i>Punch</i>, or
the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, or the <i>Illustrated London
News</i>, or the <i>Saturday Review</i>, or the <i>Art
Journal</i>, or the <i>Edinburgh</i> and <i>Quarterly</i>.
They have not even produced a single great
newspaper writer like Captain Stirling, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
the <i>Times</i>, Albany Fonblanque, sen., of the
<i>Examiner</i>, or Hugh Miller, of the <i>Edinburgh
Witness</i>, for Bennett, Greeley, and Raymond,
though capital editors, are all greatly
inferior to these men in that art of scholarly,
dignified, and tasteful leader-writing, which
gives such a power and charm to London
journalism. Newspaper writing is, perhaps,
the most difficult of all writing; there is
none at least in which excellence is so rarely
attained. The capacity of bringing widely-scattered
information into a focus, of drawing
just conclusions from well-selected facts,
of amplifying, compressing, illustrating a
succession of topics, all on the spur of the
moment, without a moment's stay to examine
or revise, argues great intellectual cultivation.
The articles may not be of a lofty
order, or demand for their execution the
very highest kind of talent, but the power of
accomplishing it with success is very uncommon,
and of all the varieties of ways in
which incompetency is manifested, an irrepressible
tendency to fine writing is associated
with the greater number of them. De
Tocqueville says that democratic journalism
has a strong tendency to be virulent in spirit
and bombastic in style. It certainly runs
the risk of lawlessness, inaccuracy, and irreverence,
with much of vehemence, and with
little taste, imagination, or profundity. One
serious charge we have to bring against the
American newspapers is, that they have
sorely vulgarized and vitiated the English
language. We are aware that many of them
imagine the language of their country to be
the standard as to idiom, pronunciation, and
spelling, and any English variation from their
golden rule as erroneous and heterodox; but
such critics are entitled to no consideration
whatever. If men of education at the American
press refuse to study the style of the
great authors who fixed and purified the language
of our common forefathers, so that
we may have one and not two languages
spoken on opposite sides of the Atlantic, let
them at least imitate such writers of their
own as Washington Irving, Horace Bushnell,
Oliver Wendell Holmes, and Nathaniel
Hawthorne, whose pure and native English
is wholly free from all the corruptions and
affectations of phrase which overrun American
newspapers, simply because it is beautifully
modelled upon the most elegant and polished
writers of English literature. In fact, the Americans
have always been greatly in need of a
critical organ, like the old <i>Edinburgh Review</i>,
to purify the literary atmosphere from the
clouds and mists of false taste which deface
it, to stand censor on books and newspapers,
a recognized authority in the literary republic,
for whose quarterly judgments readers
might look with interest, and authors with
trembling. The <i>North American Review</i>,
though written with great spirit, learning,
and ability, and abounding in profound and
original discussions on the most interesting
subjects, has never filled the place of the
<i>Edinburgh</i>, and, indeed, its own style is not
free from the common sin of affectation. It
is pleasant to think of William Cullen
Bryant, the poet, hanging up in the office of
his newspaper&mdash;the <i>New York Evening
Post</i>&mdash;a catalogue of words that no editor
or reporter is ever to be allowed to use.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Let us hope that the literary men of America,
of all classes, will seriously aim at the
formation of a purer, chaster, and juster
style of writing, for what they have hitherto
produced has been defective in taste rather
than in talent.</p>

<p>Another great sin of American journalism
is its intolerable personality, violence, and
exaggeration. This was the disgrace of our
own English press at no distant period.
Cobbett was a great sinner in this respect,
He had much to do with raising the intellectual,
and lowering the moral, reputation of
the modern newspaper. The wide diffusion
of enlightened views on politics and religion
is attested, however, in a remarkable manner
among ourselves, by the moderation of tone
which we now see in journals which, about
twenty years ago, were remarkable for their
scurrility and violence. It is no longer a
recommendation to an English newspaper to
be known as an assailant of the Royal
Family, the aristocracy, the bench of bishops,
or parsons. Several publications that, a few
years since, professed atheism and secularism,
have become extinct, and the <i>quondam</i>
organs of Chartism and fierce democracy
have been obliged to become respectable.
But many of the American newspapers
are much worse than the English were
a quarter of a century ago. With us, faction
has become less mischievous and shameless;
unfounded accusations less common
and less malignant; invectives more measured
and decorous; not merely because the
evil passions which required to be fed with
the abuse of individuals have calmed down,
but because the British press is now guided
by the principle of attacking public opinion,
not private characters, measures, not men;
and its quarrels are usually governed by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
laws of honour and chivalry, which proscribe
all base advantages. Put an American newspaper
cannot assail another newspaper without
mentioning the editor's name, and calling
him coward or rascal. If you cannot answer
your opponent's objections, you caricature
his appearance, or dress, or diet, or accent,
as Bennett is in the habit of treating
Greeley; and if you are foiled by his wit,
you recover your advantage by stabbing his
character. No allusions become too indecorous
for your taste; no sarcasms too bitter
for your savage spite; and no character pure
enough to be sacred from your charges and
insinuations. The American editor pursues
his antagonist as if he were a criminal. The
<i>New York World</i> lately devoted four columns
of its space to illustrate by quotations
the amenities of American journalism. The
majority of the papers seem to subsist on
the great staple of falsehood and personality,
and enjoy all the advantages which spring
from an utter contempt for the restraints of
decency and candour; and we are strongly
of opinion that this work of cruel intimidation
is pursued with unrelenting eagerness,
not from the influence of angry passions or
furious prejudices, but in the cold-blooded
calculation of the profits which idle curiosity
or the vulgar appetite for slander may enable
its authors to derive from it. We are
not prepared to endorse all the strong statements
made by infuriated rivals concerning
the proprietor of the <i>New York Herald</i>;
but he leaves us, in no doubt, himself, as to
the light in which he regarded his own frequent
chastisements. Immediately after
James Watson Webb had severely whipped
him in the streets of New York, the whole
affair was recounted, in the <i>Herald</i> with a
sensational circumstantiality that had an evident
eye to business, though we cannot
overlook the remarkable good humour with
which Bennett treated the whole affair:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'The fellow,' he says, 'no doubt wanted to
let out the never-failing supply of good humour
and wit which have created such a reputation
for the <i>Herald</i>, and appropriate the contents to
supply the emptiness of his own skull. He
didn't succeed, however, in rifling me of my
ideas. My ideas in a few days will flow as
freshly as ever, and he will find it to his cost.'</p>
</div>

<p>Imagine the London <i>Times</i> degraded to
the condition of its responsible editor rejoicing
in his own personal chastisement!
American journalists fight like their French
brethren. They never dream of explanations.
Bullets and bowie-knives are the natural
sequel of such recriminations as disgrace
their newspapers. This extreme violence
is part of the loose political morality
so common there. Americans seem to be
taught almost from their infancy to hate
one-half of the nation, and so contract all the
virulence and passion of party before they
have come to the age of reason; but before
their newspapers can be said to enter upon
the course of real usefulness which is open
to them, they must have come to believe
that political differences may exist without
their opponents being either rogues or fools.
Jefferson said in his day that the scurrility of
the press drove away the best men from
public life, and would certainly have driven
away Washington had he lived to suffer
from its growing excesses. James Fenimore
Cooper, the celebrated novelist, had a horror
of newspapers, and instituted actions at law
against a host of them for literary libels.
He once remarked, 'The press of this country
tyrannizes over public men of letters, the
arts, the stage, and even private life. Under
the semblance of maintaining liberty, it is
gradually establishing a despotism as ruthless
and grasping and one that is quite as
vulgar as that of any Christian state known.'
This view of the case is certainly serious and
suggestive. Party violence may be carried
to a length that defeats itself, for it may
harden public men against all newspaper
criticism whatever, to the great injury of
public affairs, and thus lower the estimation
and disturb the course of public opinion.
Nowhere are fools more dogmatic than in
politics, and nowhere are wise men more
doubtful and silent; but American party
writers have no respect for the Horatian
maxim, 'in medio tutissimus'&mdash;the secret of
that moderation of opinion which has distinguished
the most genial and sagacious
men in our political world. They must
really learn to cultivate a love of truth and
justice; they should seek to attain the
power of holding the scales steadily, while
the advantages or disadvantages of every
question are fairly weighed; they should
stamp upon their professional life the impress
of personal rectitude and honour, and
not wait&mdash;to copy the tone of the old apologies&mdash;till
a higher standard of public
morals, and a more intelligent cultivation of
political and literary inquiries, shall have
raised for them a new class of readers. It
is the prerogative of genius to create the
light by which it is to be understood and
appreciated; but the working talents of a
country, which are identified with its immediate
interests, ought at least to rise a little
above the surrounding level.</p>

<p>We are led, from this point, to notice another
defect in American journalism,&mdash;the
absence of the anonymous usage, which is,
indeed, mainly answerable for the scurrility
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
and violence already referred to. The
British editor is usually unknown to the public;
the French journalist subscribes his
name at the foot of his articles; but the
American editor publishes his name and address
boldly at the top of his newspaper.
The effect of this custom is to identify the
authority of the journal with the personal
influence of the editor; it tends to a habit
of deciding questions on personal grounds,
and to a far too marked superfluity of the
<i>tu quoque</i> argument. The object of the
American journalist is not so much the instruction
of the public as the political advancement
of himself, for journalism usually
forms the first stage in the course of an ambitious
politician, or a rising statesman; and
the American usage is certainly very well
adapted to this end. Our anonymous habit
limits the discussions of the press and abolishes
egotism, while it certainly tends to
debar personalities. It has been remarked,
as a suggestive fact, that personality is the
common vice of the only free press in the
world, which ignores the anonymous principle;
and that in England, under a contrary
usage, personality is little known, always reprobated,
and, indeed, in cases of flagrant
personal attacks, the authorship is usually
but thinly disguised. It is absurd to defend
the American habits as manly and ours as
cowardly; for their habit tends to make
writers far from circumspect or considerate
of the feelings of others. But, in fact, the
publicity in which American journalists delight
is only akin to the publicity of American
life generally. The British public would
not tolerate the intrusion of the press into
private or family concerns; yet one New
York paper published, in the panic, of 1857,
the name of every gentleman who bought a
silk dress for his wife, or gave a dinner-party
to his friends. Other newspapers criticize
the dress and appearance of ladies at balls
and cricket parties, the personality of their
praise being almost as offensive as at other
times the coarseness of their vituperation.</p>

<p>We confess that we do not entertain a
very high opinion of the morality of the
American press, though we admit there has
been a sensible improvement within the last
thirty years. Emerson made the remark, in
his 'English Traits,' that the London <i>Times</i>
was an 'immoral institution,' on the ground
we presume, of its frequent changes of opinion.
We are far from defending the leading
journal in its policy of tergiversation&mdash;for
there can be no doubt it ever fights on the
stronger side, upholds no falling cause, and
advocates no great principle&mdash;but it was
never yet bought with bribes or cowed by intimidation.
It has sometimes shown that it
is conducted on principles superior to mere
money considerations, for, during the Railway
mania of 1845, when its advertising
sheet was overrun with projected lines of
railway, realizing to the proprietors the
enormous sum of from &pound;2,839 to &pound;6,687
per week, the Thunderer turned its fire on
these projects, and lost nearly &pound;3,000 in a
single week. We do not charge the American
press with any flagrant changes of policy
or principle, for we believe it is, in these
respects, sufficiently consistent. But we deplore
the absence of high moral purpose, as
well as independence in its discussions of
public questions. The American people demand
a large amount of flattery; they have
come almost to loathe the wholesome truth;
they must be pampered with constant adulations,
so that no one will venture to tell
them their faults, and, neither at home nor
abroad, dare moralists venture a whisper to
their prejudice. This is a serious drawback.
America wants more writers of the class
who are said to prefer their country's good
to its favour, and more anxious to reform
its vices than cherish the pride of its virtues.
Besides, we strongly suspect that the American
journalist is very careless about the
truth. We mean the truth of fact, which
is part of the historic disposition of the age,
as opposed to all that is sensational. He resembles
the French rather than the English
journalist in the tendency to regard good
news as more important than correct news.
The English journals make it their business
to present their readers with news and not
advice, with facts and not opinions, so that
they can form opinions for themselves, and
the power of our press is thus enormously
increased, but only on conditions that effectually
prevent the arbitrary exercise of it.
The American writers for the press have followed
our example in some degree, but their
disposition to provide startling and sensational
intelligence is too often manifested at
the expense of truth. Mr. Maverick gives
an account of a number of disreputable
hoaxes played by the newspapers upon the
public of America, which were justified, we
presume, to the consciences of the authors
by the observation of Lord Bacon&mdash;'A
mixture of lies doth ever add pleasure; doth
any man doubt that if there were taken
from men's minds vain opinions, nattering
hopes, false valuations, and the like, it would
leave the minds of a number of men poor
shrunken things?' The 'Moon Hoax,'
which was published in the New York <i>Sun</i>
in 1835, was one of the most skilful and successful
of these literary frauds. Successive
numbers of that paper contained a pretended
extract from the pages of a supplement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
to the <i>Edinburgh Journal of Science</i>, under
the title of 'Great Astronomical Discoveries
latterly made by Sir John Herschel, LL.D.,
F.R.S., at the Cape of Good Hope.' The
paper had a remarkable air of scientific research,
such as might deceive all but the
most learned and wary. The Herschel telescope
was represented as affording a distinct
view of lunar roads, rocks, seas, cascades,
forests, houses, people, and monsters of various
shapes. The 'Roorback Hoax' was
a shameless attempt to injure the character
of J. K. Polk, when he was a candidate for
the Presidency, by representing him as possessing
forty-three slaves who had his initials
branded into their flesh. The deception
was wrought by simply adding to a sentence
in Featherstonehaugh's Travels in America
four lines of the hoaxer's own, recording the
disgraceful lie referred to. We confess that
we cannot recognise the morality of a transaction
which Mr. Maverick records in the
history of the <i>New York Times</i>, without
apparently the slightest suspicion of its dishonesty.
When the <i>New York Herald</i> got
hold of the single survivor of the ill-fated
Atlantic steamer, <i>Arctic</i>, which was lost in
September, 1854, an assistant on the <i>Times</i>
succeeded, by means of an adroit pressman,
in purloining an early copy from the <i>Herald</i>
press-rooms, and actually published the <i>Herald's</i>
report an hour earlier than that journal.
We cannot understand what Mr. Maverick
means by representing the <i>Herald</i>
as 'playing a trick to keep the news from
the other papers,' unless the <i>Herald</i> was
actually bound to supply its contemporaries
gratuitously with the exclusive news it had
obtained from the survivor at its own sole
expense. The transaction seems to us merely
a clever specimen of American 'smartness.'</p>

<p>But we must draw these observations to a
close. We cannot but admit that the press
of America, with all its defects, is an engine
of great power. It is on this ground we
desire for it a close approximation to those
intellectual and moral qualities which have
given British journalism such an influence
over the affairs of the whole world. In fact,
two such nations as America and Britain,
working in the same language, should be
always learning from each other; for the
eager energy of the one should push forward
the occasionally lagging progress of
the other, and our matured caution restrain
their hasty inexperience. America is great
in all that leads to immediate and available
results. She has given us several of the
greatest mechanical inventions of the age;
she has far excelled us in the theory and
practice of religious liberty, as well as in the
more liberal recognition of denominational
brotherhood among the religious sects;
while she has furnished a noble example of
public spirit in the support of religion, missions,
and education. Let us hope that in
time she will equal, if not surpass us in a
periodical literature, which, if even still
more intensely political than ours, will display
a breadth and strength of thought, together
with a wisdom and dignity, which
will add immensely to its power. There is
one aspect of Transatlantic literature which
already contrasts favourably with our own,
and that is its generally cordial recognition
of Evangelical Christianity. With the exception
of the German and French newspapers,
which chafe under the restraints of a
Christian country, and scoff at Judaic sabbaths,
Pharisaic church-going, and tyrannical
priestcraft, there are no newspapers of any
position in the States that are avowedly anti-Christian;
and there is less disposition than
formerly, on the part of the American press
generally, to exclude all reference to distinctive
Christianity. It was considered a remarkable
circumstance at the time of the
American revival that several newspapers,
notorious for a thinly disguised infidelity,
and for a most undisguised enmity to Evangelical
religion, should not only publish the
most ample reports of the movement, but
commend it in a way that has had no parallel
in English journalism, even before the
tide of public opinion had turned decisively
in its favour. It is the common custom
still for American newspapers to print the
sermons of popular preachers, and to publish
a large amount of religious intelligence.
The press is also intensely Protestant, and
has contributed to the growth of that enormous
assimilating power by which American
Protestantism has absorbed generation after
generation of the Roman Catholic emigrants.
The statistics of the Propaganda declare
that one half of the whole number has been
lost to the Church of Rome; and the explanation
is, that they can no more escape from
the influence of American ideas than from
the effects of the atmosphere and climate.</p>

<p>It becomes, therefore, a matter of the
greatest consequence that the literary guides
of a nation with such a destiny as America,
should understand the responsibilities under
which their power is exercised. They should
take care, above all things, to use their influence
not to materialize the mind of society, by
obtruding material concerns too much upon
the attention, to the neglect of those moral
and spiritual interests which constitute the
very foundations of its greatness. This is a
real danger, for, as De Tocqueville remarks,
the tendency of modern democracy is to concentrate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
the passions of men upon the acquisition
of comforts and wealth. They
cannot be ignorant that the most clearly
marked line of social progress over the whole
world is coincident with the line of the Christian
faith; that wherever true religion has had
free access to the centres of human action, a
palpable advance has been made in knowledge,
liberty, and refinement; while poverty, injustice,
and licentiousness, which are the
ulcers of a depraved society, have in that
degree been checked and healed. They
must understand that honesty is the grand
necessity of the world at this time, in its
politics as well as its theology, in its commerce
as well as its science. Let these things
be understood by the leaders of American
thought, and we cannot but anticipate a
proud future for their country. It is a subject
of just congratulation to England that her
children have stamped their character on a vast
continent, and, that instead of discontented
colonies subjected to her caprice, she
can now point to a great people, with all the
best life of the ancient nations throbbing in
their veins, flourishing exactly in proportion
to their freedom, and trained, through all
their bloody disasters which almost threatened
to ruin their work, to build a stronger
rampart, and to reclaim a broader shore for
posterity. The interests of humanity demand
that a nation so strong in all the material
elements of civilization, and manifesting
such an impetuous disregard of limit and
degree in all its enterprises, should be equally
strong in its intelligence and its Christianity.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><span class="smcap">Art. II.</span>&mdash;<i>Report from the Royal Commission
on International Coinage. 1868.</i></p>

<p class="p2">Although during the deplorable struggle
between Germany and France public attention
has been of necessity mainly directed to the
conflict, yet it is impossible, for many reasons,
to do otherwise than regret this concentration
of interest. The last session of our Parliament
was fertile to an unusual degree in
measures of public utility and importance;
but it is not too much to say that the difficulties
incurred by several of these measures
in their passage through both Houses would
have been greatly enhanced had the engrossing
events which have recently agitated all
Europe occurred at the time. The only satisfaction
which can be obtained in contemplating,
even from a distance, the misery inflicted
on such countless thousands, arises from
the hope that when the last echoes of the
strife have faded away, a peace, firm and
durable&mdash;durable because based on sound
principles&mdash;may link together those nations
who are now suffering from the effects of the
struggle. Till this is the case, the evils
arising from the war will not be confined to
those actually engaged in it. Meanwhile, it
is really no slight misfortune that many subjects,
not unimportant to the country, should
fail to obtain the attention which they would
otherwise have received, in consequence of
the superior interest of the central European
crisis.</p>

<p>Professor Jevons' remarks at the late
meeting of the British Association at Liverpool,
on the manner in which points of importance
were thus swamped, will not readily
be forgotten by those who heard them.
Among other subjects, the Professor instanced
that of an international coinage,
which, after having received considerable
and careful attention, had receded for a
time from that prominence which it deserved.</p>

<p>In this country, the question has been
considered from two points of view&mdash;the
one taken by those who are desirous to
adopt a universal system of coinage, as well
as a universal system of weights and measures;
the other, by those who are aware of
the present and increasing deterioration of
the gold coinage of the country, arising
from the number of coins deficient in full
weight which are now in circulation.</p>

<p>Neither of these points have escaped the
notice of the active mind of the present
Chancellor of the Exchequer (Right Hon.
R. Lowe). He has become aware that many
of the gold coins now in circulation are below
the legal tender weight; that the opportunity
of a considerable re-coinage might
be made use of to assimilate the weight of
gold in the sovereign to that contained in
twenty-five francs, and that in doing this
the expense incurred in the coinage of gold
might, by means of a seigniorage, be spared
to the country.</p>

<p>To explain these points, it will be well, in
the first place, to refer to a report of the
then Master of the Mint, and Colonel Smith,
late Master of the Calcutta Mint, in reply to
the question put by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'What would it cost, first to manufacture a
sovereign, and afterwards to keep it in good condition
for all time? The coin is always losing
weight by wear, while it passes from hand to
hand, and ends by becoming light (after three-quarters
of a grain of gold have been lost), and
is no longer current. The individual piece has
thus a limited existence, and must be withdrawn
and replaced by a new sovereign of full
weight; that, again, by another in due time;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
and so on. Now, for what present payment
could this succession be maintained? What is
the contract price to cover the first construction,
and all future restoration?'<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>
</div>

<p>To put it in another shape. The person
who thinks it worth his while to convert his
gold bullion into coin, according to this
plan, is to pay for the expense of manufacture,
and is also called upon to contribute to
a reserve fund, by means of which the
natural deterioration of the coin he has
caused to be put into circulation is to be
provided for.</p>

<p>The coinage of gold in this country is&mdash;and
it is well to explain this point at the
outset&mdash;entirely gratuitous as far as the Government
is concerned. That is to say, any
person possessing gold bullion of the required
purity of standard, may, if he
chooses, take that bullion to the Mint. And,
in due time, the officers of the Mint will return
him&mdash;weight for weight&mdash;an equal
quantity of gold coin. <i>In due time</i>, however,
means in practice, a considerable delay;
and delay in money matters means loss
of interest. Hence, it arises, that in the
natural course of events, no private person
takes gold bullion to be coined, himself.
But he carries it to the Bank of England.
Now, that great corporation, among other
duties to the State, has this particular
charge. It is bound to buy all gold bullion
of standard fineness offered to it, at the rate
of &pound;3 17s. 9d. per oz. These payments are
made in bank notes; and as bank notes are
immediately exchangeable for sovereigns,
the result is, that any one possessing gold
bullion of the Mint standard, can at once
and immediately turn that bullion into gold
coins for the slight cost of 1<sup>1</sup>/<span class="s08">2</span>d. per oz., or
something less than <sup>1</sup>/<span class="s08">2</span>d. for every sovereign.
This is really buying a sovereign at cost
price, for the mere manufacture of a sovereign
costs fully a <sup>1</sup>/<span class="s08">2</span>d., as will be mentioned
further on. What is more, the payment,
small as it is, does not accrue to the Government,
but is retained by the Bank of
England, and is considered as being only
sufficient to compensate that institution for
the trouble and expense of the operation,
including the loss of time, and consequent
loss of interest incurred. No provision is
made to include the loss by wear, which,
though imperceptible at the moment, accumulates
in process of time to a large
amount. Investigation shows that 100
sovereigns lose 8d. a year by fair usage. If
the amount of British gold coin in circulation
amounts, as it is supposed to do, to
eighty millions, sixty-eight being whole
sovereigns, and twelve millions in halves,
the annual loss would amount to &pound;35,000
from deterioration due to wear alone. The
charge for manufacturing sovereigns is not
high when all that has to be done is taken
into consideration. Great precautions have
to be taken in the process to secure the
needful quality. Each bar has to be brought
to the required standard. Careful assays are
made, and great exactness in the weight of
each coin is, of course, essential. All these
points cannot be attended to without considerable
expense. Again, the great amount
of valuable property in the shape of coin
and bullion necessitates vigilant watching.
The total charge is estimated at <sup>1</sup>/<span class="s08">2</span>d. each
sovereign. Half sovereigns are, in proportion
to value, more expensive to strike than
sovereigns. They also wear more rapidly.
This arises from greater rapidity of circulation,
and also from the fact that, weight for
weight, each half sovereign presents a
greater surface for abrasion than a sovereign.
After making careful calculations, the Master
of the Mint and Colonel Smith arrived at
the conclusion that a charge of &pound;1 13s. 6d.
for every &pound;100 coined would be sufficient to
cover all expenses. That is to say, that if
an arrangement were made with a contractor
to undertake to manage the Mint, and to
keep the gold coinage in good repair, he
would require, to hold him harmless from
loss, to be paid about &pound;1 13s. 6d. for every
&pound;100 in the average proportion of sovereigns
and half sovereigns put into circulation.
And this sum is at the present time lost to
the community.</p>

<p>It is characteristic of the manner in which
public questions are handled in this country,
that throughout the report, to which is
attached the name of an official in such high
place as that of the late Master of the Mint,
continual reference is made to the investigations,
not of a public officer, but of Mr.
Jevons, Professor of Political Economy in
Owen's College, Manchester. Mr. Jevons,
being desirous of ascertaining the condition
of the gold currency, made inquiries of
bankers and other suitable persons in all
parts of the United Kingdom, requesting
them</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'to take one or two hundred pounds in sovereigns,
and half the amount in half-sovereigns,
from gold received in the ordinary course of
business, and to cause the number of coins of
each date to be counted and stated. The aid
thus requested was furnished with a readiness
which I had no right to expect, and which I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
cannot sufficiently acknowledge. Not a few
gentlemen, on becoming acquainted with my
purpose, procured very extensive returns, and
the final result was, that this kind of census of
the gold coinage was extended over one-sixth of
a million of coins, thus composed:</p>

<table summary="Gold Coinage">
<tr><td>Number of sovereigns enumerated</td><td class="tdr">90,474</td></tr>
<tr><td>Number of half-sovereigns enumerated</td><td class="tdru">75,036</td></tr>
<tr><td>Total number</td><td class="tdr">165,510</td></tr>
</table>

<p>'At least one gold coin in every hundred now
existing in this country was, on the average,
enumerated; and, as there were 321 separate
returns received from 213 distinct towns or localities,
including almost every place of commercial
importance, it may be allowed, I think,
that sufficient data were acquired for determining
the average character of the circulation.'&mdash;<i>Journal
of the Statistical Society</i>, vol.
xxxi., p. 439.</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Jevons' inquiry was, as he describes
it, made in a private manner, but it was, beyond
question, conducted most efficiently
and thoroughly. And there is no reason to
doubt that he has rather under-estimated
than over-estimated the case when he states,
that about 45 per cent. of the sovereigns
and 62 per cent. of the half-sovereigns now
in circulation in the country are lighter than
the legal standard. If this statement appears
excessive to any one, he can easily
verify it for himself. He has only to go to
his banker, in whatever part of the United
Kingdom he may reside, and ask him to
provide out of the gold in his till&mdash;out of
the ordinary circulation of the locality&mdash;100
sovereigns of <i>full</i> weight. Then, if he inquires
how many sovereigns have been
picked over to obtain this number, he will&mdash;within
those reasonable limits of variation
which every similar calculation is liable to&mdash;find
that Mr. Jevons' statement gives a correct
idea of the ordinary circulation.</p>

<p>But Mr. Lowe, as will have been observed,
did not confine himself to the actual deterioration
of the existing British gold circulation.
His thoughts took a wider range&mdash;'a
coin which would have the advantage of
an international circulation' occurred to him
as a possible thing&mdash;and, further, that the
British sovereign, reduced to an exact equation
with twenty-five francs of gold coin of France,
Italy, Belgium, Switzerland, &amp;c., might be
such a coin. The question of the desirability
of an international coinage has frequently
been discussed. From some of the
remarks which have been made on Mr.
Lowe's speech, it might have been imagined
to be only a recent idea. But this is far
from being the case. Much attention was
drawn to the point in 1851. The difficulty
then experienced in comparing the value of
the articles produced in different countries
and shown at the Great Exhibition, naturally
suggested the idea of a coinage common to
all nations. The International Statistical
Congress then took the matter up at their
meetings at Brussels, in 1853, and at Paris,
in 1855, and at London, in 1860. This last-named
meeting was held under the presidency
of the late Prince Consort, and his
address on its opening was the last public
speech delivered by him. In it are to be
found these words, which show that the importance
of the question of international
coinage had not escaped the notice of the
Prince:&mdash;'The different weights, measures,
and currencies, in which different statistics
are expressed, cause further difficulties and
impediments. Suggestions with regard to
the removal of these have been made at
former meetings, and will, no doubt, be renewed.'
Before this meeting separated, an
international commission was formed to report
on the question. Further consideration
was given to it at Berlin, in 1863. In December,
1865, the idea was put into practice.
A formal convention was entered into
by France, Belgium, Italy, and Switzerland;
and those four countries established an international
currency among themselves. The
French Government followed up the subject
by giving official notice of this convention,
inviting this country, with many others, to
send commissioners to attend a conference
'for the purpose of deliberating upon the
best means of securing a common basis for
the adoption of a general international
coinage.'</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'The Conference was attended by thirty-three
delegates, representing twenty different
countries, viz.:&mdash;Austria, Baden, Bavaria, Belgium,
Denmark, France, Great Britain, Greece,
Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Prussia, Russia,
Spain, Sweden and Norway, Switzerland, Turkey,
United States, Wurtemburg.'</p>

<p>'The delegates were not authorized in any
way to bind their respective countries, but
they voted according to their own opinions.'</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>'Great value seems to be attached to the cooperation
of England in any measure of this
description. England has been forward in
urging the policy of free trade upon Continental
nations; and while her joining in any
movement originated abroad for promoting and
facilitating commercial intercourse would be
most favourably received, and would increase
her influence among them, her declining altogether
to enter upon it might appear to be inconsistent
with her general conduct upon such
questions.'</p>

<p>'The recommendations of the Conference
may be shortly stated to be:</p>

<p>'I. The adoption of a single gold standard.</p>

<p>'II. The adoption of <sup>9</sup>/<span class="s08">10</span> as the proportion
of fine gold in the coins.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<p>'III. That all gold coins hereafter struck
in any of the countries which are parties to the
Convention, should be either of the value of
five francs or multiples of that sum.</p>

<p>'IV. That a gold coin of the value of
twenty-five francs should be struck by such
countries as prefer it, and be admitted as an
international coin.</p>

<p>'In other countries steps have been taken
with a view to promote a general international
coinage.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>'A Bill has been introduced into the Congress
of the United States for altering the value of
the American coinage, so as to assimilate it to
that of the Convention of 1865; and we have
received the report of the Finance Committee
of the Senate of the United States, recommending
the adoption of the measure, with certain
amendments; together with a report also presented
to the Senate, adverse to the passing of
the Bill.</p>

<p>'A Bill has been introduced into the Canadian
Parliament for the regulation of the currency
of that country, in which provision is
made for the adoption by Canada of the system
of the Convention, in the event of the measure
above referred to becoming law in the United
States.</p>

<p>'Another Bill has been introduced into the
Congress of the United States, in order to assimilate
the coinage to that of this country,
making the half eagle equal to our sovereign.</p>

<p>'The Federal Parliament of the North German
Confederation has passed a resolution declaring
necessary the adoption of a decimal
monetary system.</p>

<p>'Finally, we have received a communication
from the Foreign Office, by which it appears
that the Government of Sweden have proposed
to strike a gold coin equivalent to ten francs,
and further to coin pieces of twenty-five francs
as soon as such a coin shall be struck in
France.'&mdash;<i>Report from the Royal Commission
on International Coinage</i>, 1868.</p>
</div>

<p>The Spanish Government has recently
given notice of being willing to join the Convention
(Nov., 1869), and the pattern pieces
of the twenty-five franc coin have already
been struck at the Paris mint.</p>

<p>This brief <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of what has actually
been done by several other nations, suffices
of itself to show that the question deserves,
as Mr. Lowe has stated in Parliament, very
careful consideration.</p>

<p>Four nations, with more than sixty-six
millions of inhabitants, already possess an
international coinage. That is to say, any
merchant in the furthest point to which the
Convention extends knows at once, if he
takes up a paper with the prices current at
Paris, Marseilles, Bordeaux, or any of the
great centres of commerce, what those prices
mean, and how nearly they correspond with
his own. Other nations besides France, Belgium,
Switzerland, Italy, are prepared to join
in this uniform coinage. It is not unlikely that
the sixty-six millions may be more than
doubled shortly. Will it not be a great disadvantage
to the thirty or thirty-two millions
inhabiting these islands to be outside this
great confederation?</p>

<p>The values of the gold in the pound sterling
and in twenty-five francs approximate
very closely. To enable this country to join
the confederation, it would be needful for
the values to be equalized. This must be
done in one of two ways.</p>

<p>Either the amount of gold contained in
the proposed coin of twenty-five francs
must be increased by twenty centimes to
make it the equivalent of the English full-weight
sovereign. Or, the weight of gold
in the English sovereign must be diminished
to make it equal to that contained in the 25-franc
piece. The Royal Commissioners on
International Coinage appear to have entertained
an aspiration&mdash;it can hardly be termed
a hope&mdash;that the former plan would be
adopted; but it can scarcely be looked for.
The inconvenience to the nations who have
already joined the Convention would be so
great as to preclude the idea. The other
alternative alone practically has to be considered.
It amounts to this: that 2d. in
value should be taken out of every sovereign.
But to do this without due compensation
would be to alter every existing contract.
A seigniorage to be charged on all bullion
taken to the mint to be coined, is proposed
as a method of bridging over this difficulty.
To effect this such a charge or seigniorage
would have to be proportionate to the amount
of bullion subtracted from each sovereign.</p>

<p>It is desirable to trace out what effect
such a charge would have. It would be&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'tantamount to an enhancement of the purchasing
value of the coinage in the country of
its currency. It immediately augments the
value of the coinage as expressed in its exchange
value for bullion, unless the weight of
pure metal in the coinage be simultaneously
reduced to the same extent as the amount of
the seigniorage. The following may serve as
a test example, and avoid the necessity for the
use of fractions:&mdash;"What would be the effect
of a seigniorage of 1 per cent, in a country
where it is imposed for the first time?" It
would be this: that whilst the pieces of current
coin before the imposition of the seigniorage
were exactly worth their weight in uncoined
bullion of the same intrinsic fineness,
they would, after its imposition, be worth 1
per cent, more than their weight in bullion of
the like standard.'&mdash;<i>Mr. Hendriks' Evidence,
Royal Commission on International Coinage</i>,
p. 142.</p>
</div>

<p>The sovereign, thus diminished in weight,
would still possess exactly the same purchasing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
power&mdash;within the limits of the country&mdash;as
it previously had. Beyond those limits,
as shown by the practice of the French mint
authorities, it would still retain its value. It
would not be, as the present sovereign now
is, undervalued in consequence of the mint
charges of other nations.</p>

<p>An objection may be, and has already
been, made to the alteration&mdash;that such a
change would be unfair to all those creditors
who had made contracts in the old coin, and
would be repaid in the new. This objection
is sufficiently disposed of by the fact that,
as mentioned before, the purchasing power
of the new coin will be equal to that of the
old.</p>

<p>If any doubt existed, a further security
might be given under all circumstances, by
adopting the plan recommended by Colonel
Smith, the late Master of the Calcutta Mint.
His proposal is, 'that the new sovereign
shall be changeable for gold bullion at the
present price.' This would cause the value
of the new coin to remain equal with that of
the present coin, exactly as the value of the
existing silver coinage is maintained. The
present shilling, even when of full weight,
is by no means worth its weight in the metal
of which it is made. The pound troy of
standard silver is, and has been in England,
since 1817, coined into sixty-six shillings.
The value of the shilling, thus debased, is
maintained at the proper level by the coin
being limited, as a legal tender, to 42s. by
tale. The result is obvious. Silver of the
value of something like 18s. does service for
20s. What is more, this has been the case
for years, and no one has ever been injured
by it. And the same effect would surely
follow if Colonel Smith's plan were carried
out. If the holder of 100 sovereigns were
to desire to convert them into gold, he
would take them to the Bank of England,
who would give, as now, a certain quantity
of bar gold of standard fineness, at &pound;3 17s.
10<sup>1</sup>/<span class="s08">2</span>d. per oz. The sovereign would, to a
certain extent, become a 'token' coin; that
is to say, each sovereign would, as the shilling
is now, be worth something less than
the stamped value. But it would, within
the limits of the convention, that is, within
the limits of the civilized world, be current
exactly to the extent of its nominal value;
and any one desiring to employ it beyond
the limits of the Convention would be
placed in exactly the position in which he is
now, by simply taking his gold coins to the
Bank of England and exchanging them for
bar gold. A further advantage would arise
from this diminution in weight of the sovereign.
As the sovereign is worth a fraction
over ten rupees in India, it follows that the
internationalization of the English sovereign,
and the reducing it by about twopence, to
make it equal with twenty-five francs or five
dollars, would immediately rectify the present
difference between the British sovereign
and the 10-rupee piece; and the rupee, the
British florin, and the Australian florin
would, in the international scheme of coinage,
ultimately become absolutely identical,
so far at least as gold coinage is concerned.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Any alteration of coin in so backward a
country as India would have to be introduced
with great caution; but the advantage
of assimilating the currency to that of this
country cannot be doubted. There are
great disadvantages in allowing coins, nearly
identical in value, to circulate together; and
if the 'sovereign' remains at the present value,
what Mr. Jevons anticipates may not be unlikely
to happen.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'It is only necessary for the Continental nations
and the United States to issue, as is already
proposed, a piece of twenty-five francs in
order to supplant the sovereign; for, as the
new coin would have the value of a well-worn
sovereign, it would soon be accepted equally
with the sovereign in all foreign countries and
our colonies, if not at home. At the same
time, the difference of value being about 2d. in
the pound, would ensure the melting of all new
sovereigns in preference. Thus, however many
sovereigns are coined, we should never succeed
in dislodging the 25-franc piece from circulation.
More even than at present our British
Mints would perform the labours of the Dana&iuml;des,
ever pouring forth new and beautiful
coin, at once to disappear into the bullion dealer's
crucible. The sovereign would be an
evanescent coin, constantly liable to be recoined
with the permanent impress of a foreign
mint. Common sense, as well as invariable
experience, tells us that we must be worsted in
this contest of the heavier and the lighter
coin.'&mdash;<i>Professor Jevons' Paper in the Journal
of the Statistical Society</i>, vol. xxxi., p. 429.</p>
</div>

<p>The extent of the populations employing
the 20-franc piece as their principal gold
coin, has already been mentioned. Some
persons may say, 'It is true these nations
more than double in number the persons
whose basis of accounts is the pound sterling;
but still there may be more "sovereigns"
in existence than 20-franc pieces.'
Now, it is by no means as easy to enumerate
the coins in a country as to make a census
of the inhabitants. You may count the
dwellers in the poorest hovel. But you
cannot count the coins hidden under the
hearth, or in the end of the stocking.
It is, however, by no means clear that the
amount of British gold coin in existence is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
as much as that circulated by several other
nations. Sovereigns, so far from preponderating,
appear to be in an absolute minority.
At the Paris Conference of 1867, the
amounts of the gold coinage of Great Britain,
France, and the United States were
stated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="1867 Gold Coinage" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>France, from 1793 to 1866, of the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;value of </td><td class="tdr">&pound;262,444,160</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>Great Britain, 1816 to 1866</td><td class="tdr">187,068,290</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>

</table>

<p>It is, of course, impossible to state with
certainty what proportion of coins struck at
any mint at any time remain in existence
afterwards. Some coins are called in, some
are lost, others find their way to the melting-pot:
it is impossible to say how many
continue to circulate. One thing, however,
is certain, that whatever casualties of this
nature any coins are exposed to, British
coins feel to the fullest extent. The rapidity
of circulation in Great Britain tends to great
deterioration from wear and tear. The absence
of seigniorage causes our coinage to be
relatively undervalued in proportion to other
gold coins.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Even supposing British coins
to remain current as long as those of other
nations, they are certainly less numerous.
They are probably far less frequently hoarded.
The coinage returns from 1851 to 1866
inclusive show the relative proportions even
more clearly than the earlier statements.
Our Mint was less fertile during that time,
than either the Mints of France or the
United States.</p>

<p>The amount of gold coin in a country is
very far from being an indication, either of
its wealth or of its business transactions;
but these figures suffice to show that the
sovereign does not hold the pre-eminence frequently
ascribed to it. Even if the proceeds
of the Sydney Mint are added in, the sovereign
will still be found in the minority.
The Sydney Mint was established in 1855.
The coinage has been as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>
And it must not be assumed that all these
Australian sovereigns are in circulation now.
An imperfection in the process of refining
incident on carrying on that operation in a
new country, left a certain portion of silver
at all events in the earlier mintages, and
this circumstance is believed to have made
these coins favourites with the 'melters.'
Sir A. Donaldson, formerly Colonial Secretary,
and Colonial Treasurer to the Government
of New South Wales, gave evidence
before the Select Committee of the House
of Commons on the Sydney Branch Mint,
appointed in 1862; and, after stating that he
believed that a considerable number of the
Australian sovereigns have reached England,
added, 'as a matter of fact, I think they
all find their way to the refiner.' Mr. W.
Miller, of the Bank of England, when examined
before the same Committee, 'understood
that upwards of 2,000,000 were sent
to this country some time ago, and that they
have been melted.' This was before the
proclamation making these coins legal tender
in this country. They have probably been
less frequently melted since that proclamation.
But it cannot be assumed that the
whole twenty millions are still in circulation.
Even including all of them, the sovereign
would not be the preponderating coin as far
as number is concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. Hendriks, a very eminent statistician,
who has paid much attention to questions
connected with the coinage (<i>vide Journal of
the Society of Arts</i>, February 14, 1868),
has given to the public the grounds upon
which he bases his opinion that, although
the sovereign and the dollar may be more
widely diffused than the Napoleon, there are
now current in the world twice as many Napoleons
as sovereigns, four times as many as
half-eagle or five-dollar pieces, and about
one-third more than sovereigns and half-eagle
pieces together. This writer has also
made the following calculations, showing
the relative importance of the United States,
England, and France, as the chief manufacturing
countries of coinage since 1792.
The object of the division of the results into
separate periods is to show the altered condition
since the gold discoveries in California
and Australia.</p>

<p>In further commenting, in the pages of
the <i>Economist</i>, on these statistics, Mr. Hendriks observes:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'It thus appears that whilst England coined
48<sup>2</sup>/<span class="s08">3</span> per cent., or nearly one-half, of the grand
total from 1792 to 1851, her proportion has
fallen from the first place to the last, in the
subsequent period 1851 to 1866, her fresh
coinage having therein sunk to 21<sup>1</sup>/<span class="s08">2</span> per cent.,
or a little more than one-fifth of the total. The
proportion for France was 33 per cent. in the
first period, and 47 per cent. in the second.
From the second place she thus moved to the
first. But the advance of the United States
was equally marked, and from the smallest
proportion, 18<sup>1</sup>/<span class="s08">3</span> per cent, in the period 1792 to
1851, there was an increase to 31<sup>1</sup>/<span class="s08">2</span> per cent., or
to the second place, in the period 1851 to
1866.</p>

<p>'The report from the Secretary of the American
Treasury for 1868 gives more recent statistics,
namely, for the years ended 30th June,
1867 and 1868. These show a gold coinage of
about forty million dollars in 1867, and of
about twenty-four million dollars in 1868.
But in England, in 1867, the gold coined was
actually less than half a million sterling, or
under two and a half million dollars' worth in
American coin. And in 1868 the English Mint
turned out only &pound;1,653,384 sterling, or about
eight million dollars' worth in American coin.
The gold coinage of France has also declined
below the rate of fresh production in America.
Thus America is rapidly attaining the first
place as a gold coining country. And it will
be a question for future time to solve, whether
the English and Australian Mints, in their
united working, will exceed the manufacture
by the United States' Mints at Philadelphia,
San Francisco, and Denver.'</p>
</div>

<p>As some persons may say, 'Other nations
need a larger gold coinage than we do, because
their paper money and banking systems
are not like ours; but their coinage is
no proof of the extent of their business transactions,'
it is best to mention that the united
export and import trade of the European
countries alone, who have already joined the
Monetary Convention, or have signed preliminary
treaties of adherence thereto, amounts
to no less than five hundred million pounds
sterling per annum at the present time, or to
nearly one-fourth more than the aggregate
exports and imports of the United Kingdom.
It will now be desirable to mention the
charges made for coining, or seigniorage, at
the principal mints. In England no charge
is made; but the 1<sup>1</sup>/<span class="s08">2</span>d paid to the Bank on
each ounce of standard gold bullion, amounts
to about 0&middot;1605 (say 3s. 2<sup>1</sup>/<span class="s08">2</span>d.) per cent. In
France it is different. When gold is carried
to the mint there, coin is returned for it,
with a certain deduction. This deduction is
about <sup>1</sup>/<span class="s08">4</span> per cent. Beyond this there is
some delay, practically, before the coin is
returned. On an average the loss of interest
on the money, caused by this delay, amounts
to about <sup>3</sup>/<span class="s08">4</span> per cent. Altogether, the charge
is about 1 per cent., or more than six times
the charge now made in England. In Prussia
the charge is <sup>1</sup>/<span class="s08">2</span> per cent., and the delay is
about the same as in Paris. In America and
India it is about the same.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>It appears from these statements that there
is nearly a universal consensus of practice in
charging a seigniorage. There is also a
nearly universal consensus of opinion on the
part of the leading authorities in political
economy (such as Adam Smith and J. S.
Mill) that such a seigniorage, when moderate,
really enhances the value of the coin to the
extent of the charge. If, therefore, this opinion
is correct, it follows that the gold coinage
of England, where no charge is made,
will be depreciated&mdash;that is, will not obtain
its real value in those countries where a
charge is made. It is not difficult to show
that this is the case in France; and if in one
country where a seigniorage is charged, it
follows, of course, in all of them.</p>

<p>A British sovereign of full weight contains
about equal intrinsic quantities of pure gold
with twenty-five francs twenty centimes.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'But it does not follow that even a full-weight
sovereign is more valuable, either in a mathematical
or in a commercial sense, than twenty-five
francs of gold coin, when it is conveyed to
a country within the operation of the Monetary
Convention of December, 1865. There the
sovereign ceases to be coin, and is nothing
more than bullion; and, as bullion, is subject
to a seigniorage or mint-charge, when converted
into coin. And as, in the countries in question,
twenty-five francs twenty centimes of bullion
are, on the average, equal to only twenty-five
francs of coin, the sovereign is practically
"valuable" only as twenty-five francs.'&mdash;<i>Royal
Commission on International Coinage. Evidence
of Mr. Hendriks</i>, p. 145.</p>
</div>

<p>The reason for this must be that the
British coinage is gratuitous. A sovereign
may be regarded from two points of view&mdash;as
a certain weight of gold of a known fineness,
manufactured into a uniform shape by
the officials of the mint, and as the current
coin of the realm. At present no charge is
made for the process of manufacture. The
question to be decided is this, Is the coin,
<i>plus</i> the process of manufacture, worth more
than the same weight of gold before that
process is performed? It appears that it is
even worth less in France.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'The French Mint publishes a tariff giving a
schedule of the coinage of each country, the
legal weight and fineness in the country of its
mintage, and a comparative estimate of fineness,
according to the French Mint tariff of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
purchase, stating the value of each coin per
kilogramme and per single piece.'</p>
</div>

<p>If the intrinsic value of the pure gold
contained in the sovereign is considered, it
is equal to 25&middot;2079 at par; but the Mint
tariff giving the price of purchase makes it
only 25&middot;12 at par, a deduction of about nine
centimes on each sovereign. In estimating
it thus,</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'The French Mint Commission and M. Durand,
its Commissioner-General, practically admit
that current gold coin in France is equal in exchange
to its full legal weight of bullion, <i>plus</i>
seigniorage. In order to test this with mathematical
exactness, we must observe that a kilogramme,
<i>i.e.</i>, 1,000 grammes of absolutely
pure gold without deduction for seigniorage or
mint charges, is worth 3444&middot;4444 francs; or,
<i>with</i> deduction at the rate of 6 francs 70 centimes,
on 3,100 francs, <sup>9</sup>/<span class="s08">10</span> fine, the 1,000
grammes of absolutely pure gold, <sup>10</sup>/<span class="s08">10</span> fine, are
worth 3,437 francs. Then, at &middot;916 fine, <i>i.e.</i>,
at the French Mint tariff of English gold coin
treated as bullion, the proportionate value of
the kilogramme of sovereigns, allowing for
seigniorage or mint charge, comes out as given
in the tariff, 3148&middot;29 francs. And thus, doubtless,
the French Mint arrives at its present
equation of 25&middot;12 francs = 1 sovereign. For
the proportion is, 1,000 <i>grammes</i> : 3148&middot;29
francs :: 7&middot;98085 grammes : x = 25&middot;12602
francs.'&mdash;<i>Royal Commission on International
Coinage. Mr. Hendriks' Evidence</i>, p. 146.</p>
</div>

<p>It appears by this that the pound sterling
is practically undervalued 2d. in France;
one penny about in the intrinsic worth of
the gold; and another, the cost of coining
the metal, including the loss for delay in so
doing.</p>

<p>Any alteration in the standard of the
coinage is, beyond doubt, a measure which
should not be carelessly undertaken. Those
opposed to such a measure have stated that
the standard had remained unchanged in
this country for more than a century and a
half. Great weight has also been attributed
by some persons to the resolution of the
House of Commons of 20th October, 1696,
and passed again in the same words on the
12th June, 1822, 'That this House will not
alter the standard of the gold and silver
coins of this kingdom, in fineness, weight, or
denomination.' A solemn declaration beyond
doubt; but notwithstanding this, several
changes have at various times been made
in the currency of the realm.</p>

<p>In 1696, the year of the 'Resolution'
silver was the sole legal tender.</p>

<p>In 1717, silver ceased to be the sole standard,
and the double, or alternative standard
of gold or silver, was adopted. This change
was made under the advice of Sir Isaac
Newton.</p>

<p>In 1774, silver was restricted, as a legal
tender, to sums under &pound;25 by tale, and above
&pound;25 by weight, but gold remained a legal
tender without restriction.</p>

<p>In 1783, both gold and silver, without any
restriction, became legal tender.</p>

<p>In 1797, bank notes were made legal
tender. The effect of this change is well
known.</p>

<p>In 1798, silver was made legal tender as
in 1774.</p>

<p>In 1817, gold alone was made legal tender,
silver being debased and restricted as
mentioned before.</p>

<p>In the face of these alterations it is impossible
to appeal to history for a proof
that it is not lawful to make any desirable
change.</p>

<p>But some objectors say, If the British
Mint no longer coins gratis, gold bullion will
no longer make its way to this country as
freely as it now does. At the present time
England is the great bullion exchange of the
world, because it is the country where the
mint charges are lowest. Deprive this country
of this advantage, and the stream of
bullion will be directed elsewhere. If this
argument is of any validity, of course all, or
at least the greater part, of the bullion which
has already reached this country, must have
found its way to the Mint. But what is the
real fact? That not so much as the ninth
part of the gold bullion imported into this
country within the last four years, has been
coined into British money.</p>

<p>Looking at these figures, it will scarcely
be argued that the fact of gratuitous coinage
at the Royal Mint is of any power in attracting
gold bullion to this country.</p>

<p>The charges made on coining in other
countries amount to large sums in the aggregate.
It is desirable to show what these
sums are.</p>

<p>It has been calculated that, upon each

<p>It is of itself a sufficient answer to those
who think that the imposition of a seigniorage
might prevent bullion from being
brought to this country for coinage, to note
what has taken place where such a charge
is made. Both France and the United
States have coined considerably more gold
during the sixteen years mentioned above
than this country. Yet the charge in the
United States is nearly ten times that in
Great Britain. The coinage at the Mint of
Sydney has nearly doubled, yet the charge in
Sydney is nearly as high as in the United
States. The returns for the years 1867-1868
have not, as far as we are aware, yet reached
this country. But considering the great
and progressive increase in the Sydney
coinages, it is highly probable that the coins
struck in Australia during those years have
greatly exceeded those minted in London.</p>

<p>To sum up:</p>

<p>It is at present open to this country to
join the International Monetary Convention
already in force between several of the principal
European States.</p>

<p>It is probable that this Convention will
shortly include the most important powers
of the civilized world.</p>

<p>The population of the countries which
have already given in their adherence to this
Convention, greatly exceed in number the
inhabitants of the British Islands. Their
trade is more important in value than our
own.</p>

<p>The disadvantages of being outside such a
Convention are very great.</p>

<p>In joining it, a seigniorage would have to
be charged on all British gold coinages.</p>

<p>A similar seigniorage is always charged
on the coinages at the Sydney Mint; and
the coinage at the Sydney Mint is now large
and increasing&mdash;in the last two years probably
more than that of the English Mint.</p>

<p>This seigniorage is no disadvantage to
anyone. On the contrary, it possesses several
advantages. At present, the last holder
of a light sovereign is exposed to loss. This
is unfair, as probably the last holder has
done nothing to cause the coin to be light.</p>

<p>Were a seigniorage imposed, the first
holder, the man who thinks he can gain
something by causing the coin to be minted,
would have&mdash;as is fair&mdash;to provide against
the depreciation. Further, the first holder
would have to pay for the work he has done;
<i>i.e.</i>, the manufacture of the coin&mdash;a charge
now defrayed by the country.</p>

<p>It is clear that the absence of a seigniorage
is not the cause which attracts gold to England,
as barely the ninth part of the bullion
imported finds its way to the Mint.</p>

<p>It is also clear that alterations, one at
least of far more importance than the
imposition of a seigniorage, have at former
times been made in the status of the currency
of the country.</p>

<p>To conclude, in the words of an early
pioneer of British commerce, 'The exchanges
practised in England, and principally in
London, are confined within a narrow scantling,
being but as a rivolet issuing out of
the great streame of those exchanges that
are used beyond the seas.'</p>

<p>Thus wrote 'that eminently deserving
author,' Mr. Lewes Roberts, the 'delineator'
of the Merchant's Mappe of Commerce in
1638. The 'true dimensions of our English
traffique' even then excited his limited
admiration and wonder. He could only
imagine either that this commerce was 'at its
full perfection, or that it aymes higher than
can hitherto, by my weake sight, be either
seen or discerned.' To us, 'the full streame' of
that trade seems but 'a petty rivolet,' and we
only wonder how, with the complicated and
varying systems of money then in practice,
with measures of length and quantity differing
in almost every place of importance in
Europe, any commerce could be kept up
between differing nations.
It is no longer needful to note now, as it
was then, that different weights and measures
were to be found in the principal
cities even of the same country. It is no
longer needful to bear in mind, as it was
then, that there was a difference of exchange
between places close to each other, and
within the same territories. Commerce
now would not bear such fetters. The
vigour of the early days of trade surmounted
those obstacles as the rush of a mountain
stream drives it unhindered over rocks that
vainly bar its course. In these times affairs
approach what has been termed the stationary
state. As the stream expands, the
current becomes more gentle. As facilities
for trade become greater, a smaller obstacle
suffices to turn that trade from its course.
It is now far more easy to give a vessel the
option of discharging her cargo in one port
or another, in one country or another, than
it was then. Increased opportunities of
intercourse render any change of the line of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
traffic far less difficult now than at any
previous time. A smaller difference in
profit renders such alterations of destination
more desirable and more necessary. The
course of commerce has just been compared
to that of a stream&mdash;as dashing rapidly
down the mountain glen, or slowly moving
through the rich and level plain. Is it
permissible to carry on the simile still
further?&mdash;to watch how, as in Holland, a
trifling artificially-produced change of level
is sufficient to divert the scarcely perceptible
flow of the almost stagnant flood&mdash;to add
the waters of the Rhine to the Yssel, or of
the Waal to the Lech? So as a general extension
of wealth brings all countries more
closely to one uniform condition, is it not
needful to remove those obstacles which
may cause similar diversions of our trade?
Is it not needful to take a step onward, and
to supply our own people with those advantages
which are now possessed by many&mdash;will
soon be possessed by almost all civilized
nations? Among such advantages, to provide
a coinage which, while entailing no
expense on the country, either at its creation
or for its maintenance, may be truly international
in character, and aid the streams of
our commerce to maintain their course
around the globe.</p>

<p class="p2">From 1745 to 1820&mdash;this was the lifetime
of James Harris, afterwards first Earl of
Malmesbury; and such is the period over
which the subject-matter of these two works
extends. A more memorable period is not
to be found in the annals of this country, or
even in the long and more momentous history
of Europe. It bridges the chasm which
separates the old world of Europe from the
new. It shows us that elder world in its last
stage; it also shows us the beginning of that
new and better order of things amongst which
we now live. In the earlier period of those
seventy-five years, we see the thrones of
Louis the Fifteenth, of Frederick the Great,
and Catherine of Russia, standing high above
the heads of a crushed and miserable people,
who counted for nothing either in their policy
or in their pleasures. The simple facts of
that old <i>r&eacute;gime</i> of royal absolutism now
read like a monstrous dream. Vice and
despotism in the palace, license and intrigue
at the Court, penury in the cottage, and degradation
everywhere, such is hardly an
exaggeration of the general condition of the
Continent at that time, and simple truth as
regards France, who then, as since, boasted
her leadership of civilization. As is always
the case in analogous periods, the people
themselves had sunk into a moral torpor.
There were no national movements or
aspirations. Religion, freedom, and the
thirst for military conquest, are the three
great motive powers of humanity. But all
of these were then dead or in abeyance.
Humanity had settled on its lees. Even
mental philosophy, which so often flourishes
in such dead times of a nation's history,
threw its teachings into the scale in favour of
an ignoble life; and while a pitiless Scepticism
robbed men of heaven and all their
religious beliefs, Materialism bade them "eat,
drink, and be merry, for to-morrow ye die"
<i>for ever</i>, like the trees of the wood and the
beasts of the fields. While Philosophy
robbed man of his moral freedom and a future
life, Royalty denied him his personal and
political liberty and plundered his pockets.
In truth, the whole upper crust of society
had become heartless, debased, and corrupt,
while beneath was a seething mass of suffering,
ignorance, and savagery. And so the
upper crust, with king, priests, and nobles&mdash;crowns,
croziers, and coronets&mdash;gave way and
fell into an abyss of devouring fire, like that
which burst up of yore beneath Sodom and
Gomorrah, devastating the corrupt Cities of
the Plain. The old world of Europe was
cast into the furnace, and all things became
new&mdash;Providence overruling the wrath of
man to its own wise and merciful ends.</p>

<p>All history is an ennobling study, alike in
its events and its examples; but life is short,
and it is the French Revolution that commences
the period of history of deepest
importance to the present age. Beyond that
chasm, so rudely severing the old world of
Europe from the new, lies the realm of the
historian; on this side begins a drama of
opinions and events constituting by far the
most useful field of study in secular and
political knowledge. Changed since then,
and still changing, as are the territorial
arrangements of Europe, the conquests of
Napoleon contributed greatly to the rise of
the principle of Nationality which is now
the great power at work in the alteration of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
boundaries and the shaping of kingdoms.
It is true, Napoleon meant to conquer only
for himself and for France. He sought to
found a vast empire, with vassal kingdoms
under the rule of his brothers and relatives.
But in establishing this empire, he swept
away a great deal of the obstructive rubbish
of the former time. By expelling the Germans
from Italy, and also by creating a titular
King of Rome, he paved the way for the
subsequent aspirations and movement of the
Italians in favour of nationality and independence,
which have at length borne their full
fruits in the establishment of a free and
united Italy. In like manner, by sweeping
away a whole host of petty princedoms in
Germany, he simplified the subsequent
course of events towards a unification of
Germany; while the iron despotism which
he exercised in that country first compelled
all Germans to feel the tie of brotherhood,
in the glorious uprising of the Fatherland in
1813 against the foreign foe. Poland, too,
during the ascendancy of Napoleon, temporarily
(but only for the great conqueror's own
purposes) regained in part its old existence,
thereby keeping alive the hope for renewed
independence; a hope which, improbable as
our expectations may seem, we think will
yet be realized amid the great trouble, and
changes impending over the Continent. But
still more memorable, and worthy of thoughtful
study, are the times of the French Revolution,
from the influence which they have
produced upon the current of political, social,
and religious thought, in subsequent times.
A whole flood of new ideas, principles, and
opinions was then poured upon the world.
Some of these were wise and good, others
were detestable, but nearly all of them were
given to the world in so crude a form and in
so savage or ruthless a spirit, as to make
them as a whole so repulsive that even yet
some of their excellencies are but little known
or acknowledged. Every one recognises, however,
the vast influence which that grand and
terrible Revolution has exercised upon the
whole current of subsequent thought; and if
Europe has yet to undergo one more great
upheaving of democratic revolution (as we
believe it has), we may rely upon it that
some of the more extreme and, at present, all
but forgotten dogmas of the first revolution
will again appear on the scene; including, we
regret to say, that terrible development of infidelity
and materialism, against which even
Robespierre himself, with his firm belief in the
Supreme Being and a future life, was unable
successfully to contend. That storm of blasphemy
and utter scepticism, in its worst features
at least, soon blew over&mdash;and let us trust
that such will be the case again; but any one
who has watched the turn of thought on the
Continent, and in Germany even more than
in France, must expect any new outburst of democratic
revolution to be accompanied by
a manifesto of infidelity and an attempt to
banish religion from the fabric and principles
of society, in a manner only too similar to
that which formed the worst feature of the
first French Revolution.</p>

<p>The first Earl of Malmesbury was in public
life, for the greater part of the time holding
the highest diplomatic appointments
abroad, during the whole course of these momentous
events. From a vantage-ground
enjoyed by few men either of this or any
other country, he beheld the Courts and
peoples of Europe both before the deluge
and after it; and although he withdrew from
public office before the termination of the
great war with France, he continued to the
end to be confidentially consulted by the
Ministers of the time. The first of the two
works whose titles are prefixed is by far the
most valuable and important. All the leading
men of the day&mdash;monarchs, statesmen,
and generals&mdash;figure constantly in the diaries
and correspondence. The work has been
quoted with advantage to history by some of
our ablest writers, and not least so by Lord
Stanhope, in his 'Life of Pitt.' It constitutes
a mine of historical and political facts; and
though published too late to be made use of
by our chief historians of the French war
and of the immediately preceding times of
the Empress Catherine and Frederick the
Great, its value is fully recognised by the
writers of the personal and political memoirs
which have recently issued from the press.
The second of the works on our list is of a
lighter character, in which the incidents of
fashionable life mingle largely with matters
of State and Parliamentary politics. The
one work shows us the grand movements of
the time, the other gives us the bye-play.
The latter, to which we chiefly confine our
remarks, is a selection from private letters
received by three generations of the Harris
family. They are confidential exchanges of
intelligence and ideas, in which the hopes and
fears, the expectations, disappointments, and
impressions of our ancestors are given in the
very words in which they were described.
The noble editor of these letters calls them
'waifs of the past,' but they possess a twofold
interest, firstly, as illustrating the opinions
and social habits of that past time; and
secondly, they are reliable indications of
what public feeling was at their date with
regard to politics, society, and the general
condition of our own and foreign countries:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'And how eventful those years were,' says
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
the editor: 'They saw the Highland rebellion;
the American war; the despotic Courts of the
Bourbons, of Catherine, and of Frederick; the
great French revolution, and its subsequent
phases of a bloody republic, an aggressive empire,
an ephemeral restoration, and again of a
short empire and a second restoration. They
witnessed the struggles of our English people
for greater freedom, even from the privileges
claimed by their own House of Commons; and
lastly, a far fiercer contest to save their own
country from the subjugation under which for
a time Napoleon held every nation in Europe
except theirs.'</p>
</div>

<p>The chief recipient of the earlier letters in
this collection was Mr. James Harris, the father
of the first Earl of Malmesbury. The
Harris family had lived quietly on an estate
in Wiltshire from the middle of the 16th
century; and Mr. James Harris first broke
through the hereditary sameness of existence
by becoming one of the most distinguished
scholars of his day. Besides 'Philosophical
Treatises,' he published a work on grammar,
called 'Hermes,' which the accomplished
Bishop Lowth styled 'the most beautiful example
of analysis produced since the days of
Aristotle,' and which obtained so high a reputation
that it was afterwards translated and
published by command of the French Directory
in 1796. He was member of Parliament
for Christchurch, which seat he held till his
death, in 1780; was made a Lord of the
Treasury in 1763, and in 1744 he became
Secretary and Comptroller of the Queen's
Household. When he first took his seat in
the House of Commons, John Townshend
asked who he was, and on being told that
he had written on grammar and harmony,
replied 'Why does he come here, where he
will hear neither?' His literary talent and
high personal character procured for Mr.
Harris a wide circle of friends and acquaintances
among the leading men of the times;
and owing to the influence he thus acquired
he was enabled to launch his son, afterwards
the first Lord, early into public life. The
present Earl (who edits these letters), speaking
of the '<i>f&ecirc;tes</i> and social intercourse in the
venerable city of Sarum,' where his great-grandfather
resided, observes regretfully
'how much less of cliques and class categories
then existed among the nobility and
their neighbours than in the present day.'</p>

<p>Mr. Harris was passionately fond of music
and art, and wrote treatises upon them, which
indicate a more lively and sympathetic nature
than would he inferred from the dry philosophy
of his other works. His wife moved
much in society, and appears to have possessed
a similar taste for the fine arts. The
best artists of the day were visitors at their
house in Salisbury. The family went frequently
to the theatre, and in the letters we
find critical observations on most of the new
dramas of the time. There are two letters
from David Garrick, asking permission to
bring out at Drury Lane a musical pastoral,
called 'Damo and Amyrillis,' which, the
editor says, 'was in Mr. Harris's hands,' but
which, there seems to us reason to believe,
was actually composed by him. As might
be expected of a musical family, they attended
the concerts and the opera, and by-and-by
we read of 'the great house in the
Haymarket,' and Italian singers come to the
front. Then, as now, the Opera was a perilous
venture, and both the managers and
singers occasionally came to grief. Of one
of the favourite singers of the day we read
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'All Manzolini's clothes and finery are seized,
and carried to the Custom House, so he has
sent a petition to the Lords of the Treasury to
have them redeemed. This event diverts Lord
North, as he says not one of the Treasury
know a note of music, nor care one farthing
what becomes of Manzolini, <i>except Mr. Harris</i>.
He says your father has told so moving a story
to Mr. Grenville about it, that he thinks it may
affect him.'</p>
</div>

<p>A close friendship existed between Mr.
Harris and Handel, who left him, by will,
his portrait, and all his operas in manuscript.
The very first letter in this collection
has a touching allusion to the great musician,
whose intellect had been affected by
his labours, and who had become very eccentric.
The Countess of Salisbury, a relative
of Mr. Harris, writes to him thus (in 1745):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'My constancy to poor Handel got the better
of my indolence and my propensity to stay at
home, and I went last Friday to see the 'Alexander's
Feast;' but it was such a melancholy
pleasure as drew tears of sorrow, great though
unhappy Handel, dejected, wan, and dark, sitting
by, not playing on the harpsichord, and
to think how his light has been spent by being
<i>overplied in music's cause</i>. I was sorry, too,
to find the audience so insipid and tasteless (I
may add unkind) as not to give the poor man
the comfort of applause; but affectation and
conceit cannot discern or attend to merit.'</p>
</div>

<p>In the next letter, the Rev. W. Harris
writes to Mrs. Harris thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'I met Mr. Handel a few days since in the
street, and stopped and put him in mind who
I was; upon which, I am sure it would have
diverted you to have seen his antic motions.
He seemed highly pleased, and was full of inquiry
after you. I told him I was very confident
that you expected a visit from him this
summer (at Salisbury). He talked much of
his precarious state of health, yet he looks well
enough.'</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span></p>

<p>Handel recovered from the mental affection;
and five years later (1750) we find the
Earl of Shaftesbury writing of him as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'I have seen Handel several times since I
came hither (to London), and I think I never
saw him so cool and well. He is quite easy
in his behaviour, and has been pleasing himself
in the purchase of several fine pictures,
particularly a large Rembrandt, which is indeed
excellent. We have scarce talked at all about
musical subjects, though enough to find that
his performances will go off incomparably.'</p>
</div>

<p>Music appears to have held a more prominent
place in public amusements a century
ago than is generally imagined; and
when Giardini undertook the management
of the Opera 'at the great house in the Haymarket'
in 1764, Mrs. Harris opines that he
will meet with no small difficulty, because
the 'greatest part of the orchestra, and almost
all the dancers, are engaged at the
<i>play-houses</i>.' Giardini&mdash;a Piedmontese violinist
and composer, who, after residing
thirty years in England, went to Russia,
where he died in 1793&mdash;came to grief in
this operatic venture, and afterwards started
an Opera in 'Mrs. Cornely's' rooms. Indeed,
the Haymarket house, great as its celebrity
became in the present century, was by no
means a famous place in those times. In
the same year (1764) we read in one of the
letters, 'Almack is going to build some
most magnificent rooms behind his house&mdash;one
much larger than that at Carlisle
House,' <i>i.e.</i>, Mrs. Cornely's. This latter was
the favourite place of resort at that time, and
for many years afterwards. It was a place
where subscription-concerts were held (one
series mentioned in 1764, consisted of
twenty-one concerts, of Bach's music,
Cocchi's, and Abel's, for five guineas),
where the Opera for some time had its seat;
and also where masquerade parties and
other fashionable entertainments were held.
In 1770, we read of 'fifteen or sixteen
young men of fashion and fortune giving a
masquerade at Cornely's, to 800 people;'
and in the following year we have a full account
of a masquerade given at the same
place by 'the gentlemen of the Tuesday
Nights' Club.' Mrs. Harris, writing to her
son (the future Earl) at Madrid, says: 'Mr.
Charles Fox has offered to supply us with
tickets. Your sisters and I mean to go; 'tis
the only masquerade I wish them to go to.
I shall try my utmost to persuade Mr. Harris
(her husband) to accompany us. One
difficulty is in the way; that is, no gentlemen
are admitted in dominos.' Mr. Harris
could not be persuaded to join the fashionable
assembly, but Mr. Fox&mdash;who had just
commenced his official career, as a Lord of
the Admiralty&mdash;was, at that time, more at
home in such parties than in Parliament.
Mrs. Harris was greatly delighted with it.
The following is part of her account of it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'Gertrude (Miss Harris) was dressed as the
Pythian, that is, priestess to the temple of
Apollo, a dress which she wore in one of the
private plays. Louisa was an Indian Princess;
Mr. Cambridge borrowed a dress for her which
was pretty and fine&mdash;the habit, muslin with
green and gold sprigs, with a turban and veil.
I never saw anybody enter so strongly into the
spirit of a masquerade as she did. She talked
to numbers all in French, and had disguised
her voice so well that even some of her friends
did not discover her. Towards the end, she
said she was frightened by the Devil speaking
to her sister. Mine was a white domino, with
a Mary Queen of Scots cap and ruff.</p>

<p>'Lord Edgecombe was a shepherdess, with a
little lamb under his arm, and a most excellent
figure he was. Mr. Banbury was a most excellent
<i>friseur</i>; Lord Berkeley, a charlatan.
Mrs. Crewe<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> looked beautiful as a nun with a
yellow veil. Several gentlemen in women's
clothes, not as old women....</p>

<p>'On the whole we are greatly entertained,
for it was the first masked ball I ever saw.
We supped soon after one; and then everybody
unmasked, and a number of acquaintances
we found, though we had found out many before.
We got home soon after five; and, old
as I may be, I never left a public place with
more regret.'</p>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Cornely's rooms soon became the object
of a jealous, and let us hope unfounded,
attack. Giardini had opened an Opera
there, which was 'greatly injuring that of
Mr. Hobart's in the Haymarket;' and the
latter gentleman 'informed against them' as
an unlicensed house. There was a strong
party on either side, 'harmoniacs' and 'anti-harmoniacs,'
and the latter party brought
forward scandalous charges. Only a week
after the above-mentioned masquerade, Mrs.
Harris writes thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'The Harmoniac is over, and, what is worse,
they threaten hard to indict Mrs. Cornely's as
a house of ill-fame, and say that forty beds are
made and unmade every day, which is hard,
for a friend of ours says it is never more than
<i>twenty</i>. But, joking apart, if they choose to
demolish Mrs. Cornely, all elegance and spectacle
will end in this town; for she never yet
had her equal in these things, and I believe got
but little, as all she undertakes is clever to a
degree.'</p>
</div>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<p>There is a wonderful want of logical sequence
in these few lines; and as to whether
the scandalous charge was true or false, Mrs.
Harris apparently was as little in a position
to judge as we are now. Mrs. Cornely was
originally Mademoiselle Pompeiati, a singer.
She hired Carlisle House, in Soho-square,
and established balls and assemblies by subscription.
This place of fashionable resort,
however, as well as its mistress, quickly
thereafter declined in reputation. In 1774,
we find Mrs. Harris writing:&mdash;'I went to
Carlysle House, which Bach has taken for
his concerts; the furniture, like Mrs. Cornely,
is much on the decline; but, in my opinion,
the place is better for the concert than Almack's.'
Bach soon left these rooms, and
opened a place of his own, splendidly fitted
up. But even he was not allowed to carry
on his performances without opposition, although
of a different kind from that which
proved fatal to Mrs. Cornely. 'Lord Hillsborough,
Sir James Porter, and some others
(writes Mrs. Harris) have entered into a subscription
to prosecute Bach for a nuisance,
and I was told the jury had found a bill
against him. One would scarce imagine his
house could molest either of these men, for
Bach's is at the corner of Hanover-street.'</p>

<p>Amateur theatrical performances were in
those days in great vogue among the upper
classes, and usually took place in the country
residences of the nobility and gentry in
the winter months&mdash;during the Parliamentary
recess, when even members of the Ministry
(notably Mr. Fox) took part in them.
Winterslow House was the famous place for
these amateur performances. The ordinary
audience consisted of the servants of the
house and the neighbouring townspeople, as
well as a select circle of visitors, which on
one occasion included the Duke and Duchess
of Queensberry, the Duchess of Bedford,
Lord and Lady Pembroke, Lady Charles
and Lord Robert Spencer, Lord Dunkellin,
Lady Louisa Fitzpatrick, &amp;c. At the close
of one of those performances at Winterslow
House (in January, 1774), in which Mr. Fox
and another member of his family acted, a
lamentable accident occurred, which destroyed
the greater part of the mansion.
Mrs. Harris writes of it next day as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'We got home in whole bones [an allusion
apparently to the bad roads] soon after one,
and in high spirits; but our joy is now
turned to sorrow, for this morning, at five,
a fire broke out in the new building at Winterslow
House, and entirely consumed that and
also the old house, except the kitchen and
laundry. Though the house was full of company,
fortunately no life was lost. The fire
was discovered by some Salisbury chairmen,
who, for want of a bed, were deposited on a
carpet under the great stairs; they alarmed the
house, and probably, thereby, saved some lives.
Lady Pembroke, Lady Mary Fox and her children,
were carried to King's House; Miss Herbert,
Mrs. Hodges, and the other ladies stayed
in the laundry; all the gentlemen stood by.
As they had no engines, and little or no water
but violent rain, they in a manner gave up all
hopes of the house; but their object was to
save the furniture, in which they have succeeded,
though 'tis greatly damaged by dirt and
rain. 'Tis thought, but not certain, that the
fire was owing to some timber near a chimney
in the new building. I think of the contrast:
we left that house this morning between twelve
and one, all mirth and jollity, and by seven it
was consumed; it really hurts me when I
think how many agreeable days I have spent
in those rooms.</p>

<p>'Some say that, during the flames, Stephen
and Charles Fox and Fitzpatrick got to a proper
distance, and laid bets as to which beam
would fall in first. The friends of the house,
who resort to Almack's and White's, say they
are sorry they were not at Winterslow that
night, as "they might have had an opportunity
of seeing the family in a <i>new light</i>. I could
mention profane things uttered at the very
time, but they are too bad."</p>
</div>

<p>Amateur dramatic and operatic performances
were a frequent amusement at
Mr. Harris's house in Salisbury. Miss Gertrude,
the elder daughter, was an adept in
such performances, and, moreover, retained
this taste throughout the whole of her long
life. This lady afterwards became the wife
of Mr. Robinson, younger son of Lord
Grantham. She lived, in the London world,
to the age of eighty-five, preserving to the
last her faculties and cheerful character.
She used to give private theatricals at her
house, in which Lord de Grey, Mr. F.
Robinson, Hugh Elliott, and Canning were
the chief actors&mdash;Canning writing the prologues
and epilogues, which are still extant.
In the letters we find frequent allusions to
the performances in Mr. Harris's family residence;
but we shall content ourselves with
mentioning one of them, which aroused the
satirical ire of some provincial Juvenal, whose
poetic outburst serves to show the great,
indeed too great, change between the notions
on such subjects then and now. Mrs. Harris,
in a letter to her son, thus alludes to a rehearsal
of the piece, which a few days
afterwards was performed, as usual, to an
audience of the townsfolk and the visitors at
the house:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'I have but little to send from hence; we
are so totally taken up with our own theatrical
business that nothing else is thought of. The
ladies acted last night in their dresses to all their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
servants, and a most crowded house they had.
Although I was not admitted to the performance,
I saw all the ladies. Their dresses are fine and
elegant. Miss Townshend makes an excellent
Spanish ambassador, a fine figure and richly
dressed; she had a prodigious long sword, and
not being accustomed to wear one, she contrived,
as she walked, to run it up through a scene, and
damaged it greatly. Louisa has taken a sword
you left her [here?], and manages it right well.
She is very fine in a purple Spanish dress, all
the buttons Irish diamonds, a handsome button
and loop to her hat, and your King of Spain's
picture hanging from her neck. The Queen,
Miss Hussey, was dressed in blue and silver,
with a number of diamonds; Miss Wyndham,
who is Elvira, in white, trimmed with pearls;
Gertrude, the Princess, in a black Spanish dress,
trimmed with red and silver, and a great
quantity of diamonds; it becomes her much.</p>

<p>'Lord Pembroke [the tenth Earl] sent a note
to your father, which was as follows:&mdash;"I can
snuff candles, I can scrape on the violoncello;
if either of these sciences will entitle me to a
place in your theatre, I will perform gratis.
P.S. My wife says she can thrum the harpsichord
or viol-de-gamba."</p>

<p>'We have sent them and the Amesbury
House tickets for Saturday. Everybody is
making interest to get in. The ladies mean to
perform five times, so I hope everybody will
see it.'</p>
</div>
<p>The satirical verses which this lady performance
called forth appeared in the <i>Bath
Journal</i> (Nov. 17, 1774), entitled 'On the
Ladies at the Close of Salisbury, now acting
<i>Elvira</i>;' and Mrs. Harris opines that 'they
were sent from some <i>vinegar</i> merchant in
Salisbury who could not get admitted to the
performance. The verses are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'In good Queen Elizabeth's reign,</p>
<p class="i1">In a decent and virtuous age,</p>
<p>That they ne'er might give modesty pain,</p>
<p class="i1">No female appeared on the stage.</p>
<p>But lo, what a change time affords!</p>
<p class="i1">The ladies, 'mong many strange things,</p>
<p>Call for helmets, for breeches and swords,</p>
<p class="i1">And act Senators, Hervos, and Kings.'</p>
</div>

<p>If the anonymous 'vinegar merchant' could
have been transported into the present time,
how much more would he have been shocked
by the 'change which time affords!' Could
he now take a trip to London (so serious a
matter a century ago, but made so quickly
and cheaply now by means of a return ticket
by rail), what would he think of the state of
matters in our theatres? It was only in
private theatricals that ladies donned the
male costume a century ago, and they were
always draped with the strictest propriety.
But what do we see in London theatres now?
Not only in the so-called 'burlesques' does
the main 'fun,' such as it is, consist in the
transposition of the sexes&mdash;men taking
female characters, and women the part of
males&mdash;but the costumes of the female performers,
rich and picturesque as they usually
are, are devised expressly to make a prodigal
display of the person, a minimum of clothes
apparently being the acme of perfection kept
in view by the theatrical costumiers, and by
the ladies themselves. The female figure is
now so prodigally displayed that a handsome
girl, especially if she has well-turned legs, is
sought after on that account alone. 'My
<i>shape</i> is my fortune, sir, she said!' would
now be the burden of the song of these demi-nude
demoiselles of the stage. To such a
pitch has this new method of attracting audiences
been carried, that this class of performances,
or rather exhibitions, are now
known in theatrical parlance as 'leg-pieces.'
It is impossible not to see what a demoralising
influence such performances must have
upon the rising generation, indeed upon the
whole audience. It is a lamentable sign of
the times: it is a symptom of degeneration,
of corruption, of a fatal laxity of manners.
The relation between the sexes is becoming
seriously deteriorated; and woman, instead
of being peculiarly an object of respectful
regard or chivalrous admiration, tends to
become simply an object of pleasure, seeking
to please at any cost. Most rightly did the
Lord Chamberlain recently issue his fiat
against the short skirts of the ballet-dancers:
but the fiat has been vain, as all such injunctions
in this 'free' country must be when
public opinion refuses to support it, or at
last allows itself to be overpowered by the
crowd of playgoers who delight in such
spectacles. A gangrene of selfish and demoralising
pleasure is now eating into the
heart of this country; and we fear the social
malady will not be checked save by the advent
of some terrible national calamity&mdash;let
us hope not so terrible as that by which our
neighbour France is now being purged as by
fire.</p>

<p>Before quitting the lighter and gossipy
items to be found in these letters, let us say
a word or two about the rich Court costumes
of the period. We need not speak of the
dresses of the ladies; for although the fashion
of those dresses has changed, indeed is ceaselessly
changing, in richness and costliness
female attire at the present time is quite on
a par with what it was when George the
Second was king. But a notable change has
taken place in the full dress of the men.
Probably only a minority of our readers can
remember the time when colour disappeared
from the evening costume of gentlemen: it
is nearly forty years since coloured coats,
with white or coloured silk or velvet waistcoats
vanished from the private dinner-party
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
and ball-room&mdash;though the taste for colour
is now reviving. Warren, in <i>Ten Thousand
a Year</i>, dresses his hero Gammon for the
evening in blue coat with metal buttons,
white waistcoat, and black trousers&mdash;and
such was a quiet evening dress of that time.
In the long interval since then, there has
been a monotonous reign of simple black
cloth. The change in the Court or gala dress
has been still more striking. Apropos of
this change, a philosophic writer has remarked,
that whenever any class abandons
its distinctive costume, it is a sign of decadence
and coming extinction. There is
some truth in the remark, but it is partial
truth only. It ignores the fact that the
peculiar source of distinction for each class,
and especially with the nobility, who are or
ought to be the leaders of the nation, varies
from age to age with the spirit of the times.
It might as well be said that our nobility
verged on extinction three centuries ago,
when they ceased to wear mail and to lead
their retainers to the field. No doubt the
French Revolution, with its levelling doctrines,
and the principle of social equality
(not new in this country), tended to abolish
the 'bravery' of dress previously distinctive
of the nobility; but the change was far more
due to the gravity of the times, the sober
spirit natural during a most critical period of
the country, and of the economy rendered
necessary throughout the community at large
by the heavy costs of the great war with
France. Indeed, the fact that a corresponding
change took place in the gala dress of
the middle classes serves to show that there
was nothing exceptional or peculiar in the
diminished finery of the aristocratic costume.
All classes alike felt the sobering influence
of the time, and then, as in all such cases, a
corresponding change took place in costume.</p>

<p>Firstly, then, as to the gala costume of the
Prince of Wales, afterwards George III.,
who certainly cannot be suspected of too
great a devotion to fashion or the frivolities
of dress. In a Drawing-room in St. James's
in 1745, the Prince of Wales wore a light-blue
velvet coat, laced with silver, and the
sleeves of it brocade&mdash;as was also his waistcoat.
On another occasion he 'had on a
crimson damask laced with silver, very rich
and handsome.' Again, the Countess of
Shaftesbury, writing to her cousin, Mr.
Harris, in December, 1754, 'enlivening her
epistle with a detail of the birthday finery'
at Court, says: 'The Prince of Wales looked
as blooming as his clothes; they were a
blossom-coloured velvet, with gold and lace
down before; the waistcoat and cuffs a
rich white-and-gold stuff. Prince Edward's
was a yellow and silver velvet, with a silver
lace before, turned up with white and silver
cuffs, and the waistcoat the same.' She
adds: 'My lord's clothes and mine were both
admired. His was a very rich scarlet and
gold velvet coat&mdash;waistcoat and breeches
the same; and mine a gold stuff with purple
spots on the ground, and coloured sprigs of
flowers that looked like embroidery.' On
a similar occasion, 'Lord Kildare was unexceptionably
the finest of any gentleman
there: his coat was a light-blue silk, embroidered
all over with gold and silver in a
very curious manner, turned up with white
satin, embroidered as the other; the waistcoat
the same as his sleeves.' His Majesty
(George II.), however, by no means set the
fashion in gala dress. Even at Drawing-rooms,
we read, 'he dressed in his usual
way, without aiming at finery of any sort;'
his usual costume being a deep-blue cloth
coat, trimmed with silver lace, and waistcoat
the same. At another Birthday Drawing-room,
'the King was dressed in black velvet;
the sleeves of his coat and his waistcoat
were red, embroidered with gold.' The last
time his Majesty's costume at Drawing-rooms
is mentioned is in 1754, six years before his
death, when we find the following curious
statement, that 'his Majesty had told Mr.
Shutz [the fashionable German tailor of the
day] he would have him bespeak him a very
handsome suit, but not to make a boy or a
fop of him;' and as the result of this consultation
with his tailor, his Majesty appeared
in brown, very richly laced with silver, and
turned up with a blue cuff laced, and a blue
and silver waistcoat.' We read of 'very
mortifying disasters' happening at some of
these Birthday Drawing-rooms. On one
such occasion, the Countess of Salisbury
writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'Miss Young, in making her curtsey to his
Majesty, entangled the heel of her shoe [there
were high heels in those days] in her train, so
that she fell quite backwards, with her legs
up. The laugh was so general that nobody
thought of helping the poor young creature,
until his Majesty, though as well diverted as
the rest, said he would go himself; but, as you
may imagine, was prevented. Lady Young was
not in less confusion than her daughter.</p>

<p>'The second hustle was about Miss Corke,
whose hoop, in climbing over the Foreigner's
box, caught in such a manner that all her petticoats
flew up, to the undermost flannel. Lady
Arvon, in endeavouring to help her, was
caught in the hoop, which pulled off her fine
diamond sprig and head-dress.'
</p></div>

<p>As might be expected, there were flirtations,
runaway matches, and <i>m&eacute;salliances</i>
in those days, as they are still. One of the
beauties immortalized by the pencil of Sir
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
Joshua Reynolds, and whose portrait is preserved
at Holland House, gave rise to much
gossip by marrying a 'player:'&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'The Court and assembly's talk yesterday
was all of the match of Lady Susan Strangeways
and O'Brien, the player. It is said she went
out on Saturday with a servant, whom, under
pretext of having forgotten something, she sent
back, and said she would wait in the street till
her return. O'Brien was waiting in a hackney
coach, which she got into; and they went to
Covent Garden Church, and were married.
'Tis a most surprising event, as Lady Susan
was everything that was good and amiable;
and how she ever got acquainted with this
man is not to be accounted for. They say she
sent him &pound;200 a little time since. She is of
age.'</p></div>

<p>Gretna Green, on the Scottish borders, although
it has now relapsed into the obscurity
natural to such a poor little hamlet (although
it still gives name to a railway station),
was a famous place in those days in
connection with runaway matches; indeed, it
was so even within the memory of the present
generation. A century ago, we often read
of lovers having 'gone to Scotland.' Among
others&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'Lady Jane Tollemache, daughter to Lord
Dysart, is gone to Scotland with a Captain
Halliday of the Light Horse: his father is a
man of fortune. The captain was just going to
to be married to Miss Byron; the coach and
clothes were bought; but he saw Lady Jane
twice at the Richmond assembly, was captivated,
wrote a letter to Miss Byron, to inform her
he had changed his mind, and had set out for
Scotland.' [The gay captain would have had
to pay heavy damages for so cavalier a proceeding
now-a-days.]</p>
</div>

<p>Whatever amount of what is commonly
called 'scandal,' and which merits a worse
name, there may have been in our aristocratic
circles in the latter half of last century,
there is but little trace of it to be found in
these letters. But in one of Mrs. Harris's
letters to her son, giving him the talk and
gossip of the town, there is a mysterious-looking
allusion to some such matrimonial
scandal, which reads as follows:&mdash;'Lady
S&mdash;&mdash; B&mdash;&mdash; is in lodgings at Knightsbridge.
She says her husband [whom doubtless she
had deserted] is a most angelic man; but her
attachment for the other is so great, she
must live with him.'</p>

<p>What was the 'Pantheon' in those days?
Whatever else it was, it appears to have
been a sort of assembly-rooms for balls and
dances; and, though frequented by persons
of rank and of the highest respectability, its
doors were not impregnable against the entrance
of 'soiled doves' and doubtful reputations&mdash;whose
presence, however, was
against the rules of the place, for, as the
following embarrassing incident to one of
Mrs. Harris's daughters shows, they were liable
to be turned out. Mrs. Harris thus
writes of it to her son:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'Wednesday your two sisters, Molly Cambridge,
and I, went to the Pantheon. It is undoubtedly
the finest and most complete thing
ever seen in England. Such mixture of company
never assembled before under the same
roof. Lord Mansfield, Mrs. Baddeley, Lord
Chief Baron Parker, Mrs. Abbingdon, Sir
James Porter, Madlle. Heinell, Lords Hyde
and Camden, with many other serious men,
and most of the gay ladies in town, and ladies
of the best rank and character&mdash;and, by appearance,
some very low people. Louisa is
thought very like Mrs. Baddeley [one of the
gay ladies]; and Gertrude and I had our doubts
whether our characters might not suffer by
walking with her [<i>i.e.</i>, Louisa]; but had they
offered to turn her out, we depended upon Mr.
Hanger's protection. [George Hanger, of the
Guards, was one of the great beaux of his
day.] None of the fashion dance country-dances
or minuets in the great room, though
there were a number of minuets and a large
set of dancers. I saw Miss Wilks dance a
minuet; some young ladies danced cotillons in
the cotillon gallery.... The spectacle
at first strikes one greatly, but then it becomes
stupid.'</p>
</div>

<p>The domain of personal incident crops up
richly and interestingly throughout these
volumes, and comes freshly and truthfully
upon us in the correspondence of the hour.
Whether we read of Lady &mdash;&mdash;, who ran
away with her footman John, and sent back
her fine clothes, 'because she would no longer
have any need for them;' or of the deep
gambling and other queer affairs of Charles
Fox in his dissipated youth; or of the sayings
and doings of the notorious Wilkes,
who so shocked society, or of his duel, in
which he bore himself so honourably, the
epistolary narrative is full of <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> and interest.
The second marriage of Lord Coventry
(whose first wife was the elder of the
beautiful Miss Gunnings) must have been
what is now called 'good fun.' The marriage
party was all assembled in stately magnificence;
but his Grace of Canterbury was
from home, and the licence did not arrive!
But the party was equal to the emergency&mdash;'so
it was agreed that they should eat the
dinner, rather than it should be spoiled. So
to dinner they went [at the early hour then
in fashion], and sat all the afternoon, dressed
in their white and silver, expecting every
moment the express from Lambeth, but nothing
came. The same reason held good
for eating a supper as for eating the dinner;
and in short they supped and sat till after
two, and then, by mutual consent, dismissed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
the parson, and all retired.' Two hours afterwards
(4 a.m.) the express with the licence
arrived, and the ceremony went off
with due <i>&eacute;clat</i> in the forenoon. We may
remark that it is comforting to find in these
letters of the day a guarantee for the genuineness
of many of the excellent bonmots
and repartees which have taken their place
in our anecdotical literature in connection
with the more or less famous men of that
period, and which sparkle pleasantly across
the pages of these volumes.</p>

<p>But quitting the domain of purely personal
incident, let us glance at some passages
in the letters which throw curious light
upon the England of our forefathers in the
latter half of the eighteenth century. Here
is a picture of Cambridgeshire which looks
strange now, and which indeed startled the
writer thereof, Mrs. Harris, when she and
her husband went on a visit to their friend
the Dean of Sarum's parsonage in that locality.
She says that the country is the
most disagreeable she ever saw; and talking
of the Fens, says that the herds of cattle
which feed on them in the summer months
are up to their bellies in water even in the
dry season:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'The natives dry the cowdung for firing in
the winter; so 'tis kept in heaps about the
fields, as is also the dung of their yards; so
when you walk, the stink is inconceivable.
Mr. Harris took a ride to survey these fens,
and he says nothing can be so detestable. He
talked with the natives, who told him that during
the winter the water was constantly above
the ancles in their houses.'</p>

<p>'The Dean's parsonage is surrounded with
fens, and you are teased beyond expression by
the gnats. When we got here, the Dean's
butler came to your father with a pair of
leather stockings [the dress of that day was
breeches and silk stockings] to draw on so as
to protect his legs, which in hot weather [it
was the month of June] is dreadful. Besides
this, the beds have a machine covered with a
silk net, which lets down after you are in bed,
and covers you all over. Without this, there
could be no sleeping; for, notwithstanding
these precautions, we were most miserably
stung.'</p>
</div>

<p>Were anyone to light upon this passage
in an isolated form nowadays, he would conclude
without hesitation that it was an extract
from some Indian diary&mdash;the use of
the word 'natives' completing the resemblance.
Here we have the Indian plague of
mosquitoes existing in full severity in England,
and also the use of mosquito-nets
around the beds at night, exactly as in India.
Nay, there is still another point of resemblance&mdash;namely,
in the use which the Cambridgeshire
'natives' made of the cow-dung:
drying and using it as fuel, as is the common
practice of the natives of our Eastern
Empire.</p>

<p>In the letters which relate to the events
of the Rebellion of 1745, and the march of
the rebels into the heart of England, we
have ample proof alike of the general ignorance
of places now well known to every one,
and of a want of the means of information
in regard even to the great events taking
place in other parts of the kingdom, which
read strangely in these times when every
morning we can know from the newspapers
the very way the wind is blowing in every
quarter of our island. The Highland army
marches to and fro in its daring enterprise,
although several separate armies (Wade's,
Ligonier's, the Duke of Cumberland's, &amp;c.)
are on foot to meet or catch them: indeed,
as we read in these letters, 'more troops are
in England than ever was known before,'
yet notwithstanding, the hardy light-moving
Highlanders get through them all into the
heart of England, and quite as easily back
again. We cannot help thinking that the
English generals had not much stomach for
their work. They were astonished and
something more by the sudden and total
rout of Sir John Cope's army, and by the
daring and marvellous rapidity of the rebels'
march; and it must be allowed that even in
their retreat, the Highlanders gave a good
account of any force that tried to bar their
passage. As the noble editor incidentally
observes, General Wade (who was posted in
the north of England to stop the southward
march of the rebels) only became famous
after the rebellion was over; and his marching
and counter-marching to catch the rebels
was of a very helpless character indeed.</p>

<p>Smuggling, as well as rebellion, profited
greatly by the roadless character of England
in those days. Mr. and Mrs. Harris, on returning
home one night from Heron Court,
then the property of their friend Mr. Hooper,
had great difficulty in getting over Ringwood
Heath, an adjoining waste land, about five
miles in length&mdash;'the vile heath,' as Mrs.
Harris calls it&mdash;even with 'the assistance of
two servants riding before.' Heron Court
now belongs to the Malmesbury family; and
the editor, in a foot-note, states that until
the beginning of the present century there
were no roads but smugglers' tracks across
those heaths. They were a favourite place
for contraband transit from the south coast;
and he mentions that all classes aided in
carrying on this traffic. 'The farmers lent
their teams and labourers, and the gentry
openly connived at the practice, and dealt
with the smugglers. The cargoes, chiefly
of brandy, were easily concealed in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
furze bushes, that extended from Ringwood
to Poole, and in the New Forest for thirty
miles.' We suspect that the impossibility
of carrying on such operations nowadays has
had much more to do with their cessation
than the improvement in the morality of the
age. Look at the customary frauds in making
returns to the income-tax, and then say
whether the middle-classes are a whit more
honest in fiscal matters now than they used
to be when smuggling was rife.</p>

<p>How vastly London has changed and
grown since the last century need not be
said, and the contrast between then and
now, meets one almost in every page of
these lively letters. There was no Rotten-row,
or the fashionable rides in the Park,
which make so gay a sight now in the summer
afternoons; and the whole district north
of the Park knew nothing of the noble
streets and terraces which now occupy the
space. Mrs. Harris speaks with delight, almost
rapture, of the sweet rural beauty of a
'ride to Paddington of a July morning.'
But with all our knowledge of the change
which has come over the British metropolis
since that time, it is startling to find that
some nameless Dick Turpin or Claude Duval
could ply his trade with impunity even
within the courtly precincts of St. James's.
In February, 1773, Mrs. Harris writes that
'a most audacious fellow robbed Sir Francis
Holburne and his sisters in their coach, in
St. James's Square, coming from the
Opera. He was on horseback, and held a
pistol close to the breast of one of the Miss
Holburnes for a considerable time. She
had left her purse at home&mdash;which he would
not believe. He has since robbed a coach
in Park Lane.' In these letters, too, there
is the earliest mention which we have met
with of the tiny member of the finny tribe
which now confers a greater popular renown
upon Greenwich than even its world-famous
Observatory or its magnificent Hospital, and
which for a generation has caused that place
to be the honoured scene of the annual
Ministerial banquet at which our rulers meet
together to congratulate one another upon
the approaching close of the Parliamentary
session,&mdash;the famous 'whitebait dinner,'
which within the last two years has fallen
into abeyance, perhaps never to be revived.
Mr. Harris, the founder of the family and
father of the first Earl Malmesbury, was then
(1763) a Lord of the Admiralty; and Mrs.
Harris describes a 'most agreeable expedition
on the Thames,' which she had with a
party in the 'Admiralty barge.' After seeing
Woolwich and all its military wonders,
the lady says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'We got back to Greenwich to dine. We
had the smallest fish I ever saw, called whitebait:
they are only to be eat at Greenwich,
and are held in high estimation by the epicures;
they are not so large as the smallest of minnows,
but are really very good eating. We dined in
a charming place in the open air, which commanded
a fine view of the Thames; but were
obliged to leave it at six o'clock, as the tide
was so cruel as not to stay for us&mdash;and they
never venture to shoot the bridge [old London
bridge] with the Admiralty barge at low water.
We had a beastly walk through the Borough
after we landed.'</p>
</div>

<p>Let us now quit old England for a moment
to take a passing glance at the Continent.
As we have already said, the 'Diaries
and Correspondence' of the first Earl of
Malmesbury are a rich mine of political information
and personal anecdote concerning
the leading Courts of Europe; but we must
here confine our few gleanings of this kind
from the newly published 'Letters,' and content
ourselves with some sketches of the
state of matters in France, in the period of
decay and rottenness which preceded the
outburst of the terrible but life-reviving
Revolution. Young Mr. Harris (afterwards
the first Earl), then only in his twenty-second
year, is passing through Paris in November,
1768, on his way to assume a diplomatic
post at Madrid, and thus he writes of the
French capital:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'I see no new improvements since I was last
here; and, except a few new fashions for caps
and muffs, I believe nothing has changed materially.
On such subjects alone do this lively
people exercise their inventive faculties, since
the decease of Louis le Grand. They have
now no capital painters, few good sculptors,
and still fewer good authors; for the modern
set of French writers are either totally devoid
of talents, or else employ them in such a manner,
and on such subjects, as to render their
works of very little use to the community. To
pass for an <i>esprit fort</i> is all their ambition;
and when a man has written down all religions,
without distinction, they cry, "<i>Pardi! c'est un
grand homme: il pense hardiment!</i>"'</p>
</div>

<p>Turning from fashion and infidelity, the
young diplomatist in another letter describes
the political aspect of affairs; remarking,
<i>inter alia</i>, that the Government 'are now
expending the revenues of the year 1771
[three years in advance!] at the same time
that the people are labouring under the
greatest necessity; garden stuff and bread,
the chief nourishment of the lower class in
this country, being raised in price one-third
since last winter, and the greatest appearance
also that there will not be a sufficient quantity
of either to supply the winter.' But
Court life and pageantry went on <i>quand</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
<i>m&ecirc;me</i>. Seven years later, a Dr. Jean takes
up the correspondence from Paris. Speaking
of the Anglomania then prevalent, and
which mingled with the Court gaieties, he
writes that the 'young Queen' (Marie Antoinette)
has made herself unpopular by 'a
little misunderstanding in etiquette' between
her and the princes of the blood, and
also by her great predilection for everything
that is English. And he describes a horse
race, 'which is now become a very frequent
and frequented amusement.' Most of the
cavaliers in the concourse were 'badly imitating
the English mode of riding;' also 'ladies
of fashion, clad in boots and leather
breeches, <i>astride</i> on their horses!' The
Queen, with all her court, were upon the
stand at the starting post; and the race was
'managed by English grooms (<i>jack&eacute;s</i> as they
call them) and English horses.' The same
correspondent also gives a description of a
<i>bal par&eacute;</i> in 'the most decorated room perhaps
in the world,' the Opera House at Versailles.
He says that Lord Clive, who was
present, 'declared that Asiatic display of
riches appeared but as tinsel to the brilliancy
of the French court on that occasion.' 'The
room,' says Dr. Jean 'was filled by between
three and four thousand people, dressed in
the richest, and at the same time the most fancied,
taste imaginable. The show which French
ladies always make above those of other nations
added much to the spectacle. The ornaments
of their head-dress, and their robes,
so disposed and varied, composed a most beautiful
<i>tout ensemble</i>. In regard to their persons,
to be sure, they seemed to be almost
all of the same family, from the similarity
of their <i>complexions</i>, and the unity of their
dress. It appeared to me an assembly of
houris.' He describes the Queen as 'very
majestic, and at a distance very handsome,'
also with a remarkably fine hand and arm;
and he adds that she gives life to almost all
public amusements, and 'is very familiar
with those who are in favour,'&mdash;an amiable
though perhaps not dignified <i>trait</i> which
brought her sad woe in the end, in consequence
of the calumnies set on foot against
her by her base and contemptible relative,
the Duke of Orleans, <i>Philippe Egalit&eacute;</i>.</p>

<p>A romantic incident connected with the
French Revolution happened to Lord Malmesbury
in 1793, when the French nobility and
clergy were flying from the sanguinary proscriptions
of the Reign of Terror. He was
walking one day on the pier at Brighton
(not then the scene of gaiety and fashion
which it is now), when a French fishing-boat
approached the pier, and one of the crew
jumped out with a baby in his arms, and addressed
him. The poor fisherman said that
a lady, known and beloved by himself and
his comrades, had thrown the baby into
their boat, entreating them to save its life
by carrying it to England, whither, she said,
if she were spared, she would follow it.
They had accordingly stood over for
Brighton, to entrust the infant, as the lady
desired, to the first Englishman they met.
Lord Malmesbury at once took charge of
the helpless little exile, and had it conveyed
to Lady Malmesbury at his house. In a
few weeks, the mother, after many hair-breadth
escapes, found her way to England,
and knowing where the child had been
landed, soon discovered its place of refuge.
The baby became a handsome and fascinating
woman, and, as Madame Alfred de
Noailles, was for many years a leader of
fashion in the first circles of Paris. When
Lady Malmesbury was at Paris in 1816, we
find her writing of Madame Alfred as 'our
daughter;' and his quondam <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>, in all
her letters to Lord Malmesbury, used to
sign herself 'Leontine Harris.'</p>

<p>Although tempted to linger longer over
these interesting letters, our narrowing
limits warn us that we must leave untrod
a large portion of the field which they present,
alike for gossiping and for sage historical
reflection. But ere we close, we must
say a few words as to the leading members
of the family whose correspondence has now
been given to the world. Of Mr. James
Harris, who, though not himself ennobled,
may justly be regarded as the founder of
the Malmesbury family, we have already
spoken. He was a literary man of fine
tastes, a member of Parliament, and a subordinate
member of several Administrations.
He does not appear to have had the brilliant
abilities of his son, the first Earl; but he
had a pleasant and healthy temperament, a
perfect rectitude of nature, and a sound sagacity,
which qualities have since been hereditary
in the family. There are only a
few letters of his in this collection, but in almost
every one of these, brief though they
are, there is some remark or other which
shows his shrewd and healthy common sense,
whether in great matters or little ones.
When a motion was made in the House
(1770), to restrain revenue officers from
voting at elections (a disfranchisement only
recently removed), Mr. Harris writes that it
was 'a rather tedious debate, full of that patriotic
commonplace which nobody believes
that talks it, nor anyone else but a few dupes
in the provinces.' When we were on the
eve of war with Spain, in 1770, about the
Falkland Islands, he writes:&mdash;'It moves me
to indignation that two respectable nations,
naturally made for friends, should take to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
cutting one another's throats for a paltry island,
not better than Bagshot Heath, and
which if it were merged in the ocean, would
be no loss to either. Let it be with nations
as with individuals: if ye <i>can</i> help it, don't
quarrel at all&mdash;'tis more conformant to your
social nature; but if ye <i>must</i> quarrel, for
heaven's sake let it not be for trifles, for objects
of the lowest contempt.' But when
this Spanish difficulty was happily got over,
to the general satisfaction of the country,
which, he says, 'does not wish a war, whatever
wicked patriots may endeavour;' he
adds, 'None make such audacious use
of the word <i>people</i> as these do&mdash;a word
which often means no more than themselves,
and their ignorant or interested followers.'</p>

<p>His son, the first Earl of Malmesbury, was
perhaps the ablest diplomatist whom England
has produced; certainly he was second to
none in the long roll of distinguished men
who have served the State as ambassadors
and ministers in foreign countries. There
is an anecdote of his boyhood, narrated by
his relative Lord Shaftesbury, which perhaps
may be taken as an indication of the courage
and self-reliance which the youth was
afterwards to display in a very different form.
As his mother was walking one day with
some friends before her house in the Close
at Salisbury, she descried some one climbing
up the spire of the cathedral; and having
obtained a glass the better to observe so
perilous a feat, she immediately dropped it,
exclaiming, 'Good heavens! it is James!'
The astonished lady had discovered her only
son upon the apex of the tallest steeple in
Great Britain. Of his life at Oxford, he
himself (taking a retrospect in 1800) gives a
poor account, either as regards learning or
amusements. He says that the set of men
with whom he lived were very pleasant, but
very idle fellows. 'Our life was an imitation
of high life in London: luckily, drinking
was not the fashion; but what we did drink
was claret, and we had our regular round of
evening card parties, to the great annoyance
of our finances. It has often been a matter of
surprise to me how so many of us [Charles
Fox, Lord Auckland, Bishop North, and others]
made our way so well in the world, and so
creditably.' From Oxford he went to the
University of Leyden; and as he became a
favourite with our Minister at the Hague,
young Harris had ample opportunities of
mingling in the court life, and also of studying
carefully the political affairs of Holland&mdash;a
knowledge which he was afterwards destined
to turn to most valuable account. In the following
year (1767) he made a journey to Prussia,
Poland, and Paris; and in 1768, although
only in his twenty-second year, he was appointed
secretary of embassy at the Court of
Madrid. In this post, an opportunity arising,
the youth greatly distinguished himself; for,
having been temporarily left charg&eacute; d'affaires,
he undertook upon his own responsibility the
critical affair of the Falkland Islands, which
he conducted so admirably as to win the
praise of both political parties at home; and
the issue, so honourable to England, at once
established his diplomatic reputation, and
obtained for him in the following year the
post of Minister at Berlin, where Frederick
the Great, although past his prime, reigned in
the full vigour of his tyrannical and eccentric
genius. Next, after a few months in England
in 1776, when he married, he was sent to
St. Petersburg as our minister at the Court
of the Empress Catherine, whose shameless
passion for 'favourites' affected even her
policy, and where he had a hard battle to fight,
owing to the Empress's ill-will to England, although
his <i>esprit</i> and remarkable conversational
talents made him personally much
more liked by the Empress than any of his
diplomatic rivals. It appears to have been a
costly office, and diplomatic salaries at that
time were so inadequate that on leaving
Russia he had diminished his private fortune
to the extent of &pound;20,000.</p>

<p>The severe climate of Russia broke down
his health, and he returned to England in
1782, having previously received from the
King the Order of the Bath, in acknowledgement
of his services at the Russian Court.
But two years afterwards he was despatched
to the Hague, at that moment the scene of
the most active political operations and
manoeuvres; the Stadtholder being then
threatened with deposition, and Holland
with subjection to France. In this emergency,
Sir James Harris matured a bold plan
of an Anglo-Prussian alliance and an intervention
on behalf of Holland; a project
which Mirabeau, the French agent at Berlin,
when he got wind of it, scouted as absurd,
<i>et seulement la conception personelle de cet
audacieux et rus&eacute; Harris</i>, but which completely
succeeded&mdash;freeing Holland from her
peril, and winning high fame for its bold
projector, who was created Baron Malmesbury,
and received honours from the King
of Prussia and the Stadtholder. Lord Malmesbury
now enjoyed the almost unbounded
confidence of his Government in all matters
relating to foreign politics, and was entrusted
with all the most important missions. In
1793, he was sent to Berlin, and in 1796 and
again in the following year he was sent to
France to endeavour to negotiate a peace
with the French Directory. We cannot do
more than simply mention those important
missions; but we cannot refrain from noticing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
a mission of a very different kind which
befel him in 1794, when he received orders
'to ask of the Duke of Brunswick his
daughter in marriage for the Prince of
Wales.' Lord Malmesbury had little hope
of this union turning out well, but he had no
discretionary power in the matter, so he
married her Royal Highness by proxy, and
brought her over to England. The Prince
of Wales never forgave Lord Malmesbury for
his share in this affair, which was certainly
hard upon his Lordship, especially as he had
no end of difficulties with the German princess,
as well as with some of the ladies of
the Court, who had reasons of their own for
hating Prince George's <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>. Here is his
Lordship's account of the first interview between
the Princess and her royal betrothed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'I, according to the established etiquette,
introduced (no one else being in the room) the
Princess Caroline to him. She very properly,
in consequence of my saying to her it was the
right mode of proceeding, attempted to kneel to
him. He raised her (gracefully enough), and
embraced her, said barely one word, turned
round, retired to a distant part of the apartment,
and calling me to him said, "Harris, I
am not well, pray get me a glass of brandy."
I said, "Sir, had you not better have a glass of
water?" upon which he, much out of humour,
said with an oath, "No!" and away he went.
The Princess, left during the short moment
alone, was in a state of astonishment, and on
my joining her said, "<i>Mon Dieu! est-ce que le
Prince est toujours comme cela? Je le trouve
tr&egrave;s gros, et nullement aussi beau que son
portrait.</i>" I said His Royal Highness was
naturally a good deal affected and flurried at this
first interview, but she certainly would find
him different at dinner.</p>

<p>'At dinner I was far from satisfied with the
Princess's behaviour; it was flippant, rattling,
affected raillery and wit, and throwing out
coarse vulgar hints about Lady &mdash;&mdash;, who was
present, and, though mute, <i>le diable n'en perdait
rien</i>. The Prince was evidently disgusted.
And this unfortunate dinner fixed his dislike,
which, when, left to herself, the Princess had
not the talent to remove, but, by still observing
the same giddy manners and attempts at
cleverness and coarse sarcasm, increased it till
it became positive hatred.'</p>
</div>

<p>Soon after the Earl's last diplomatic mission
to France, in 1797, he was seriously
attacked by deafness, in consequence of
which infirmity he thought it right to decline
all further State employment either in the
Cabinet or abroad; but during the lives of
Mr. Pitt and the Duke of Portland, he remained
in the most intimate political confidence
of those Ministers and their principal
colleagues. Indeed, during the greater part
of the war with Napoleon, every scrap of
important news received at the Foreign Office
appears to have been forwarded to him; and
in 1814 he was consulted by Lord Liverpool's
Government on the readjustment of Europe,
and the arrangements relating to Holland,
Belgium, Luxembourg, and Prussia, were
principally suggested and settled by him.
During the closing years of his life (he died
in 1820, at the age of seventy-five), he passed
most of his time in London and at Parkplace,
his seat near Henley, receiving at his
house constantly, and with the same pleasure,
the rising generation of statesmen and literary
men, as he had shown formerly in
associating with his own distinguished contemporaries.
He early appreciated the high
talents of Mr. Canning, Lord Grenville, and
Lord Palmerston, and used his influence with
the statesmen of the time to draw special
attention to those illustrious men who have
now become memorable in English history.
He was the guardian of Lord Palmerston,
and by his influence obtained for him his
first official appointment.</p>

<p>Two portraits of the Earl are given in
these volumes: one taken in the early part
of his career when he was simple Mr. Harris,
the other when he was full of years and
honours, at the age of seventy. Both are
handsome faces, but though the first has the
advantage of youth, with a look of <i>esprit</i>
and lively courage, the second is really the
finer and nobler head&mdash;a phenomenon only
observable in rare cases, where high intellect
is united with goodness of heart and a well-balanced
temperament. His grandson, who
edits these works, and who&mdash;in consonance
with the principles of life so wisely and
admirably laid down by the first Earl, with
special reference to the nobility, but whose
beautiful precepts are applicable to all spheres
of life&mdash;has devoted himself from youth to
the public service, and has twice been the
Foreign Minister of England, appends some
true remarks as to the difference in the work
and responsibilities of diplomatists which
has been created by the progress of civilization
and the great change in the political condition
of the nations of Europe. But the result of
those changes has been to lessen the responsibility
and lighten the labour of our Ministers
abroad, and the contrast serves only to
heighten the well-won reputation of the
diplomatist whose 'Letters and Correspondence'
have supplied materials for this article.
The cynical but pre-eminently sagacious
Talleyrand, speaking simply of Lord Malmesbury's
intellectual powers and knowledge of
human nature, apart from those high personal
qualities by which he was distinguished,
said, <i>Je crois que Lord Malmesbury &eacute;tait le
plus habile Ministre que vous aviez de son

<i>fallait le suivre de pr&egrave;s. Si on lui laissait
le dernier mot, il avait toujours raison.</i> And
as is shown alike by his official career, and
by his private correspondence, we may well
apply to the first Lord Malmesbury the
epithet by which M. Thiers has so truly characterized
Mr. Pitt&mdash;'ce pur Anglais.'</p>

<p class="p2">The Palestine Exploration Society was established
in 1865, for the accurate and systematic
investigation of the archeology, topography,
geology, physical geography, and
manners and customs of the Holy Land, for
Biblical illustration. The universality of interest
belonging to Palestine, and the inefficiency
of individual efforts at exploration,
made the step advisable; while the success
of the Ordnance Survey of Jerusalem in 1864
at once suggested the scheme and gave encouragement
to its promoters. In the original
prospectus of the Society it was proposed
to excavate at Jerusalem for the purpose of
ascertaining the extent of the Temple enclosure,
the position of the tombs of the kings,
the site of the Tower of Antonia, &amp;c; to
examine other important sites, such as Gerizim,
Samaria, Jiljilieh (probably Gilgal) and
the mounds at Jericho; to collect materials
for a work on manners and customs comparable
to Mr. Lane's 'Modern Egyptians;' to
effect an accurate survey of the Holy Land; to
determine levels and sites and the course of
ancient roads; to investigate the geology of
the country, especially in the Valley of Jordan
and basin of the Dead Sea; and lastly,
to apply the same energy and ability to the
study of the botany, zoology, and meteorology
of Palestine, which naturalists have
given to those of the forests of South America
and the rivers of Africa. The time is
come when we may ask how much of this
programme has been carried out, and what
amount of light, if any, is being thrown on
the Scriptural history. Three years ago, we
touched upon the subject;<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> but the Society
was then in its infancy, its work only just
begun, and the publication of results confined
to one or two small pamphlets. We now
have at least enough reports to make a thick
octavo volume, and these so packed with
technical details that they will have to be
spread out into three volumes more before
their information can be grasped by the ordinary
reader. We have, moreover, now
before us the book called the 'Recovery of
Jerusalem,' which is partly such an expansion
and partly a comment on the work, with
a trifle of new material.</p>

<p>The active work of the Society commenced
in December, 1865, when Captain Wilson,
E.E., and Lieutenant Anderson, E.E., with
Corporal Phillips, as photographer, landed at
Beyrout, to probe the country from north to
south. Captain Wilson was the intelligent
officer who had surveyed Jerusalem the previous
year, and given us a map of that city,
as accurate and reliable in every particular
as any map to be had to-day of the city of
London. This first expedition, in the course
of six months, traversed Palestine from Damascus
to Hebron, constructing a series of
maps of the entire backbone of the country,
excavating at Tel Salhiyeh (near Damascus),
at Kedes (Kadesh Naphtali), and Mount
Gerizim; examining remains of ancient synagogues,
copying old inscriptions, collecting
materials for about fifty plans, with detailed
drawings of churches, synagogues, mosques,
temples, and tombs, and tracing the ancient
system of irrigation of the Plain of Gennesareth.
The report of this tentative expedition
was in favour of Jerusalem as the headquarters
of any future exploring party, since
that city promised to prove the greatest mine
of discoveries, and to yield the quickest results.
Accordingly, in November, 1866, we
find Lieutenant Warren, R.E., at work in
Palestine, at first with only Sergeant Birtles
for his assistant, but afterwards with several
corporals as well, and with permission to engage
a number of native labourers, according
to the amount of excavation going on. Lieutenant
Warren spent two months in survey-work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
east and west of Jordan, and then concentrated
his energies on Jerusalem, where
he laboured at shafts and galleries almost incessantly,
till he was invalided home, in May
of the year 1870.</p>

<p>Although the operations at Jerusalem, besides
being the more extensive, are also the
more interesting in character, it may be well
to look, first, at the results of Captain Wilson's
expedition, and in connection with that
officer's work, to consider the later labours of
Warren, where they are of the same kind.
First, with regard to the survey-work: it is
marvellous that we have never yet had a decently
correct map of the land in which all
Christians are so much interested. The Admiralty
have given us correct charts of the
coast-line, but in the interior of the country
hundreds of sites remain to be verified,
and hundreds to be discovered; while
the east of Jordan is almost a <i>terra
incognita</i>, and the maps of it scarcely
more than creations of the fancy. It is as
though in England we were acquainted with
but the line of the Great Northern Railway
and the towns within a little distance of it
on either side, and in Wales knew only the
position of three or four of the principal
towns. The Wilson exploring party fixed
for the first time the exact latitude and longitude
of nearly seventy places between Damascus
and Jerusalem, determined many
sites, ascertained heights, and recorded
the features of the ground along which they
passed. Lieutenant Warren has obtained the
latitude and longitude of many scores of
places, fixed the height of some hundreds,
and surveyed so much ground that the committee
are able to announce the map of Palestine,
on the scale of one inch to the mile,
as 'now approaching completion.' Much of
this work was done in the dangerous country
east of Jordan, where life is not safe without
an escort, and the sheikh who bargains to protect
you is ready to sell you to the next
chieftain who thinks your friends can pay a
ransom.</p>

<p>Connected with the surveying is the settlement
of topographical questions. We have
seen an old book which professed to give the
latitude and longitude of every place visited
by the Scriptural kings, prophets and apostles,
with their relative positions and distances
from one another in miles. Such information,
if reliable, would be of great value,
for there is so close a connection between
history and geography that in some cases
the first cannot be understood without a
knowledge of the second; and in most cases
the geographical or topographical knowledge
will at least assist us to realise the history.</p>

<p>In this department our knowledge is still
scanty, though good service has been rendered
by the explorers. The site of Capernaum,
which has been fixed in three different
places by Egmont, Robinson, and De Saulcy,
and which Dean Stanley regarded as utterly
lost, has been fixed by Wilson with very
small chance of error, where S&oelig;wulf placed
it in the beginning of the twelfth century,
viz., at Tel Hum,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> on the north-western corner
of the lake. The determining circumstance
was the discovery of the irrigation of
the plain of Gennesareth, as described by
Josephus,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and its connection with the Tabighah
Fountain, whereas attention had previously
been fixed on the Round Fountain.
It is confirmatory of Wilson's view, that
while at the Round Fountain there are no
ruins, except some small foundations which
may have been anything, Tel Hum possesses
extensive ruins, including those of a synagogue.
Two miles north of Tel Hum&mdash;at
Kerazeh, a spot indicated by the Rev. G.
Williams, in 1842, and indeed by Pococke,
as early as 1740&mdash;Lieutenant Anderson identified
Chorazin, by the presence of extensive
remains, including those of a synagogue. Of
no less interest is the discovery of the scene
of the destruction of the herd of swine.
Lord Lindsay, Mr. Elliott, and others had
been on the eastern shores of the lake, but
their accounts were mutually contradictory;
and Dean Stanley, after rewriting his note on
the place again and again, had been obliged
to scratch it out altogether. It now appears
that there is only one place&mdash;namely, Khersa,
about half way between Wady F&icirc;k and
Wady Semakh&mdash;which fulfils all the conditions
required by the Biblical narrative. The
hills which everywhere else on the eastern
side receded from a half to three-quarters of
a mile from the water's edge, here approach
within forty feet of it; not, indeed, terminating
abruptly, but presenting a steep, even
slope. The 'Dictionary of the Bible' places
the scene at Gadara, now Um Keis, a place
from which the swine would have had a hard
gallop of two hours before reaching the lake.</p>

<p>We have also in these publications an admirable
paper by Captain Wilson, 'On the
site of Ai and the position of the Altar which
Abram built between Bethel and Ai;' and
another by the Rev. Dr. Zeller, Protestant
clergyman at Nazareth, on 'Kefr Kenna.'
As the old Hebrew names of places commonly
cling to the spot under some Arabic disguise&mdash;the
hill of Dan, for instance, being
now Tel el-Kadi (both Kadi in Arabic, and
Dan in Hebrew, being equivalent to 'judge'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
in English)&mdash;it is doing good service to collect
Arabic names. Great care, however, is
needed in this work, for the same <i>wady</i> may
have different names in different parts; two
or three hills, a fountain, and several ruins
may all have one name&mdash;that of the district;
and the traveller may misunderstand the Arabic
answers to his questions. Mr. Layard
tells a story of a traveller, who published,
for the benefit of those who might follow in
his footsteps, a little vocabulary, but whose
own ignorance of the language is shown by
the fact that several places on his map are
marked with the word <i>Mabarafsh</i>. The fact
was, that when the traveller asked his guide
the name of a place the man answered
<i>Mabarafsh</i>&mdash;'I don't know,' and down went
this name on the map. In the same traveller's
vocabulary 'nose' is put down as <i>snuff</i>;
for when he wanted the word for nose he
had probably raised his hand, and the Arab
supposed he wanted 'snuff.' Under these
circumstances, it must have been very satisfactory
to Lieutenant Warren, after making
a list of 150 places visited or seen on the
east of Jordan, to find that wherever Robinson
had been before him there was substantial
agreement in the spelling. Lieutenant
Warren and Dr. Chaplin, of Jerusalem, also
obtained many names in the course of a tour
from Jisr Damieh to Jisr Mejamia and back;
and the former has given us a list of thirty-four
Tels in the Jordan valley. More work
of the same kind will have to be done, as
there is much confusion in the spelling of
names; besides which there exist many unnamed
cities and ruins on both sides of the
Jordan. South of Amm&acirc;n (the ancient Rabbath-Amman,
and afterwards Philadelphia,
2 Sam. xi. and xii.), Lieutenant Warren came
upon a piece of elevated country, about four
miles square, literally covered with ruins of
temples and houses.</p>

<p>The synagogue at Capernaum was only
one out of nine synagogues examined in the
district north of the Sea of Galilee, and the
investigation was so thorough that the plan
of the building was made out, and careful
drawings made and measurements taken.
The result has been to dissipate the idea
that the synagogues were barn-like structures,
and to prove that they had considerable
architectural pretensions.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'They all lie north and south, have three
gateways in the southern end, the interior
divided into five aisles, by four rows of columns,
and the two northern corners formed
by double engaged columns. The style of
decoration does not always appear to have
been the same. At Tel Hum (the strongest
claimant for the site of Capernaum) and
Kerazeh (Chorazin), Corinthian capitals were
found; at Irbid, a mixture of Corinthian and
Ionic; whilst Kefr Birim, Meiron, Um el-Amud
have capitals of a peculiar character. The
faces of the lintels over the gateway are usually
ornamented with some device; at Nebartein
there is an inscription and representation
of the seven-branched candlestick; at Kefr
Birim the ornament appears to have been intended
for the Paschal lamb; and at Tel Hum
there are the pot of manna and lamb. A scroll
of vine leaves, with bunches of grapes, is one
of the most frequent ornaments. The investigator
cannot fail to be struck by their resemblance
in plan&mdash;accidental or otherwise&mdash;to the
palaces of Persepolis and to the House of the
Forest of Lebanon, built by Solomon.'</p>
</div>

<p>For particular description and measurements
our architectural readers must be referred
to Captain Wilson's paper in Quarterly
Statement No. II. These synagogues
date either from the Christian era or the
centuries immediately following. Mr. R.
Phen&eacute; Spiers, M.R.I.B.A., says, from the third
to the sixth centuries, inclusive. The Rev.
George Williams, of Cambridge, assigns
them to a period prior to the destruction of
Jerusalem, both because the depopulation
of the country after that event made it
almost impossible that they should have
been built subsequently, and because the
style of ornament so much resembled that of
the tombs of the kings (so-called) at Jerusalem.
In that case they may have been
trodden by the feet of Christ; and the
ruins of Capernaum may be remains of the
very building concerning which the Jewish
elders said, the centurion is worthy&mdash;'for
he loveth our nation, and hath built us
the synagogue.' Yet Dr. Robinson, whose
ears and eyes seemed to be open to hear and
see all that was really to be heard and seen
in connection with sacred topography, did
not mention these various ruins till his second
journey in 1852, giving then only a
brief account of them, while previous to that
year there had been no account of them at
all.</p>

<p>Another admirable paper of Wilson's, also
illustrated with plans, is 'On the Remains of
Tombs in Palestine.' Rock-hewn tombs appear
to be the earliest in date, and are the
tombs most commonly met with, the softer
strata of limestone, especially the white chalk
in some districts, being well adapted for excavation.
Sometimes a natural cavern is
made use of, sometimes a square or oblong
chamber is cut in the rock, while in a
third class one entrance leads into a number
of sepulchral chambers; and in all these
cases <i>loculi</i> or resting-places for the bodies
are either sunk in the surface of the rock
much after the manner of a modern grave,
or driven into the rock-face like a small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
tunnel or pigeon-hole. In the so-called
tomb of Joshua at Tibneh, after passing
through a chamber with fourteen <i>loculi</i>, a
smaller one is reached which has only one
<i>loculus</i> at its extreme end, an arrangement
not noticed elsewhere; the face and sides of
the porch are nearly covered with niches
for lamps, and round the door are traces of
plaster. The tombs of the kings at Jerusalem
come into this class, and are described,
as well as the tombs of the prophets, the
tombs of the Judges, and a large tomb discovered
by Lieut. Warren in the Kedron
valley. Masonry tombs, which constitute
the second class, are few in number, and
confined to the northern portion of the country.
It is possible that at Tel Hum, where
the (basaltic) rock is so hard as to make excavation
difficult, this form of tomb was
commonly used. If the tombs in which the
demoniac lived were of this description,
their disappearance is not at all surprising.
Besides these two classes of tombs, and their
subdivisions, sarcophagi are sometimes found,
those at Kedes (Kadesh Naphtali, the city
of refuge in the midst of Canaanite strongholds)
being the most elaborately ornamented.
The material is hard white limestone,
almost marble, and the workmanship is excellent:
the usual design on the sides is a
garland held up in two or more loops by
nude figures, with some device over each
end and a bunch of grapes hanging from the
bottom. Two sarcophagi have been shipped
to England by Lieut. Warren, and were exhibited,
with other articles, at the Dudley
Gallery in the summer of last year.</p>

<p>A paper in these Quarterly Statements,
which has greatly pleased the architects is
that on the ruined temples of C&oelig;le-Syria.
In the summer of 1869, <i>Captain</i> Warren
(we are glad to notice his promotion) was
obliged to take his party to the Lebanon in
consequence of their having suffered severely
from fever in Jerusalem. While there they
occupied themselves in investigating the
ruined temples of C&oelig;le-Syria and Mount
Hermon, and the exhaustive manner in
which the work was done, places us in possession
of so much information that we
may be said to have previously known nothing
at all on the subject. The extremely
careful tracings (fifteen in number) sent
home by Captain Warren are to be seen at
the office of the Fund; but two of them,
selected by the advice of Mr. Fergusson, are
given to subscribers with Captain Warren's
complete and detailed account of the temples
in Quarterly Statement No. V. The
temples of C&oelig;le-Syria date from Roman
times, and the inscriptions found on them
are mostly Greek. The small temples about
Mount Hermon appear to be somewhat more
ancient, their architecture being of the Ionic
order. On the summit of Hermon stands
the ruins of a sacellum, <i>i.e.</i>, a rectangular
building without a roof, which has nothing
in its construction in common with the
temples on the west below, and which probably
had to do with a different and more
ancient form of worship. Captain Warren's
investigations led him into a discussion of
the question of the orientation of heathen
temples. It had been surmised by Dr. Robinson
and several other writers that the
temples about Hermon were turned towards
it as to a kibleh, so that the worshippers
might face it when they prayed; but now
that the directions and angles are taken, it
is found that they all have their entrances
more or less towards the <i>east</i>, and in no case
does the entrance or any side of the building
face direct upon the summit of Hermon.
The Jewish tabernacle and afterwards the
temple at Jerusalem faced the east&mdash;according
to Josephus&mdash;in order that when the
sun arose it might send its first rays upon it;
according to some of the Jews of the present
day, in order that the priest might watch
for the first dawn of day in offering up the
morning sacrifice.</p>

<p>The principle which accounts for the eastward
aspect of the temple at Jerusalem, accounts
also for the southward aspect of the
synagogues of Galilee: as that was open to
the east, so they were open to the temple.
It would be a crucial test of this theory to
examine the remains of a synagogue said to
exist near Beersheba, the only ruin of the
kind which is not due north from Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The mention of temples reminds us that
on Mount Gerizim numerous excavations
were made under the direction of Lieut. Anderson.
Within the ruins known as the
'Castle,' the foundations of an octagonal
church were laid bare, probably the church
known to have been built there by Justinian.
On the eastern side of the church is an apse,
on the northern side the main entrance, and
on each of the others, doors leading to small
side chapels. In the interior are the piers
of a smaller octagon, apparently intended to
carry a dome. The church and castle were
found to be built on a rough platform of
large stones laid together without mortar,
and of this&mdash;which may possibly be the
platform on which the Samaritan Temple
stood&mdash;the 'twelve stones,' fabled to have
been brought up by the tribes from the bed
of the Jordan, form a portion. No trace of
large foundations could be found on the
southern portion of the small plateau on
which the castle stands. Close to the Holy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
Rock of the Samaritans a number of human
remains were dug up, but no clue could be
obtained to their age or nationality. The
study of the synagogue remains of Galilee,
as well as the temples, mosques, churches,
tombs, inscriptions, aqueducts, castles,
theatres, ruined cities and general aspect of
the country, is much facilitated by the series
of 350 photographs taken by the two expeditions,
which are most of them beautifully
executed and very many of them taken for
the first time.</p>

<p>We must now follow Captain Warren to
Jerusalem, where the longer course of the
operations supplies us with larger results for
criticism; and the <i>reason</i> for the more extended
labours is a reason for our devoting
more space to their consideration; it being
simply the paramount interest of Jerusalem
and the richness of the field Scripturally,
historically, and arch&aelig;ologically. The
ground on which the city of Jerusalem
stands is included in a fork between two
ravines, whose point of union is to the south-east
of the city, near the Well of Joab, and
which, if we trace them backward, may be
said to clasp the city, the one on the south
and west, the other on the east. The eastern
ravine is known as the Valley of Jehoshaphat
or of the Kedron, the westernmost as
the Valley of Hinnom. On the north side
they run up to the level of the northern part
of the city; so that Jerusalem is not an
isolated hill, but the southern tongue of a
great plateau which stretches away northward.
This table-land is one of the highest
in the country, and Jerusalem is about 2,500
feet above the level of the Mediterranean,
while the Dead Sea, only twelve miles to the
east, is 1,300 feet below the same. Of the
cities of Palestine, Jerusalem alone is thus
entrenched with deep ravines&mdash;a mountain
fastness, with natural defences on every side
except the north; and to this circumstance
she owed in a great measure her early strength
and subsequent greatness. After Joshua's
conquest, the aboriginal inhabitants of Palestine,
who elsewhere lingered only in the
plains, were, able here to maintain a position
in the hills;<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and Joshua, Barak, Gideon,
and Saul passed away without seeing the
Jebusites conquered. When David became
king of all Israel, it was necessary to fix his
capital farther north than Hebron, and no
city appeared so suitable as Jebus, both on
account of its strength and its central position,
and perhaps also from the circumstance
that it was partly in the tribe of Judah, to
which David belonged, and partly in Benjamin,
the tribe of Saul. So strong was the
citadel that the blind and the lame were
thought sufficient to defend the walls; but
the steep ascent was climbed by Joab, and
David 'took the stronghold of Zion.' Before
David's time the men of Judah and the
men of Benjamin had gained some partial
successes at Jerusalem, and perhaps before
the Israelitish invasion the city had experienced
varied fortunes in the wars of the
aboriginal tribes among themselves. But in
the 3,000 years since David's time, how
eventful has been its history! From David
to Nebuchadnezzar, from Nebuchadnezzar
to Pompey and Titus, from Titus to the
Crusaders, from Saladin to Sultan Suliman,
who built the present walls in 1542, the
sieges have been no fewer than twenty;
while the city has been four or five times
sacked or utterly destroyed.</p>

<p>It is very much in consequence of the repeated
destruction of its walls and buildings
that its topography has become so much obscured.
This could hardly have been the
case with any other city of which we had
such full descriptions, nor with Jerusalem if
ravines had not run <i>through</i> the city as well
as round it; the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> has found its way
into these intramural valleys, from which its
removal was difficult and perhaps inadvisable.
The description which Josephus gives of the
city is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'The city was built upon two hills, which
are opposite to one another and have a valley
to divide them asunder; at which valley the
corresponding rows of houses on both hills end.
Of these hills that which contains the upper
city is much higher, and in length more direct.
Accordingly it was called the citadel by king
David (he was the father of that Solomon who
built this temple at the first); but it is by us
called the Upper Market Place. But the other
hill, which was called Akra, and sustains the
lower city, is of the shape of a crescent moon.
Over against this was a third hill, but naturally
lower than Akra, and parted formerly from the
other by a broad valley. However, in those
times when the Asamoneans reigned, they filled
up that valley with earth and had a mind to
join the city to the temple. They then took
off part of the height of Akra and reduced it
to be of less elevation than it was before, that
the temple might be superior to it. Now, the
valley of the cheesemakers, as it was called,
being that which we told you before distinguished
the hill of the upper city from that of
the lower, extended as far as Siloam; for that
is the name of a fountain which hath sweet
water in it, and that in great plenty also. But
on the outsides these hills are surrounded by
deep valleys, and by reason of the precipices
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
to them belonging on both sides, they are
everywhere unpassable.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>'In section 2 of the same chapter, he says,
"It was Agrippa who encompassed the parts
added to the old city with this [third] wall,
which had been all naked before; for as the
city grew more populous it gradually crept beyond
its old limits, and those parts of it that
stood northward of the temple and joined that
hill to the city, made it considerably larger, and
occasioned that hill, which is in number the
fourth, and is called Bezetha, to be inhabited
also."'</p>
</div>
<p>It would be easy from these descriptions
to trace an ideal map of Jerusalem with its
ancient hills and valleys; but such a map
would not correspond by a long way with
Jerusalem as it is now. The city, as enclosed
by its walls to-day, approximates to
the form of a parallelogram whose eastern
and western sides run north and south, but
whose western side as a whole stands more
southerly than its eastern side as a whole.
From outside the Damascus Gate, near the
middle of the north wall, a very marked
valley traverses the city, deepening as it
runs southward, and terminating by a junction
with the Kedron valley outside the
south wall, near the Pool of Siloam. The
half of the city to the west of this valley is
the higher of the two, and is itself highest
at its north-western part; the half of the
city to the east consists of the Haram esh-Sher&ecirc;f&mdash;a
raised platform about 1,500 feet
from north to south and 900 feet from east
to west, and of about an equal space of
streets and houses. The Haram is the southern
portion and is separately enclosed with
walls, though its entire east wall and two-thirds
of the south are coincident, so far,
with the walls of the city. The one valley
from Damascus Gate gives us two hills within
the city; but according to Josephus there
were four, and even if we suppose that
Bezetha, the 'new town,' last added to the
city, was afterwards excluded from it by a
narrowing of the compass of the walls, we
must still find a second valley to give us a
third hill. In the part of the city to the
north of the Haram area a valley runs down
from Herod's Gate in the north wall towards
St. Stephen's Gate in the east wall; but the
narrow ridge on the north-east side of this
valley is connected with the high ground
outside the city, and can hardly be of itself
the third hill we are in search of. There
must have been a valley then which has become
obliterated&mdash;in fact, Josephus tells us
that the Maccabees did fill up a valley, to connect
the city with the temple, in the second
century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> But inasmuch as the valley is
not now apparent, it has to be supplied from
conjecture, and in consequence we have had
a mass of topographical controversy unequalled
for its extent, its confusion, and its
bitterness. The valley from the Damascus
Gate is usually identified with Josephus's
Tyrop&oelig;on valley or valley of the cheesemakers;
but some writers bring a valley
across from the Jaffa Gate, which is near
the middle of the west wall, into this north-and-south
valley, and call it the Tyrop&oelig;on
from Jaffa Gate to Siloam. The valley from
Damascus Gate, again, is often made to send
off a branch to the east across the Haram platform,
cutting it sometimes near its northern
wall and sometimes farther south than the
dome of the rock or Mosque of Omar, which
stands on a smaller platform near the centre
of the larger. It is disputed, also, which is
the valley of Hinnom, which the valley of
Kedron, whether Hinnom was not on the
east of the city, and whether Gihon did not
come down through the middle of the city.</p>

<p>The fate of the valleys determines the
fate of the hills, and we are perplexed to
know which was Mount Zion, which Moriah,
and which Akra, nothing seeming to be certain
except that the modern Zion (the western
hill) is not the ancient Zion, that the
Temple (and therefore Moriah) was somewhere
within the Haram enclosure, and that
the hill to the east of the present Kedron
valley is the Mount of Olives. The position
of the hills and valleys determines the course
of the streams; for the brook Kedron presumably
followed the valley of that name,
the Pools of Gihon were in the valley of
Gihon (if there was a valley of Gihon); and
when Hezekiah 'brought the upper watercourse
of Gihon straight down to the west
side of the city of David,' the direction of
the new channel depends on the position assigned
to 'the city of David, which is Zion.'<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
On the position and contour of the hills,
again, depends the direction of the ancient
walls; for these would in general follow the
brow of the hill, except on the north side,
where the ground made no descent, while
Zion appears to have been separately enclosed,
so as to need a siege by itself. Until
we know the direction of the walls, we know
not where to look for the gates and towers,
nor for the sepulchres of the kings, which
were most of them within the city of
David;<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> nor for the Holy Sepulchre, which
was <i>outside</i> the gates. A grand point also
is the exact site of the temple, which carries
with it that of Antonia, which Josephus
says was at the junction of the north and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
west cloisters, and may also help us to find
Solomon's palace, and to determine the position
of the king's gardens. It must be evident
that, while these points remain unsettled,
the history of Jerusalem, from
David's age to that of Titus, must lack for
us the definiteness and vividness which are
so essential to its complete understanding.
Of theories we have had enough&mdash;they are
guesses not without a certain value, but
guesses almost in the dark&mdash;facts are wanted,
to test and correct the theories; and these
facts the Palestine Exploration Committee
promised to supply.</p>

<p>Captain Warren saw that two courses
were open to him, in his endeavours to recover
a first thread of the old topography&mdash;(1)
to obtain the contours of the ground as
they existed in olden times; (2) to dig about
the supposed site of some remarkable building,
in hopes of finding its remains. Both
these methods were adopted; and although
excavation is not allowed in the sacred
places, and the work has been crippled elsewhere
for want of funds, enough has been
ascertained to settle several disputed points,
and to alter the conditions of controversy
for time to come. First, as regards the hills
and valleys, the Tyrop&oelig;on valley, which it
was conjectured might contain thirty or forty
feet of <i>d&eacute;bris</i>, is found, by excavation, to be
filled up in some places to nearly one hundred
feet; and instead of presenting an even slope,
its western side is nearly level, the final descent
being very steep, and the lowest course
of the valley being <i>inside</i> the Haram, about
sixty feet east of the south-west angle. The
Kedron valley is found to contain sixty or
eighty feet of loose stone chippings and
other <i>d&eacute;bris</i>, forming a sloping bank, with
an inclination of about thirty degrees, and
having its base resting against the western
slope of Olivet. One effect of this accumulation
has been to alter the bed of the
stream, so far as there is now any stream at
all, pushing it forty feet to the east, and
raising it thirty-eight feet from its old level.
At what must have been the ancient bed of
the brook the remains of a masonry wall
were touched; between that line and the
east of the Haram several other walls were
encountered, and at last progress up the hill
was stopped&mdash;at a point fifty feet east of the
Haram&mdash;by a massive masonry wall, into
which Warren drove a hole five feet, and
then had to give up the business. A contribution
from M. Clermont Ganneau, of the
French Consulate at Jerusalem, affords Mr.
Warren an argument in favour of the identity
of Kedron and Hinnom. There have
always been several reasons for considering
the Virgin's Fount, in the Kedron, to be the
same with En Rogel, where Adonijah was
saluted as king, though many place it at the
Well of Joab, lower down. Near to En
Rogel was the stone of Zoheleth (1 Kings i.
9), and near to the Virgin's Fount M. Ganneau
discovers a rock called Ez Zehwele; so
that the statements of Joshua xv. and xviii.,
which make the border between Judah and
Benjamin to pass Zoheleth to En Rogel, and
thence up the valley of Hinnom, seem to
identify Hinnom with what is now called
Kedron. As the Kedron has three names to-day
in different parts of its course, there
would thus far be no objection to a fourth,
but the statements in Joshua seem to us to
point to some valley more westward than
that now called Kedron.
The principal reason for tracing the Tyrop&oelig;on
from the Jaffa Gate arises from Josephus's
description of the valley as an open
space or depression within the city, 'at
which the corresponding rows of houses on
both hills end.' This was held to be more
applicable to a valley running from the Jaffa
Gate than to that from the Damascus Gate
when the slope is so gradual that the rows
of houses now run across it without interruption,
besides which it probably had formerly
a wall on either side of it. Mr.
Lewin<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> speaks positively as to the Tyrop&oelig;on
commencing at the Jaffa Gate, and
says it can be traced thence to the Haram
by the <i>rise</i> of ground which is still very
perceptible on the right hand, as you walk
down the street from the gate to the Haram.
He makes this valley the boundary of the
high town on the north, and puts his first
wall on the southern brow of it. It is difficult
to see on this hypothesis how the hill
of the high town could be 'in length more
direct' than the eastern hill, as Josephus says
it was; or how the corresponding rows of
houses could meet any more readily than
near Damascus Gate. However, Mr. Warren,
after excavation, tells us that 'a very
decided valley runs down from the Jaffa
Gate to the Tyrop&oelig;on, near Wilson's arch;'
and he found under the causeway leading
westward from Wilson's arch, vaults and
chambers, and a secret passage, at a depth
which serves to confirm his view. There is
no disputing facts, though it seems to us
still questionable whether this valley is any
part of the Tyrop&oelig;on of Josephus.
The valley running south-east from
Herod's Gate, in the north-east part of the
north wall, proves to be longer and deeper
than any theorist had imagined, running
into the Kedron at a point between the
north-east angle of the Haram and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
Golden Gate, and being filled in with more
than 100 feet of <i>d&eacute;bris</i>. The Pool of
Bethesda, which is 360 feet in length, is
imbedded in this valley, and stretches across
it, having its ends formed by the rocky
sides of the valley, and its sides built up of
masonry; and since it is found lined with
concrete, it must have been a reservoir, and
not the fosse of Antonia, which Robinson
supposed it to be.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The valley which Simon Maccabeus filled
up<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> is made by Mr. Lewin to coincide with
the northern half of what is usually called
the Tyrop&oelig;on&mdash;the part from Damascus
Gate, down to near Wilson's arch. Other
writers identify it with a supposed branch of
the Tyrop&oelig;on, curving to the east across the
Haram. Josephus tells us that when Pompey
beseiged Jerusalem he took up his position
on the <i>north</i> of the temple, in the only
part where an assault was practicable; and
that even there the temple was defended by
high towers, and a trench, <i>and by a deep ravine</i>.
The position which various writers
give to this ravine depends upon their idea
as to the site of the temple. Mr. Fergusson<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
thinks that the valley of the Asamoneans
was a 'tranverse cut, separating the hill Bezetha
from the Akra or citadel, on the temple
hill.' Mr. Thrupp<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> allows a valley on the
north side of the temple, and reminds us
that traces of a valley debouching into the
valley of Kedron, near the middle of the
eastern wall of the Haram, and which seemed
to have been artificially filled up, were detected
by the late Dr. Shultz. Shultz identifies
these traces as those of the valley filled
up by the Asamoneans; but Thrupp holds
him to be mistaken in doing so. Mr.
Sandie<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> puts forth the recognition of such a
valley as the special characteristic of his view
of ancient Jerusalem; but he places it south
of the dome of the rock. He moreover
identifies it with 'the ravine called Kedron'
(<span class="greek" title="t&ecirc;n Kedr&ocirc;na kaloumen&ecirc;n pharanga">&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#922;&#949;&#948;&#961;&#8182;&#957;&#945; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951;&#957; &#966;&#940;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#945;</span>), which
Josephus tells us was overlooked by the
north-east wall of the temple,<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and by which
he does not mean the valley of Kedron,
since he always calls the latter 'Kedron'
simply. Mr. Lewin, again, makes this ravine
to be 'the slip of ground between the
temple and the city wall, reaching from
Bethesda on the north to Ophla on the
south,' <i>i.e.</i>, the eastern side of the present
Haram platform, which is, or was, the west
bank of the present Kedron valley. It is
difficult to see how this could have been a
ravine at all; but Mr. Lewin translates '<i>so-called</i>
Kedron ravine,' and seems to think
the expression implies that Josephus did not
consider the term 'ravine' quite legitimate.
Even if this were so, the illegitimacy of the
designation might result from the circumstance
that what was once a ravine had since
been filled up by the Maccabeans and by
Pompey.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> But we must come to facts.</p>

<p>First of all, Captain Warren tells us that
there was no ravine south of the dome of
the rock, for 'the crest of the rocky spur
runs from the north-west angle of the Dome-of-Rock
platform in a south-east direction to
the triple gate in the south wall; and at
these two points, and in the line between
them, the rock is at the surface.' Secondly,
in December, 1868, when the displacement
of a stone by the rains enabled Captain
Warren to descend beneath the surface of
the Haram, he found a souterrain running
east and west, in the line of the northern
edge of the Mosque platform, the southern
side of it being scarped rock, on which the
wall supporting the northern edge of the
Mosque platform is built, but the rock itself
appearing to 'shelve down rapidly to the
north.' In the following month Captain
Warren ventured to suggest on plan (lithographed
plan 32) the possible course of a
valley coming from the Gate of the Inspector
in the Tyrop&oelig;on, and running past the
north-western corner of the Dome-of-Rock,
out eastward through the Birket Israil (Pool
of Bethesda). The souterrain may, as
Captain Warren observes, be claimed by one
party as the ditch on the northern wall of
the temple, and by another as the northern
ditch of Antonia; and the valley&mdash;which
owes its depth in one part of its course to
what is doubtingly called a 'natural or artificial
ditch'&mdash;will of course be claimed as
that of the Asamoneans.</p>

<p>It is thus, in our opinion, rendered probable
that the ground to the west of that valley
which runs from Damascus Gate constituted
the old town, the <span class="greek" title="phrourion">&#966;&#961;&#959;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span> of David's
time, the upper market-place of the days of
Josephus; that the dome of the rock and
the space to the south of it represent the old
Temple-hill; that to the north of this was
the valley of the Asamoneans; that between
the latter and the valley from Herod's Gate
was the city of David, or Zion,<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
north-east of the last-named valley was
Bezetha. The name Zion got transferred to
the Temple-hill, or was made to include it,
before or during the times of the Maccabees,
probably after the filling-up of the intervening
valley, and in the early centuries of the
Christian era was transferred to the western
hill, which, after the Akra was cut down, was
the highest hill of the city.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Certainly there
is still room for some controversy on these
points, and Captain Warren contributes
something to the discussion, in a long paper
on the 'Comparative Holiness of Mounts
Zion and Moriah,' in which he argues that
Zion was considered holy when the ark was
there, in David's time; that after the ark
(and the holiness) were transferred to Moriah,
the name Zion got transferred also, and
that Josephus refrains from using the term
Zion because he is aware of this confusion.</p>

<p>If the Tyrop&oelig;on valley extended from
Damascus Gate southward, and the city of
David was on the eastern side of it, north of
the temple, then the water which Hezekiah
diverted from its course, and brought down
to the west side of the city of David (2 Chron.
xxxii. 30), and yet <i>into</i> the city of Jerusalem
(2 Kings xx. 20) was probably brought in at
Damascus Gate, and ran towards the Kedron,
either on the west side of the temple, or by
the Maccabean valley, on the northern side.
In the southern half of the Tyrop&oelig;on valley,
outside the west wall of the Haram, Captain
Warren has found, at a depth of seventy or
eighty feet, a rock-cut aqueduct, twelve feet
deep and six feet wide, with round rock-cut
pools at intervals, and shafts which indicate
that pure water was drawn from it. As
Hezekiah brought the stream down from
'the upper watercourse of Gihon,' this discovery
has a direct bearing on the question
of the position of 'the upper pool,' and of
'Gihon, in the valley,'where Solomon was
anointed king; but as the upper part of the
Tyrop&oelig;on has not been excavated, it remains
uncertain whether the water came in by
Damascus Gate or Jaffa Gate, and consequently
what position of Zion is favoured by
the finding of this aqueduct.</p>

<p>The search for the old walls of the city
has only been partially carried out. Here,
again, we have Josephus's explicit description,
and the usual differences among the
commentators.</p>

<p>'The city of Jerusalem was fortified with
three walls, on such parts as were not encompassed
with unpassable valleys; for in such
places it had but one wall....
The old wall began on the north at the
tower called Hippicus, and extended as far
as the Xistus, a place so called, and then,
joining to the Council-house, ended at the
west cloister of the temple. But if we go
the other way westward, it began at the
same place, and extended through a place
called Bethso to the Gate of the Essenes;
and after that it went southward, having its
bending above the fountain Siloam, where it
also bends again towards the east at Solomon's
pool, and reaches as far as a certain
place which they called Ophlas, were it was
joined to the eastern cloister of the temple.
The second wall took its beginning from
that gate which they call Gennath, which
belonged to the first wall; it only encompassed
the northern quarter of the city, and
reached as far as the tower Antonia. The
beginning of the third wall was at the tower
Hippicus, whence it readied as far as the
north quarter of the city, and the tower
Psephinus, and then was so far extended till
it came over against the monuments of Helena
(which Helena was Queen of Adiabene,
the daughter of Izates); it then extended
farther to a great length, and passed by the
sepulchral caverns of the kings, and bent
again at the tower of the corner, at the
monument which is called the monument of
the Fuller, and joined to the old wall at the
ravine called Kedron.'<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>As many writers make the northern part
of the first wall to have run from the Jaffa
Gate eastward, Captain Warren spent some
time in excavating in the Muristan, a large
open space in the city, the old burial-place
of the Knights Hospitallers; but he found
'nothing but confusion in the shape of old
walls running at one another in all directions.'
At Wilson's arch, however, near the Haram
wall, and nearly due east from the Jaffa
Gate, he discovered an old city gateway at a
great depth. If we could find traces of the
tower Hippicus we should come upon the
first and third walls together, and similarly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
the gate Gennath would put us on the line
of the first and second walls. The theories
of some writers compel them to put Hippicus
at the Jaffa Gate, where they think they
see its representative in the present Castle of
David. But we agree with Mr. Fergusson,
that the remains called <i>Kasr Jalud</i> at the
north-west corner of the city suit better with
Josephus's description. To this point Captain
Warren has not yet been able to give
much attention; but the so-called Gennath
Gate was examined both by Wilson and by
Warren, and pronounced by the former to
be of comparatively modern construction, by
the latter to be ancient, 'especially as its
style is Roman.' The gate rests in made
earth.</p>

<p>The Damascus Gate is built of two very
different styles of masonry, one of them apparently
very old; and it suits the views of
several writers, who differ as to the course of
the first wall, that this gate and the portion
of wall immediately east of it should be part
of the second wall of the city.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> At the
Damascus Gate excavation brought to light
'a very ancient wall ten feet six inches in
thickness, built with bevelled stones similar
to those of the Jews' Wailing Place;' but
the wall would seem to be built out of old
materials, since stones of more recent date
were found among them; and at the foot of
the wall lay a stone with a Templar's cross
on it.</p>

<p>The third wall has probably almost or
quite disappeared, for when Hadrian was re-erecting
the walls in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, 136, he would not
think it necessary to go out so far; the population
had diminished, and to construct armour
without, so disproportionate to the
shrunken body within, would have been
simply ridiculous. If any part of the third
wall remained, we might suppose it to be at
the northern part of the present east wall;
but here excavation shows that there has
been 'no destruction of extensive buildings
so far north as St. Stephen's Gate,' that the
wall itself is 'of no very ancient date,' and
that 'of the city wall to the east, the north-east
angle of the Haram area is the first sign
from the northern end of anything ancient
in appearance.'</p>

<p>Perhaps there is here a little room for
error; for where the rock is high, the absence
of much <i>d&eacute;bris</i> may not imply that
there has been no great destruction of
buildings; but simply that the rubbish has
found its way to the valleys or was not suffered
to accumulate.</p>

<p>South of the Haram wall, the hill, which
is now chiefly occupied by small vegetable
gardens, in terraces of six to ten feet high,
must have been at one time covered with
houses, for every shaft sunk brought to light
remains of buildings, drains, scarped and cut
rock, and antiquities of various dates. A
cavern cut out of the rock, appears to have
been at first a dyer's shop and afterwards a
stable, while early Christian glass and pottery
was found in a drain above it. Tradition
relates that St. James was cast over the outer
wall of the temple enclosure, and that 'a
fuller took the club with which he pressed
the clothes, and brought it down on the
head of the just one.' This hill is frequently
identified with Ophel, where Jotham and
Manasseh built (2 Chron. xxvii. 3; xxxiii.
14; Neh, iii. 26, 27; xi. 21), though whether
Ophel referred to the whole of the swelling
hill or to a tumour-like tower in some
part of it was not certain.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> In this district
Warren has discovered a massive wall, from
twelve to fourteen feet thick, which abuts
on the Haram wall (but does not bond into
it) at a point twelve feet six inches west of
the south-east angle of the Haram, which
runs first of all sixty feet due south, and
then takes a bend to the south-west, in which
direction it runs for 700 feet, and then ends
abruptly. The wall is still from forty to
sixty feet in height, and the rock is scarped
for thirty feet below it, while solid towers
of masonry are found at intervals along its
course. This discovery will have to be taken
into consideration by those who bring the
south wall of the city up from Siloam, and
make it join the third wall at a point 600
feet from the south-west angle of the present
Haram, and therefore more than 300
feet from the point where this wall abuts.
The curious rock-cut connection which Warren
found between the Virgin's Fount and
a shaft opening from Ophel, would seem to
be a device for supplying the inhabitants of
this district with water, in a secret way; reminding
us of the work of Hezekiah, and
possibly being of the same date.</p>

<p>A question of paramount interest is the
site of the successive temples of Solomon,
Zerubabel and Herod. It is universally allowed
that the temple stood on that hill
which we call Moriah, and within the present
sacred area; but while Josephus describes
it as a square of 600 feet (1 stadium),
in the side, the dimensions of the Haram
are, according to Catherwood, 1,520 feet on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
the east side, 1,617 feet on the west, 1,020
on the north, and 932 on the south. The
way being thus open for conjecture, we have
had the usual differences of opinion, and
the temple has been variously placed at the
south-west angle, the centre of the area, the
southern half of the area, the northern half,
or has even been made coincident with
the entire Haram. A few shafts and galleries
would probably settle this question,
and in showing us the foundations of
the temple, give us the key to most of the
old topography; but unfortunately the reservation
made by the Turkish Government
has compelled Captain Warren to labour
only outside the enclosure. Still, as there
was reason to think that one or more of the
Haram walls or angles might coincide in
position with those of the temple, there was
room for discovery by exterior examination.
The theory of Catherwood and of De
Vog&uuml;&eacute;, that the whole of the area belonged
to the temple, may be dismissed as being
inconsistent with the measurements of Josephus.
The discovery of the transverse valley
and of the prolongation of the valley
from Herod's Gate appear to be fatal to
Williams's view, that the temple stood in the
northern half of the Haram and stretched
all across it.</p>

<p>A favourite theory is that of Fergusson,
Lewin, and others, that the temple occupied
the south-west angle of the area, its south
and west walls coinciding with those of the
Haram for a distance of 600 feet from the
corner. The chief positive evidence for
this view consists in the fact that the south-west
angle is the only right angle of the
present walls, that some of the stones existing
in that part of the wall to-day are so
immense as to justify Josephus's description
of stones 'immovable for all time' and that
the spring stones of an arch discovered by
Robinson in the western wall, commencing
about forty feet from the south-west angle,
would be in the centre of the great Stoa
Basilica of the temple. This cloister, according
to the Jewish historian, was on the
south wall, overhanging the valley, and communicated
by steps with the upper city.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
The arch of Robinson was often assumed to
be the first of a series, and 'Robinson's
bridge or viaduct' was attributed by Lewin
to Solomon, and identified as that which
was broken away by the followers of Aristobulus,
in Pompey's time.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Signor Pierotti
had scratched up a few feet of earth, and
not finding any trace of a pier, declared that
there could not have been a bridge. The
excavations of Capt. Warren have shown
that the south-west angle of the Haram is
buried for about ninety feet, while in the
Tyrop&oelig;on valley the rock from the western
side rather rises than falls until it is within
200 feet of the sanctuary wall, and then
shelves down very rapidly. The actual pier
of an arch has been discovered, with three
courses of stones <i>in situ</i>, twelve feet two
inches in thickness, commencing at forty-one
feet six inches from the wall, within a few
inches of the span assigned by Robinson.
The length of the spring-stones is given by
Wilson as fifty feet, and the pier is found to
measure fifty-one feet six inches, and has
its northern end eighty-nine feet from the
south-west angle, nearly corresponding to
the spring stones. The stones of the pier
are precisely similar to those of the south-west
angle, and presumably of the same
age; but the inference that they are therefore
of the age of Solomon is checked by
the next discovery. Stretching between the
pier and the sanctuary wall is a pavement, on
which some of the fallen voussoirs of the
arch are resting, but underneath the pavement
are twenty-three feet of <i>d&eacute;bris</i>, covering
two older voussoirs, which have crushed
into the arched roof of an aqueduct which
may be older still&mdash;the aqueduct previously
spoken of in connexion with Hezekiah.
These historical <i>strata</i> seem to yield evidence
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The winding rock-cut aqueduct was
constructed.</p>

<p>2. The west Haram wall was afterwards
built, the aqueduct arched over, and a bridge
thrown across from the Haram area to the
western side of the valley.</p>

<p>3. The arch of the bridge fell (two voussoirs
still remain), smashing in part of the
arch of the aqueduct.</p>

<p>4. <i>D&eacute;bris</i> began to fill up the valley, a
pavement was constructed upon it, which
still remains, about twenty feet above the
top of the aqueduct; and shafts were constructed
at intervals from the pavement
down to the aqueduct, in order to obtain
water readily. Another arch was built.</p>

<p>5. The arch fell, and now rests upon the
pavement.</p>

<p>6. <i>D&eacute;bris</i> began to fill up the valley over
the fallen arch, the pier of which standing
out was removed, all except the three lowest
courses.</p>

<p>7. Houses were built on a level twenty
feet above the pavement.</p>

<p>8. These houses fell into ruin and the <i>d&eacute;bris</i>
accumulated to its present level, viz.,
forty-five feet above the pavement.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>

<p>No remains of any second arch of the
supposed viaduct have been found; but
three arches with a staircase to west would
have sufficed to bridge the gulf, and there
does exist a colonnade in ruins in continuation
of the line of Robinson's arch. It is
part of the view which places the temple at
the south-west angle, that the three other
gates and roadways mentioned by Josephus
as connecting its west side with the city and
suburbs<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> should be traceable between Robinson's
arch and a point 600 feet from the
south-west angle. The first of these gates&mdash;apparently
the most northern&mdash;'led to the
king's palace, and went to a passage over
the intermediate valley.' It is remarkable
that at a distance of 600 feet from the
south-west angle we have a causeway which
crosses the valley, while from this point the
western wall no longer follows the same direction,
but inclines slightly to the westward.
This causeway commences with an arch
nearly as large as Robinson's, discovered by
Dr. Barclay, of the United States, measured
by Captain Wilson, and known as Wilson's
arch. This arch is now found to be in a
perfect condition and elevated 120 feet
above the lowest part of the valley, while
the causeway to west is a succession of
vaults on vaults, and is about eighty feet
above the rock. The passage&mdash;the way to
the king's palace&mdash;has also apparently come
to light in the form of a secret tunnel, which
has been traced westward for 250 feet, at
which point it is under the house of Joseph
Effendi, and is used as a cistern.</p>

<p>Of the two intermediate gates, the southern
should be by calculation 264 feet from
the south-west angle of the Haram area;
and at 270 feet there is in the Haram wall
an enormous lintel, which was first brought
prominently into notice in this century by
Dr. Barclay, in his 'City of the Great
King.' The bottom of the lintel is five
feet five inches above the surface of the
ground, and Warren has ascertained that the
sill is about thirty feet below the lintel,
while the road up to it seems to have been
by a causeway raised forty-six feet above
the rock. We have, then, in the western
portion of the Haram wall two bridges and
one gate; but the most persevering search
has not been rewarded by the discovery of
any second gate between the two bridges.
Moreover, the spring of Wilson's arch is
seven feet above that of Robinson, its pier
is for the first nineteen feet built up of
rough blocks (that of Robinson's of smooth
stones), and the voussoirs are of a style said
to be of the later days of the Roman empire;
though, like the more southern arch,
it appears to have had a predecessor on the
same spot.</p>

<p>Of the new evidence furnished by the explorations,
the balance seems, after all, to
tell against the south-west angle as the site
of the temple. It has already been stated
that the original bed of the Tyrop&oelig;on valley
comes out through the south wall of the
Haram, about sixty feet from the south-west
angle; and it is only stating the fact in
other words to say that for sixty feet the
south wall is carried up the slope of the
modern Mount Zion. In the other direction,
if we measure off 600 feet from the south-west
angle, to find the south-east corner of
the temple, the wall at that point rests on
the highest part of Mount Moriah, which is
not cut by the south front at all. An examination
of the lithographed plan, No. 14,
makes such a position seem an unlikely one
for the original wall; for it would be more
like building in the valley than on the hill,
would take more material, and be destitute
of symmetry. Next, the rock-cut aqueduct
running down the Tyrop&oelig;on has one of its
pools half cut through by the west wall;
and the north part of the aqueduct, roofed
with flat slabs, appears to be older than the
south, which is vaulted; everything favouring
the conclusion that the aqueduct originally
followed the course of the valley, and
that when the wall was built the part of the
aqueduct lying outside of it was left intact,
and new lines of arched passage built to
connect the older portions. Unless, therefore,
the aqueduct is of pre-Solomonian age,
the west wall was no part of Solomon's
Temple at least, though it may have been
included in Herod's.</p>

<p>Add to all this, that the stones at the
south-west angle resemble those at the north-east,
and that a temple in the south-west
angle would not face due east, and the
evidence in favour of this position is by no
means conclusive.</p>

<p>The courses of stone in the south wall
usually run from three feet six inches to
three feet nine inches in height; but between
the Double Gate and the Triple Gate there
is a course described by Captain Wilson,
from five feet ten inches to six feet one inch
high. Captain Warren found that this
course, with some breaks, is continued to
the south-east angle, and thence runs north
along the east wall for twenty-four feet.
The length of this course in the south wall
is 600 feet; and the coincidence of this
number with the measurement of the temple
cloisters, is enough to suggest that we may
here have a clue, especially since, through
the rising ground under the Triple Gate,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
this is the first course of stones which could
be carried uninterruptedly through from
east to west. Captain Warren, following
this clue, not only found, after numerous
examinations underground, that a perpendicular
dropped from the most westerly stone
of this course would pretty well divide the
wall into two parts of different character, but
that the rough stones to the west of this line
resemble those at the north-east angle, thus
far favouring the conclusion that these were
the parts added by Herod.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>The Triple Gate is in the middle of this
six feet course of stones, thus agreeing with
the description of Josephus, that the south
front of the temple had 'gates in its middle,'
an expression which some have tried
to reconcile with the existence of the Huldah
and Triple Gates, at about equal distances
from the angles and from one another,
or have construed as applying to the Huldah
Gate alone, which is, however, 365 feet from
the south-west angle.</p>

<p>Under the Triple Gate the rock, as already
stated, is highest, and notwithstanding that
the slope is greater to the east than to the
west, there would thus be an appearance of
symmetry in the wall which it could not
have if standing entirely west of the Triple
Gate. It is worth notice also that at the
Huldah Gate, where, on this view, the temple
would terminate to west, the wall of the
city, coming up from the south, now abuts,
indicating that the south-west angle of the
Haram is less ancient than the original city
wall at this part, and the city wall less
ancient than the south Haram wall east of
Huldah Gate.</p>

<p>Again, the wall of Ophel, which commences
at the south-east angle, and thus
favours the view we are considering, runs
sixty feet south, then 700 feet south-west,
and terminates abruptly at a point nearly
due south of Huldah Gate (see lithographic
plan, No. 30), to which, it would seem possible,
its return course may have run. Even
Fergusson's argument for the south-west
angle&mdash;that the south wall of the platform
which now surrounds the Mosque of Omar
runs parallel to the south wall of the Haram,
at a distance of exactly 600 feet, and for
a length of 600 feet&mdash;is nearly as much in
favour of the south-east angle; and Lewin's
argument that Josephus's <span class="greek" title="pulas kata meson">&#960;&#973;&#955;&#945;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#956;&#941;&#963;&#959;&#957;</span>
must refer to a double doorway, and therefore
to the present Huldah Gate, is balanced
by Warren's discovery that originally the
so-called Triple Gate was a double tunnel.</p>

<p>It is often urged that the sub-structures
known as Solomon's stables, in the south-east
corner of the Haram, are of too slight
a construction to bear the cloisters of the
temple, and too modern, as well as too
slight;<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> but the floor of these vaults is on a
level with the six feet course of stones previously
mentioned&mdash;above which level few
stones remain <i>in situ</i>&mdash;and any previous
sub-structures would not have survived the
destruction of the east and south retaining
walls. Between the Triple Gate and the
south-east angle is the postern known as the
Single Gate, with its sill on a level with the
sill of the Triple Gate, but itself of modern
construction. Below this gate, and below
the vaults within the Haram, at this corner,
Warren discovered a passage for carrying
into the Kedron some liquid, and yet wholly
distinct from the water channels under the
Triple Gate. Underground Jerusalem so
abounds in aqueducts and passages that it
would not be of much force to urge that this
channel conveyed the blood from the altar:
yet the suggestion may be set against any
similar one in favour of another site.</p>

<p>Finally, on this point, at the south-east
angle, which some had thought to be modern,
the foundations are about eighty feet beneath
the surface, the stones are <i>in situ</i>, and some
of them have Ph&oelig;nician masons' marks
painted and chiselled on them. That the
stones are <i>in situ</i> is proved by the circumstance
that a small depth of <i>d&eacute;bris</i>, which
had been shovelled away to make room for
the lowest tier, still remains close by,
and has its layers <i>sloping inwards</i>. That
the wall is ancient is thought to be evidenced
by the Ph&oelig;nician characters, which seem
certainly to point to pre-Roman times, and
possibly to the time when Solomon engaged
the workmen of Hiram, King of Tyre, to
build the temple.</p>

<p>Still, neither is the evidence conclusive
here. While the stones at the north-east
angle differ from those at the south-east,
and there are several breaks and irregularities
in the masonry of the east wall, Ph&oelig;nician
marks&mdash;though too much blurred to be
deciphered&mdash;are found at the north-east
angle also; the south-east angle is not a
right angle, but measures 92 deg. 5 min. at
the surface, and 92 deg. 25 min. at the
foundation; at 105 feet from the corner
there is a break in the character of the
masonry; only the first 120 feet of wall are
in the same straight line, and then there is
a bend to the north-east.</p>

<p>The platform, called the Haram area, is
nearly on one level all over, and near its
centre is a second platform, about eighteen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
feet higher, on which stands the Mosque of
Omar, covering the Sakhra, or sacred rock of
the Mahometans, which measures sixty feet
by fifty or fifty-five, and is said by them to
be a morsel of Paradise. Thrupp and Falconer
suppose it to be the rock or part of the
rock on which stood the tower of Antonia; Fergusson
maintains it to be the Holy Sepulchre,
over which Constantine built a church, and
Professor Willis identifies it with the threshing-floor
of Araunah, and therefore with the
site of the temple. As this rock is the highest
point of Mount Moriah, and contains a cave
with an opening to a deeper recess which
has not been explored, it was sure thus to
suggest itself as the place of the altar whence,
according to the Talmud, the blood and
offal of the sacrifices were drained off to the
Kedron. As excavations have not been
permitted within the sacred area, it has not
been possible to put this theory to any test;
nor can Warren's accidental discovery of
souterrains along the northern edge of the
platform, and of a natural or artificial ditch
crossing beyond its north-west corner, be
considered as settling the point either way.
It may be worth a thought that the summit
of Moriah may have been a 'high place'
for heathen worship before it occurred to
David to build a temple for God; that on
that very account it would perhaps be <i>avoided</i>
by the builders of the temple; and that if
Araunah worshipped on any high place at
all, his threshing-floor would not be on the
same spot.</p>

<p>Captain Warren is never forward to
theorise, but as a provisional hypothesis
during his earlier excavations he favoured
the south-east angle as the probable site of
the temple; and now, after three or four
years of investigation, while he has come to
no conclusion, he inclines to a position
nearly coincident with the Dome-of-Rock
platform. As Josephus states the stones in
Solomon's Cloister&mdash;the eastern side of the
temple&mdash;to have been twenty cubits long
and six cubits high, and Warren has not
found any stones of these dimensions at any
point where he has explored, he naturally
thinks the cloister may be in the part he
has not explored, viz., a space of 600 feet
between the Golden Gate and the south-east
angle, where a wide Mahometan cemetery
makes operations very difficult.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'Place the temple here, nearly coinciding
with the Dome-of-the Rock Platform, and it
appears to suit exactly. It has the valley to
the north; it has the raised platform of the
dome of the rock, which is just about the
height of the inner court above the outer; it
has the unexplored 600 feet of wall south of
the Golden Gate, and overlooking the Kedron.
But it will be asked, "What about the south-east
angle, with its sub-structures and its walls,
with Ph&oelig;nician characters inscribed thereon?"
I think it was Solomon's palace.'</p>
</div>
<p>One of the objects of the Palestine Exploration
Fund is to improve our knowledge
of Jewish arch&aelig;ology, about which we
have known next to nothing. The discoveries
in Assyria show us what may be expected;
'for not only have we been able (says
Mr. Layard) through the discoveries of Sir
Henry Rawlinson, Dr. Hincks, and others
(Mr. Layard might have added his own
name), to read their written history, and
trace their connection with other nations and
races, but by the aid of the sculptures we can
almost learn the details of the private and
domestic life of the Assyrian people&mdash;their
dress, their arms, and their religious ceremonies.'
If similar discoveries could be
made in Palestine, the greatest light would
be thrown upon the political and domestic
history of the Jews, and most important
illustrations of the Holy Scriptures would
be obtained. Such discoveries are indeed
considered unlikely, since the Jewish law
forbade the representation of the human
form in sculpture or painting; but the Jews
did not always scrupulously observe their
law; besides which, the objection does not
relate to the discovery of pottery, glass,
coins, metal work, remains of architecture,
&amp;c. It must be confessed, indeed, that the
legendary golden throne of King Solomon,
with its eagles, and lions, and doves, has
not been found, and the sceptres of the
kings of Judah and Israel have not even
been searched for by the explorers; moreover,
most of their labour has been expended
in uncovering massive structures, which
cannot be brought home; yet still, when
Mr. Macgregor returned from Jerusalem, he
brought with him nine cases of objects incidentally
lighted upon by the excavators, and
in the summer of 1869 the Society was able
to open a Museum of Palestinean Antiquities.
The collection included lamps, pottery,
glass, coins, weapons, tesselated pavement,
sculpture, sarcophagi, geological specimens,
and a collection of stone weights; besides
photographs, and tracings, maps, and models.
Three glass lamps, of curious construction,
with several brigs of red pottery, and a
cooking dish, glazed inside, were found in
the rock-cut chambers and passages leading
from the Virgin's Fountain up through the
hill of Ophel. The whole of the ground of
Ophel, between the south Haram wall and
the Pool of Siloam, has been built over, and
lamps of a particular type have been found
there&mdash;two of them with Greek inscriptions&mdash;and
in no case has any known Arabic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
pottery been found. On the other hand, at
the Birket Israil&mdash;so-called Pool of Bethesda,
where Warren dug through thirty-five feet
of rubbish, and brought up a piece of the
concrete bottom&mdash;the pottery is totally different.
It is in many cases highly glazed,
and has patterns on it, and when it is unglazed
it has bands of red or brown, or
other marks, very similar in appearance to
the specimens of pottery found at Athens
and Melos; and yet among this there came
to light two pieces of glazed jars with raised
Arabic or Cufic inscriptions, one of them
being the usual invocation to Allah.</p>

<p>Some of the pottery found is older than
the south-east portion of the Haram wall, for
on the rock there rests an accumulation of
eight or ten feet of a clay mould, which,
from its slope, appears to have been cut
through for the purpose of laying the stones
on a solid foundation, and this clay abounds
in pottery, broken into fragments. The
rock at the south-east angle is very soft for
the first two or three feet of depth, and at
three feet to the east of the angle a hole
was found scooped out of it, one foot in
diameter and one foot in depth, in which was a
little earthenware jar, standing upright, as
though it had been purposely placed there.
Warren suggested at the time (February,
1869) that the purpose may have been religious
or superstitious, and that in such
cases inscriptions might be found upon the
pottery, if the jars were properly cleaned.
The suggestion has borne fruit in his own
experience. Among the fragments of pottery
which for a depth of about two inches
covers the rich loam overlying the rock at
the south-east angle some handles of jars
were observed to have a stamp on them, and
on this account some specimens were collected.
After his return to England, in
1870, Captain Warren, getting these out,
and dusting the mud off them, observed
Ph&oelig;nician letters, some of which have since
been read by Dr. Birch, of the British Museum,
as <i>lemelek Zepha</i> (to the king Zepha),
and which exactly resemble those of the
Moabite stone, of which all the world has
heard. The significance of this discovery
will be better understood after we have considered
that of the Moabite stone itself.</p>

<p>The paleographical results achieved by the
Palestine Exploration Fund, when viewed by
the side of the many and varied works in
other departments, may seem to be small;
but Mr. Deutsch, when speaking at Oxford,<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
was not wrong in desiring his hearers to
count the latter, but to weigh the former.
In a minaret near Nablus, immured upside
down, is an inscribed slab that once belonged
to a synagogue, which, though it
does not seem to have been seen by Robinson,
was copied by Shultz in 1844, and published
by R&ouml;diger; and again copied by
Wildenbruck, and published by Blau. Finally,
in 1860, it was copied and explained
by Rosen, whose work left that of his predecessors
far behind. Yet even he does not
give all the characters, nor are they so accurately
reproduced as would seem to be absolutely
necessary in the case of the oldest
known Samaritan monument; nor has he
been able more than to conjecture as to the
reading of the very beginning of the tablet.
A photograph, taken under Captain Wilson,
has rendered everything clear, and it turns
out that, owing to the difficulty of the position
in which the decipherer is necessarily
placed, it was utterly impossible to perceive
certain marks on the stone itself which are
quite clear in the photograph. The tablet
itself exhibits ten lines, the first eight of
which contain the Ten Commandments, according
to the Samaritan recension, in an
abbreviated form. The ninth forms a portion
of the celebrated Samaritan interpolation
after the Ten Commandments (from
Deut. xxvii. 2&mdash;7; and ix. 30)&mdash;'And it
shall be on the day when ye shall pass over
Jordan ... on Mount Gerizim ...
<i>and thou shalt build there an altar unto the
Lord thy God</i>.' The last line contains the
formula from Exodus, of frequent use in Samaritan
worship, viz., 'Arise, O Lord; return,
O Lord!'<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Another photograph gives
the famous inscription on the lintel of a
ruined synagogue at Kefr Birim, in Galilee,
with greater clearness than is represented in
M. Renan's lithograph, taken from a cast, and
is even clearer than the original itself, certain
blurred characters of which it was next
to impossible to distinguish on the glaring
white surface. The gist of the inscription is
a prayer for 'peace upon this place and all
the places of Israel,' and an indication of the
builder's name. In addition to these, some
dozens of inscriptions have been copied&mdash;in
the north of Palestine by Wilson; at Jerash
and in the Lebanon by Warren; and in the
Haram area and elsewhere by Mr. E. H.
Palmer. Ancient characters have been ferreted
out, and copied from the walls of
Sidon; and a seal, bearing the inscription,
'Haggai, son of Shebaniah,' and dating as
far back as the Maccabean period, has been
found under the buried pavement near the
south-west corner of the Haram.
The red-paint characters at the south-east
angle of the Haram were examined by Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
Deutsch on the spot, and pronounced to be
partly letters, partly numerals, and partly
special masons' or quarry signs. Some of
them were recognisable at once as well-known
Ph&oelig;nician characters; others, hitherto
unknown in Ph&oelig;nician epigraphy, Mr.
Deutsch had the rare satisfaction of being
able to identify on absolutely undoubted antique
Ph&oelig;nician structures in Syria, such as
the primitive sub-structures of the harbour
at Sidon. Similar marks at the north-east
angle afford evidence that the stones of the
Haram wall were shaped at the quarry, inasmuch
as the paint in one instance has run,
and the trickling is upwards with reference to
the present position of the stone. Evidence
to the same effect is furnished by the marginal
drafts, which, present no appearance of
pattern or design when the wall is regarded
as a whole, but only when each stone is
taken by itself.</p>

<p>The paleographic discovery of paramount
interest is that of the Moabite stone, with a
memorial inscription in what is known to
scholars as the 'Ph&oelig;nician' character, and
belonging, there is little doubt, to the first
half of the ninth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> In August,
1868, the Rev. F. A. Klein, a Prussian clergyman,
in the service of the Church Missionary
Society at Jerusalem, in the course of a
journey from es-Salt to Kerak, had the good
fortune to be shown this monument at
Dhib&acirc;n near Arnon, the old border of Moab.
The stone was lying among the ruins, perfectly
free and exposed to view, the inscription
uppermost, and was in excellent preservation.
Mr. Klein ascertained it to be one
metre thirteen centimetres in height, seventy
centimetres in breadth and thirty-five in
thickness, rounded at the upper and lower
corners,<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and containing thirty-four lines of
writing. Circumstances prevented his copying
more than 'a few words from several
lines at random;' and when afterwards M.
Clermont-Ganneau, of the French Consulate
at Jerusalem, Captain Warren, of the Palestine
Exploration Fund, and others, interested
themselves to obtain 'squeezes,' the Arabs
resented the action of foreigners, quarrelled
among themselves, and lighting a fire about
the stone poured water on it and broke it to
pieces. An Arab employed by M. Ganneau,
who when the quarrel arose was engaged in
taking a squeeze, tore off the wet impression
in rags, and springing on his horse managed
to escape, though not without a spear wound
in his leg. Through the energy of Captain
Warren and M. Ganneau better squeezes
were afterwards obtained of the larger fragments,
and at a later date the fragments
themselves came to hand, so that of 1,000
letters which it is estimated the stone contained,
669 have been recovered.</p>

<p>While the materials remain imperfect, it
is impossible to obtain a complete translation
of the inscription, though various attempts
have been made. M. Ganneau's second
translation of June, 1870, differs widely
from that which he put forth five months
previously; but then his only copy of certain
parts of the stone was certain torn rags
(<i>lambeaux frif&eacute;s et chiffonn&eacute;s</i>), and his method
of procedure with the fragments of the
stone is thus described:&mdash;'La plus grande
partie de ces morceaux, m&ecirc;me les plus minimes,
peut &ecirc;tre mise en place facilement, en
tenant compte de la correspondance horizontale
et verticale des s&eacute;ries de caract&egrave;res:
il suffit de proc&eacute;der comme pour d&eacute;terminer
la position g&eacute;ographique d'un point par
l'intersection des lignes de longitude et de
latitude.'<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Translations have also been attempted
by Professor Schlottman, of Halle,
Professor N&ouml;ldeke, and in this country by
Dr. Neubauer; while Mr. Deutsch has consistently
asked scholars and the public to exercise
patience and wait till the full materials
for a translation should come to hand. The
general drift of the inscription, however, is
clear enough. It appears to be a contemporaneous
record from the Moabite point of
view of 2 Kings i. 1, set up by King Mesha,
commencing with a brief record of himself
and his father, commemorating warlike successes
over the Israelites, explaining how he
rebuilt and improved a number of well-known
Moabite cities, and finishing apparently
with some further reference to war.
The names of Israel, Omri, Chemosh, occur
up and down, and the monarch seems to
have conceived himself under the special
guidance of his god, who was thought to
signify his will that this or that city should
be attacked, and who was obeyed implicitly.
Historically, therefore, the monument is interesting,
since it is an unexpected record of
a nation now passed away, and adds a trifle
to our knowledge.</p>

<p>Paleographically, the stone is of far greater
value, and happily of nearly as much value
in its mutilated condition, as it would have
been if perfect. It is the very oldest Semitic
lapidary record of importance yet discovered,
the most ancient specimen of the
alphabetic writing still in common use
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
amongst us&mdash;a century and a half earlier
than any other inscription in the same Ph&oelig;nician
character, and three centuries earlier
than any other such inscription of any length.
Its significance in this respect is, however,
only in process of being studied, and uniformity
of opinion has not yet been arrived
at. The names of the Hebrew letters are all
significant of certain objects&mdash;<i>aleph</i>, <i>b&ecirc;th</i>,
<i>gimel</i>, <i>daleth</i>, for instance = ox, house, camel,
door, &amp;c.; and it has been maintained by
Semitic scholars that the letters themselves
were originally slight and abridged representations
of the visible objects, the resemblance
being more clearly seen in the older Ph&oelig;nician
than in the later Ph&oelig;nician, the Assyrian
or square character, and archaic
Greek.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Mr. Deutsch, who was so careful in
the matter of translation, was bold to express
himself here, and to assert from the
evidence of the Moabite stone that 'the more
primitive the characters the <i>simpler</i> they become;
not, as often supposed, the more complicated,
as more in accordance with some pictorial
prototype.'<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> This view is controverted
by Professor Rawlinson, in the <i>Contemporary
Review</i> for August, 1870, and, as it appears
to us, successfully; for while the later characters
in some instances present a greater
complication to the eye, they are far simpler
to the mind as soon as you imagine yourself
engaged in writing them and exerting
the volition separately for each stroke. 'In
<i>samech</i> for instance, apparently the most
complicated of the later letters, a gradual
diminution in the number of strokes may be
traced from first to last. Originally the letter
was written like an early Greek <i>xi</i>&mdash;thus,
(<img src="images/chara.png" width="11" height="18" alt="character a" />),
with four distinct strokes; then the four
were reduced to two by changing the three
horizontal bars into a zigzag, which could be
written without taking the hand from the
paper, and adding a vertical bar beneath it;
finally, the vertical bar was attached to one
end of the zigzag, and thus made a continuation
of it, so that a single continuous stroke
sufficed for the whole letter....
In like manner, the original <i>zain</i> required
three distinct strokes, two horizontal and one
oblique (
<img src="images/charb.png" width="18" height="13" alt="character b"  />),
 which were subsequently represented
by the form still in use (Z), a form
producible by a single effort, without any removal
of the pen from the paper.'</p>

<p>And so with regard to the pictorial origin
of the letters. The early <i>b&ecirc;th</i> differs from
the later solely in having a pointed head instead
of a rounded one. But the object
which <i>b&ecirc;th</i> was intended to represent was a
tent, the earliest 'house' of pastoral man; and
this had in primitive times the simple triangular
form, &#916;. Thus the early <i>b&ecirc;th</i> more
resembled the object than the later one. The
early <i>daleth</i> is a simple triangle; the later
has the right side of the triangle elongated,
and the other two generally rounded into
one. But <i>daleth</i>, 'door,' represented the
opening of a tent, the form of which was
like that of the tent, triangular. For other
instances we must refer our readers to Professor
Rawlinson's paper and the plate
which accompanies it, merely remarking in
the way of adverse criticism that the square
letters of the Old Testament present a difficulty,
since, while they are confessedly of
later origin, such letters as <i>b&ecirc;th</i>, <i>gimel</i>, <i>zain</i>,
<i>ain</i>, <i>kaph</i>, <i>shin</i>, are less simple in the sense
explained, than the older. The Moabite
stone also throws light on the question of
the time at which writing was introduced
into Greece, the Greek alphabet of the
earliest inscriptions (circ. <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 650-500) resembling
that of the Moabite stone more
closely than it does any later alphabet; so
that Mr. Grote's opinion that letters were
unknown to the Greeks of Homer's time,
and Hesiod's, is in danger of being proved
incorrect.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that a stone measuring
three feet six inches in length and with thirty-four
lines of writing on it should have escaped
notice until the year 1868; but since
Irby and Mangles visited Moab in 1809,
scarcely any European traveller has passed
near the spot where this monument was
found; so that it has been said that the chief
value of this discovery is in the prospect it
affords of future successful exploration.
It should be remembered that the Arabs
are now aware of the price Europeans are
willing to pay for such relics, and would no
doubt bring others forward if they knew
of any existing. Mr. E. H. Palmer, who was
in the country in the spring of 1870, is probably
right in his conclusion that above
ground at least there does not exist another
Moabite stone. But there are more fishes in
the sea than have ever yet been caught; and
if a few intelligent men accustomed to dealing
with lawless Arabs could be sent out to
Moab to conduct excavations, they might,
if liberally supplied with money and other
resources, obtain antiquities of great value,
inscriptions possibly included. Dean Stanley
points us also to 1 Sam. xv. 12, describing
Saul's victory over the Amalekites, where
it is said, 'Saul came to Carmel, and behold
he set him up a place' (&#1502;&#1463;&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1490; which is from
the root &#1504;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1490;, <i>to set</i>, <i>to put</i>; in the Hiphil to
make to stand, and which might be translated
<i>pillar</i> or <i>trophy</i>)&mdash;the Dean points to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
this to show the possibility of even Jewish
inscriptions coming to light.</p>

<p>To return to the characters at the south-east
angle of the Haram&mdash;on the wall and on
the handles of the jars or vases. The letters
on the pottery are like those of the Moabite
stone; whence the age of the jars is inferred
to be about the same, and their origin
Ph&oelig;nician: the position of the pottery shows
it to be of nearly the same age as the wall,
and hence the antiquity of the wall is deduced;
the wall itself shows Ph&oelig;nician
marks, and so the builders are believed to
have been Ph&oelig;nicians. This seems to us a
little too hasty. The Moabite stone gives us
the <i>Moabite</i> alphabet of King Mesha's time,
which proves to be identical with that of
old Ph&oelig;nicia. Judea was geographically as
near to Ph&oelig;nicia as Moab was, and probably
used the same alphabet, a supposition confirmed
by the discovery of vase handles at
Jerusalem with letters like those of the Moabite
stone. It seems gratuitous to conclude
that these vases were among the contents of
a museum or were ever the property of Ph&oelig;nicians,
when the evidence goes to show
that the language inscribed on them was
common to all the races of Western Asia.
Only for want of a better name has it been
called 'Ph&oelig;nician;' and Mr. Deutsch had
already suggested the term 'Cadmean,'
while Sir Henry Rawlinson had ventured
the prediction that, should any early monument
be found at Jerusalem, its inscription
would be in this character. The Ph&oelig;nician
character was probably the only cursive character
used by the Semitic nations, and the
Hebrew character, Sir Henry believes, did
not exist till after the return from the captivity.
The vase handles therefore show us the
kind of letters used by the Hebrew prophets,
and the Cadmean masons' marks neither
prove nor disprove the Ph&oelig;nician origin of
the Haram wall; but the identity of the
vase-handle letters with those of the Moabite
stone rather than with the alphabet of
Assyrian tablets and gems, or of the inscription
on the tomb of Eshmunazer (circ. <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
600) indicates the great antiquity both of
the pottery and the south-east Haram wall.
On this point we may add that we have
compared (from the photographs) the letters
of the vase-handles with those of the Moabite
stone, and find the identity very apparent in
the case of the <i>tau</i>, <i>shin</i>, <i>kaph</i> and <i>mem</i>.</p>

<p>The work promised by the Fund in
the departments of natural history and
geology still waits for want of means;
though notes have been made on the occurrence
of basalt, trap, hot springs, &amp;c., and
among the things sent home have been an
occasional animal, a small collection of <i>Coleoptera</i>,
a book of dried flowers from Moab,
and some specimens of rock. In its zoology
and botany, as well as in its human history
and arts, Palestine has felt the influence
of Africa, Asia and Europe; the heights of
Lebanon and Hermon, the depths of Gennesareth
and the Dead Sea, assist to make its
natural history cosmopolitan. It is curious
that the <i>Clarias</i>, a strange-looking fish of the
Siluroid family, found by Tristram in the
Lake of Galilee, and in one of the fountains
near its shores, should be identical in species
with a fish found in the Nile; thus far confirming
Josephus, who says that the fountain
of Capharnaum in Gennesareth produced a
Nile fish, and on that account was thought
to be a vein of the river of Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> But
the words of Linn&aelig;us are almost true to-day:
'We know more of the botany and zoology of
farther India than we do of those of Palestine.'
Of the geology we are in equal ignorance,
although the depression of the Jordan
Valley and Dead Sea invites attention as
being the most remarkable on the face of the
globe, and constituting, in the opinion of Sir
R. Murchison, the key to the entire geology
of the district. Mr. Prestwich, Mr. Tristram,
and a few other gentlemen, if sent out and
supported for some years, would probably
astonish us by the results of their investigations.
In meteorology the Society has made
a commencement, by sending out instruments
and publishing tabular statements of
barometrical readings, temperature, rainfall,
&amp;c., observed at Beyrout, Nazareth, Gaza,
Jaffa, and in the Lebanon. With all this
work on hand, they have also begun the exploration
of the Tih&mdash;the Wilderness of the
Wanderings&mdash;sending out Mr. E. H. Palmer,
a most accomplished Arabic scholar,
formerly of the Sinai Ordnance Survey, who
appears to have made some discoveries, but
whose full statement is not yet before us.</p>

<p>We had intended to detail the difficulties
under which the explorers have done their
work, but the list is too long: counting every
shade, from the laziness of the native workmen,
to the whizzing of native bullets; from
the thermometer at 110 degrees to attacks
of fever and dysentery; from slips in scaling
mountains, danger from falling stones,
risk of choking in narrow aqueducts and
sewers&mdash;we had noted not less than fifty
instances.</p>

<p>We are bound to say that the Society has
made a good beginning; that it has done
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
fully as much as could be expected under all
the circumstances, and with its inadequate
funds; and that if it be not well supported
for another five years it will be to the lasting
disgrace of England. In its scientific and
its religions aims, in its practical and its unsectarian
character, it suits the present age;
supplying facts for theorists, illustrating
points of Scripture history, and confirming
the general truth of the Bible.</p>

<p>Besides the completion of the work at
Jerusalem, much remains to be done, not
only in natural history and geology, but in
the observation of manners and customs, exploration
at other cities, such as Jezreel, Samaria,
Hebron, Bethshan, Nazareth, and excavation
of the mounds scattered over the
face of the country. There will probably
never be a better opportunity than the present:
for the visit of the Prince of Wales to
the Holy Land removed some prejudices,
the Turkish Government is favourable to the
enterprise, and the work is actually begun.
We conclude this review of the work of the
Palestine Exploration Fund by heartily endorsing
the appeal of Mr. Deutsch at the
annual meeting in 1869. 'We, as humble
votaries of science, would, in the name of
science, urge you to continue that in which
both religion and science may join. And
let me remind you of one thing. There are
ruins enough in the City of Sorrows. <i>Do
not add fresh ruins.</i> Do not leave there
broken shafts, abandoned galleries; and let
it not be told in Gath that this England, the
richest, proudest, and most Bible-loving
country in the world, undertook one of the
greatest undertakings, and abandoned it&mdash;for
want of money.'</p>

<p class="p2">The events of the last few months have, in
a special way, drawn the thoughts of men
towards two cities which stand out among
European capitals as witnesses of the way in
which the history of remote times still has
its direct bearing on things which are passing
before our own eyes. Rome and Paris
now stand out, as they have stood out in so
many earlier ages, as the historic centres of
a period which, there can be no doubt, will
live to all time as one of the marked periods
of the world's history. And it is not the
least wonderful ph&aelig;nomenon of this autumn
of wonders that, while our eyes have been
drawn at once to Rome and to Paris, they
have been drawn far more steadily and with
far keener interest towards Paris than they
have been drawn towards Rome. We can
hardly doubt, whether we look back to the
past or onwards to the future, that the fall
of the Pope's temporal power is really a
greater event than any possible result of the
war between Germany and France. Yet
such is the greater immediate interest of the
present struggle, such perhaps is the instinctive
attraction of mankind towards the more
noisy and brilliant triumphs of the siege and
the battle-field, that the really greater event,
simply because of the ease with which it has
happened, has passed almost unnoticed in
the presence of the lesser. The world has
seen the Papacy in several shapes; but the
shape of a Pontiff, spiritually infallible, but
politically a subject, and the subject not of
an universal Emperor but of a mere local
King, is something which the world has not
seen before. What may come of it, no man
can say; but we may be pretty sure that
greater things will come of it in one way or
another, than can come out of any settlement,
in whatever direction, of conflicting
French and German interests. Still, at this
moment, the present fate of Paris unavoidably
draws to itself more of our thoughts
than the future fate of Rome. But it is well
to keep the two cities together before our eyes,
and all the more so because the past history
and the present position of those two cities
have points in common which no other city
in Europe shares with them in their fulness,
which only one other city in Europe can
claim to share with them in any degree.</p>

<p>The history of Rome, as all the world
knows, is the history of a city which grew
into an Empire. It grew in truth into a
twofold, perhaps a more than twofold Empire.
Out of the village on the Palatine
sprang the Rome of the C&aelig;sars and the
Rome of the Pontiffs. From Rome came
the language, the theology, the code of law,
which have had such an undying effect on
the whole European world. Amidst all
changes, the city itself has been always
clothed with a kind of mysterious and superstitious
charm, and its possession has carried
with it an influence which common military
and political considerations cannot always
explain. And from the Old Rome on
the Tiber many of these attributes passed&mdash;some
were even heightened in passing&mdash;to
the new Rome on the Bosporos. From
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
the days of Constantine till now, no man
has ever doubted that, in the very nature of
things, Constantinople, in whatever hands,
must be the seat of empire. To Western
eyes this seems mainly the result of her unrivalled
geographical situation; over large
regions of the East the New Rome wields
the same magic influence which in the West
has been wielded by the Old. <i>The</i> City,<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
the City of the C&aelig;sars, is in Christian eyes
the one great object to be won; in Mahometan
eyes it is the one great object to be
kept. By the Bosporos, as by the Tiber,
it is the city which has grown into the Empire,
which has founded it, and which has
sustained it.</p>

<p>Now of the other capitals of Europe&mdash;the
capitals of the more modern states&mdash;one
alone can claim to have been, in this way,
the creator of the state of which it is now
the head. Berlin, Madrid, Stockholm, Copenhagen,
Saint Petersburg, are simply places
chosen in later times, for reasons of caprice or
convenience, as administrative centres of states
which already existed. Vienna has grown
from the capital of a Duchy into the capital
of something which calls itself an Empire;
but Vienna, as a city, has had nothing to do
with the growth of that so-called Empire.
London may fairly claim a higher place than
any of the cities of which we have spoken.
It was only by degrees, and after some fluctuations,
that London, rather than Winchester,
came to be permanently acknowledged
as the capital of England. London won its
rank, partly by virtue of an unrivalled military
and commercial position, partly as the
reward of the unflinching patriotism of its
citizens in the Danish wars. But London in
no way formed England, or guided her destinies.
The history of London is simply
that the city was found to be the most fitting
and worthy head of an already existing
kingdom. But Paris has been what London
has been, and something more. Paris, like
London, earned her pre-eminence in Gaul by
a gallant and successful resistance to the
Scandinavian enemy. It was the great siege
of Paris in the ninth century which made
Paris the chief among the cities of Gaul, and
its Count the chief among the princes of
Gaul. Its position first marked it out for
the rank of a local capital, and, through the
way in which it used its position, it grew
into the capital of a kingdom. But it did
not, like London, simply grow into the capital
of a kingdom already existing. The city
created first the county, and then the kingdom,
of which it was successively the head.
Modern France, as distinguished both from
Roman Gaul and from the Western Kingdom
of the Karlings, grew out of this County
of Paris; and of the County of Paris the
city was not merely the centre, but the life
and soul. The position of Paris in the earliest
times is best marked, as in the case of
all Gaulish cities, by its place in the ecclesiastical
hierarchy. It was a city, not of the
first, but of the second rank; the seat of a
Bishop, but not the seat of a Metropolitan.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
Lutetia Parisiorum held the usual rank of
one of those head towns of Gaulish tribes
which grew into Roman cities. But it never
became the centre of one of the great ecclesiastical
and civil divisions; it never reached
the rank of Lyons, Narbonne, Vienne, or
Trier. Twice before the ninth century, the
discerning eye, first of a Roman and then of
a Frankish master, seemed to mark out the
city of the Seine for greater things. It was
the beloved home of Julian; it was the city
which Hlodwig at once fixed upon for the
seat of his new dominion. But the greatness
of Paris, as the earliest settled seat of
the Frankish power, was not doomed to be
lasting. Under the descendants of Hlodwig
Paris remained a seat of royalty; but, among
the fluctuations of the Merovingian kingdoms,
it was only one seat of royalty among
several. It was the peer of Soissons, Orleans,
and Metz&mdash;all of them places which thus, in
the new state of things, assumed a higher importance
than had belonged to them in Roman
times. But, as the Austrasian House of
the Karlings grew, first as Mayors, and then
as Kings, to the lordship of the whole
Frankish realm, the importance of the cities
of Western Gaul necessarily lessened. Paris
reached its utmost point of insignificance in
the days of Charles the Great, whom French
legends have pictured as a French King,
reigning in Paris as his royal city. Whatever
importance it had, it seems to have derived
from its neighbourhood to the revered
sanctuary of St. Denis. By a strange accident,
the first King of the new house&mdash;the
house with which Paris was to wage a war
of races and languages&mdash;died either in the
city itself, or in the precinct of the great
monastery beyond its walls. Pippin, returning
from a successful campaign in Aquitaine,
fell sick at Saintes; from thence he was carried
to Tours to implore the help of Saint
Martin, and thence to Paris to implore the
help of Saint Denis. He died at Paris, and
was buried in the great minster which became
the burial-place of the next and rival line of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
kings.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> But Paris was neither the crowning-place
nor the dwelling-place of his son, nor was
it the object of any special attention during his
long reign. Of the two sons of Pippin, between
whom his kingdom was immediately divided,
Paris fell to the lot of Karlmann. But he
chose Soissons for his crowning-place&mdash;the
place where his father had been crowned before
him.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Charles, crowned at Noyon,
made Aachen his capital, and, in the course
of his whole reign, he visited Paris only on
a single progress, when it is incidentally
mentioned among a long string of other
cities.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>But this time of utter neglect was, in
the history of Paris, only the darkness before
the coming of the dawn. In the course
of the next reign Paris begins to play an important
part, and from that time the importance
of the city steadily grew till it became
what we have seen it in our own day.
The occasional visits of Lewis the Pious to
the city are dwelled on by his poetical biographer
with evident delight, and with even
more than usual pomp of words.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>. And the
city was now about to appear in its most
characteristic; light. In the words of Sir
Francis Palgrave, who has sketched the
early history of Paris with great power and
insight,<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> 'the City of Revolutions begins her
real history by the first French Revolution.'<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
In this particular case we do not even grudge
the premature use of the word 'French,' for
the movement of which he speaks was
plainly a movement of the Romanized lands
of the West against their Teutonic master.
Most likely no such feeling was consciously
present to the mind of any man; but nations
and parties seek to shape themselves
unconsciously, and cities and regions learn
to play their appropriate parts, before they
can give any intelligible account of what
they are doing. The Emperor was leading
an expedition against the revolted Bretons;
suddenly all the disaffected spirits of the
Empire, his own sons among the foremost,
gathered themselves together at Paris.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
They then seized Lewis himself at Compi&egrave;gne,
and their hated step-mother Judith
on the rock of Laon. But one part of his
dominions was still faithful to the imprisoned
C&aelig;sar; the German lands had no share
in the rebellion, and eagerly sought for the
restoration of their sovereign. In marking
out the geographical divisions of feeling, the
writer of the ninth century, like those of the
nineteenth, is driven, as it were, to forestal
the language of a somewhat later time. The
Emperor had no confidence in the French,
but he put his trust in the German.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the part&mdash;a characteristic part&mdash;played
by Paris in the Revolution of 830.
Four years later Paris appears playing an opposite,
yet a no less characteristic part. The
Emperor Lewis, already restored and again
deposed, is held as a prisoner by his eldest
son Lothar, and is led in bonds to Paris.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
Again the men of the East, the faithful Germans,
are in arms for their sovereign under
Lewis, at that moment his only loyal son.
But by this time the city has changed sides.
Lothar, for fear of the German host, flees to
the South, leaving his father at liberty; the
late captive is led by his rejoicing people to
the minster of Saint Denis, and there is girt
once more with the arms of the warrior and
with the Imperial robes of the C&aelig;sar.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Once
then in the course of its long history, did
Paris behold the inauguration of a lawful
Emperor. But it was the re-inauguration of
an Emperor whom one Parisian revolution
had overthrown, and whom another Parisian
revolution had set up again; and in the moment
alike of his fall and of his restoration
the force of loyal Germany forms at one
time a threatening, at another an approving,
background.</p>

<p>We thus see Paris, well-nigh unheard of
during the reign of Charles the Great, suddenly
rise into importance under his son.
Under Charles the Bald its importance becomes
greater still, and it begins to assume
the peculiar function which raised it to the
head place in Gaul. The special wretchedness
of the time was fast showing the great
military importance of the site. Under the
rule of the Austrasian Mayors and Kings
there had been endless wars, but they had
been wars waged far away from Paris.
Above all, no hostile fleet had for ages sailed
up the Seine. Lutetia on her island must,
under the Frankish power, have enjoyed for
some generations a repose almost as unbroken
as she had enjoyed in the days of the
<i>Roman Peace</i>. Now all was changed. The
Empire was torn in pieces by endless civil
wars, wars of brother against brother, and
the fleets of the Northmen, barely heard of
in the days of Charles the Great, were making
their way up the months of all its rivers.
Men now began to learn that the island city,
encompassed by the broad Seine, with its
bridges and its minsters, and the Roman palace
on the left bank, was at once among the
most precious possessions and among the
surest bulwarks of the realm. It is not without
significance that the one time when the
Great Charles himself visited Paris, it was in
the course of a progress in which he had
been surveying the shores of the Northern
Ocean.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> He came to Paris as a mourner
and as a pilgrim, yet we may believe that
neither his grief nor his devotion hindered
him from marking the importance of the post.
His eye surely marked the site as one fated
to be the main defence, if not of his whole
Empire, at least of its western portion, against
the pirate-barks by which the Ocean was beginning
to be covered. And probably it was
not mere accident that it was in the course
of an expedition against Brittany that Paris
became the centre of the conspiracy of 830.
In a Breton war, a land war, Paris would
not be of the same pre-eminent importance
as it was in the invasion of the Northmen.
Still the island stronghold would be of no
small moment in case of a Breton inroad,
and in the days of Lewis the Pious a Breton
inroad was again a thing to be dreaded.
Among the troubles of the next reign the
pre-eminent importance of Paris begins to
stand out more and more strongly. By the
last partition under Lewis the Pious, his
youngest son, Charles the Bald, became King
of a kingdom formed by the accidental
union of Neustria and Aquitaine. The kingdom
so formed answered to nothing which
had been thought of in earlier divisions, but
it answered in a kind of rough way to modern
France. Far smaller as a whole, it took in
districts at both ends, in Flanders and in
Catalonia, which have long ceased to be
looked upon as French. But it nowhere
came near to the coveted frontier of the
Rhine and the Alps. Of this kingdom it
seemed at first that Paris was at once to become
the capital; no other city filled so
prominent a place in the early history of the
reign of Charles the Bald. In the very beginning
of his reign we find Charles making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
use of the position of the city and its bridge:
to bar the progress of his brother, the Emperor
Lothar. We find him dwelling for a
long time in the city, and giving the citizens
the delight of a spectacle by appearing
among them in royal pomp at the Easter festival.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
Four years later, the city began to
appear in its other character as the great
mark for Scandinavian attack. The northern
pirates were now swarming on every sea,
and the coasts of Britain, Gaul, and Germany
were all alike desolated by their harryings.
But they instinctively felt that, while
no shore lay more temptingly for their objects
than the shores of Northern Gaul, there
was no point either of the insular or of the
continental realm where their approach was
better guarded against. The island city,
with its two bridges and its strongly fortified
Roman suburb on the mainland, blocked their
path as perhaps no other stronghold in Gaul
or Britain could block it.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> In the very year
of the fight of Fontenay, as if they had
scented the mutual slaughter from afar, the
Northmen had sailed up the stream and had
harried Rouen and the surrounding lands
with the sternest horrors of fire and sword.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
Four years later they pressed on yet further
into the heart of the defenceless realm;
Paris was attacked; in strange contrast with
the valour of its citizens forty years later, no
one had the heart to resist; the city was
stormed and sacked; and King Charles, finding
his forces unequal to defend or to avenge,
was driven to forestal the wretched policy of
&AElig;thelred, and to buy a momentary respite
from the invaders.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Other attacks, other
harryings followed. One more terrible than
all, in the year 857, was specially remembered
on account of the frightful havoc wrought
among the churches of the city. The church
of Saint Genoveva, on the left bank of the
river&mdash;better known to modern ears as the
Pantheon&mdash;was burned, Saint Stephen's, afterwards
known as N&ocirc;tre Dame, Saint Germans,
and Saint Denis, bought their deliverance
only by large ransoms.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> In the minds
of the preachers of the time the woes of
Paris suggested the woes of Jerusalem and
a wail of sorrow went up from the Jeremiah
of the age for the havoc of the city and its
holy places.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>When we remember the importance to
which Paris was plainly beginning to rise
under Lewis the Pious, we may perhaps be
led to think that it was the constant attacks
to which the city was exposed which hindered
it from becoming the permanent dwelling-place
of royalty under Charles the Bald.
That the city held a place in his affections
throughout his life is shown by his choosing
Saint Denis as the place of his burial. But
it never became the royal city of the Kings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
of his house. We need hardly look on it as
a mark of personal cowardice in Charles that
he preferred to fix the ordinary seat of his
government in some other place than the
most exposed fortress of his kingdom. Compi&egrave;gne
now often appears as a royal dwelling-place;
but the home and centre of Carolingian
royalty in the Western Kingdom
gradually fixed itself on a spot the most opposite
to Paris in position and feeling which
the Western Kingdom could afford. Paris
and Laon were in every sense rivals; their
rivalry is stamped upon their very outward
appearance. Each is a representative city.
Paris, like Ch&acirc;lons and Bristol, is essentially
an island city; the river was its defence
against ordinary enemies, however easily that
defence might be changed into a highway for
its attack in the hands of the amphibious
Northmen. But Laon is the very pride of
that class of towns which out of Gaulish hill-forts
grew into Roman and medi&aelig;val cities.
None stands more proudly on its height;
none has kept its ancient character so little
changed to our own day. The town still
keeps itself within the walls which fence in
the hill-top, and whatever there is of suburb
has grown up at the foot, apart from the ancient
city. Paris again was the home of the
new-born nationality of the Romance speech,<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
the home of the new French nation. Laon
stood near the actual German border, in a
land where German was still spoken; it was
fitted in every way to be, as it proved, the
last home of a German dynasty in the West.
There can be little doubt that, by thus moving
eastward, by placing themselves in this
outlying Teutonic corner of their realm, the
Carolingian Kings of the West threw away
the opportunity of putting themselves at the
head of the new national movement, and of
reigning as national Kings, if not of the
whole Romance-speaking population of Gaul,
at least of its strictly French portion north
of the Loire.</p>

<p>Of such a mission we may be sure Charles
the Bald and his successors never dreamed.
The chances are that those to whom that
mission really fell dreamed of it just as little.
We must never forget that the national
movements of those days were for the most
part instinctive and unconscious; but they
were all the more powerful and lasting for
being instinctive and unconscious. An act
of Charles the Bald, one of the ordinary
grants by a King to one of his vassals,
created the French nation. The post from
which the King himself shrank was entrusted
to a valiant subject, and Robert the Strong,
the mightiest champion of the land against
the heathen invader, received the government
of the whole border land threatened
by the Breton and the Northman.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> We
may be sure that the thoughts of the King
himself did not reach at the most beyond
satisfaction at having provided the most important
post in his realm with a worthy
defender. To shield himself from the enemy
by such a barrier as was furnished by Robert's
country, it was worth while to sacrifice
the direct possession even of the fair lands
between the Loire and the Seine. His
dominion was a <i>mark</i>;<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> his truest title a
<i>marquis</i>. But the Mark of France, like the
Mark of Brandenburg and the Mark of
Austria, was destined to great things. Robert
no doubt, like the other governors and
military chiefs, who were fast growing from
magistrates into Princes, rejoiced in the prospect
of becoming the source of a dynasty, a
dynasty which could not fail to take a high
place among the princes of Gaul. But he
hardly dreamed of founding a line of Kings,
and a line of Kings the most lasting that the
world ever saw. Still less did he dream of
founding a nation. But he did both. The
Counts who held the first place of danger
and honour soon eclipsed in men's eyes the
Kings who had retired to the safer obscurity
of their eastern frontier. The city of the
river became a national centre in a way in
which the city of the rock could never be.
The people of the struggling Romance
speech of northern Gaul found a centre
and a head in the rising city and its
gallant princes. That Robert was himself of
German descent, the son of a stranger from
some of the Teutonic provinces of the Empire,<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
mattered not a whit. From the beginning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
of their historic life the Parisian
Dukes and Kings have been the leaders and
representatives of the new French nationality.
No royal dynasty has ever been so thoroughly
identified with the nation over which it ruled,
because no royal dynasty could be so truly
said to have created the nation. Paris,
France, and the Dukes and Kings of the
French are three ideas which can never be
kept asunder. A true instinct soon gave the
ruler of the new state a higher and a more
significant title. The Count of Paris was
merged in the Duke of the French, and the
Duke of the French was soon to be merged
in the King. The name of <i>Francia</i>, a name
whose shiftings and whose changes of meaning
have perplexed both history and politics&mdash;a
name which Eastern and Western writers
seem to have made it a kind of point of
honour to use in different meanings<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>&mdash;now
gradually settles down, as far as the Western
Kingdom is concerned, into the name of a
territory, answering roughly to the Celtic
Gaul of the elder geography.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> It has still
to be distinguished by epithets like <i>Occidentalis</i>
and <i>Latina</i>, from the Eastern <i>Francia</i>
of Teutonic speech, but, in the language of
Gaul, <i>Francia</i> and <i>Franci</i> for the future
mean the dominion and the subjects of the
lord of Paris. We need not say that the
lands beyond the Rhone, the Sa&ocirc;ne, and the
Maes, which formed no part of the Western
Kingdom, are not included under the name
of <i>Francia</i>. But neither are the lands held,
like the French Duchy, in fief of the common
sovereign, Brittany, Flanders, Aquitaine, and
the ducal Burgundy. To these must be
added Normandy, the land wrested from the
French Duchy to form the inheritance of the
converted Northman. France is still but one
among the principalities of Gaul; but, like
Wessex in England, like Castile in Spain,
like Prussia in Germany and Piedmont in
Italy, it was the one destined, by one means
or another, to swallow up the rest. From
the grant of 861, from the foundation of the
Parisian Duchy, we may date the birth of
the French state and nation. From that day
onwards France is whatever can, by fair
means or foul, be brought into obedience to
Paris and her ruler.</p>

<p>Count Robert the Strong, the Maccab&aelig;us
of the West-Frankish realm, the patriarch of
the old Capets, of the Valois, and of the
Bourbons, died as he had lived, fighting for
Gaul and Christendom against the heathen
Dane.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> But his dominion and his mission
passed to a son worthy of him&mdash;to Odo, or
Eudes,<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> the second Count of his house, presently
to be the first of the Kings of Paris.
In his day came the great struggle, the
mighty and fiery trial, which was to make
the name of Paris and her lord famous
throughout the world. On the great siege
of Paris by the Northmen, the turning-point
in the history of the city, of the Duchy,
and in truth of all Western Europe, we may
fairly dwell at somewhat greater detail than
we have done on the smaller events which
paved the way for it. We must bear in
mind the wretched state of all the countries
which made up the Carolingian Empire.
The Northmen were sailing up every
river, and were spreading their ravages to
every accessible point. Every year in the
various contemporary annals is marked by
the harrying of some fresh district, by the
sack of some city, by the desecration of
some revered monastery.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Resistance, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
there was any, was almost wholly local; the
invaders were so far from encountering the
whole force of the Empire that they never
encountered the whole force of any one of
its component kingdoms. The day of Saul-court,
renowned in that effort of old Teutonic
minstrelsy which may rank alongside of
our own songs of Brunanburh and Maldon,<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
the day when the young king Lewis led the
West-Frankish host to victory over the heathen,<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
stands out well-nigh alone in the records
of that unhappy time. While neither
realm was spared, while one set of invaders
ravaged the banks of the Seine and the
Loire, while another more daring band sacked
Aachen, K&ouml;ln, and Trier,<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> the rival Kings
of the Franks were mainly intent on extending
their borders at the expense of one
another. Charles the Bald was far more
eager to extend his nominal frontier to the
Rhine,<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> or to come back from Italy adorned
with the Imperial titles,<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> than he was to
take any active step to drive out the common
enemy of all the kindred realms. At
last the whole Empire, save the Burgundian
Kingdom of Boso, was once more joined
together under Charles the Fat. Paris was
again under the nominal sovereignty of an
Emperor whose authority, equally nominal
everywhere, extended also over Rome and
Aachen. Precarious and tottering as such
an Empire was, the even nominal union of
so many crowns on a single head, however
unfit that head was to bear their weight,
does seem to have given for the moment
something like a feeling of greater unity
and thereby of greater strength. Paris, defended
by its own Count and its own Bishop,
was defended by them in the name of His
Emperor, Lord of the World.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> The sovereigns
alike of East and West were appealed
to for help, and at least a show of help was
sent in the name of both parts of the Frankish
realm.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> The defence of Paris was
essentially a local defence, waged by its own
citizens under the command of their local
chiefs. Still the great check which the
invaders then received came nearer to a national
act on the part of the whole Frankish
Empire than anything which had happened
since the death of Charles the Great.</p>

<p>Our materials for the great siege are
fairly abundant. Several of the contemporary
chronicles, in describing this gallant
struggle, throw off somewhat of their usual
meagreness, and give an account conceived
with an unusual degree of spirit and carried
out with an unusual amount of detail.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> And
we have a yet more minute account, which,
even as it is, is of considerable value, and
which, had it been a few degrees less wearisome
and unintelligible, would have been of
the highest interest. Abbo, a distinguished
churchman of those times, a monk of the
house of Saint German, and not only a contemporary,
but a spectator and sharer in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
defence,<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> conceived the happy idea of writing
a minute narrative of the exciting scenes
which he had witnessed. But he unhappily
threw his tale into the shape of hexameters
which have few rivals for affectation and
obscurity. The political biographer of Lewis
the Pious at all events writes Latin; Abbo
writes in a Babylonish dialect of his own
composing, stuffed full of Greek and other
out-of-the-way words, and to parts of which
he himself found it needful to attach a glossary.
Still with all this needless darkness,
he gives us many details, and he especially
preserves many individual names which we
should not find out from the annalists. A
fervent votary of Saint German, a loyal citizen
of Paris, a no less loyal subject of the
valiant Count who, when he wrote, had
grown into a King, Abbo had every advantage
which personal knowledge and local interest
could give to a narrator of the struggle.
Only we cannot help wishing that he had
stooped to tell his tale, if not in his native
tongue, whether Romance or Teutonic, yet
at least in the intelligible Latin of Nithard
in a past generation and of Richer in a future
one.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>The poet begins with a panegyric on his
city, in which he may, while dealing with
such a theme, be forgiven for somewhat
unduly exalting its rank among the cities of
the world.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Its position, the strength of the
island-fortress, connected with the mainland
by its castles on either side, is plainly set
forth.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> The defenders of the city are clearly
set before us; Odo the Count, the future
King, as we are often reminded,<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> and
Gozlin the Bishop, stand forth in the front
rank. Around the two great local chiefs are
gathered a secondary band of their kinsfolk
and supporters, clerical and lay. There is
Odo's brother Robert, himself to wear a
crown in the city which he defended, but in
days to which the foresight of the poet did
not extend. There is the valiant Count
Ragnar; there is the warlike Abbot Ebles
of Saint Germans, whose exploits are recorded
with special delight by the loyal monk of
his house.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> A crowd of lesser names are also
handed down to us, names of men who had
their honourable share in the work, but with
whose bare names it is hardly needful to
burthen the memories of modern readers.
A great object of attack on the part of the
Northmen was the castle which guarded the
bridge on the right bank of the river,
represented in after times by the Grand
Ch&acirc;telet. The watchful care of the Bishop
had been diligent in strengthening this and
the other defences of the city; but the last
works which were to guard this important
point were not fully finished.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> The Danish
fleet now drew near, a fleet manned, so it
was said, by more than thirty thousand
warriors.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> As in the tale of our own Brihtnoth,<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
the invaders began with a peaceful
message. The leader of the pirates, Sigefrith,
the sea-king,&mdash;a king, as the poet tells us,
without a kingdom<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>&mdash;sought an interview
with Count Odo, and demanded a peaceful
passage through the city. Odo sternly
answers that the city is entrusted to his care
by his lord the Emperor, and that he will
never forsake the duty which was laid upon
him. The siege now began; the Northmen
strove to storm the unfinished tower. After
two days of incessant fighting, and an intervening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
night spent in repairing the defences,
the valour of the defenders prevailed. The
Count and the Bishop, and the Abbot who
could pierce seven Danes with a single shot
of his arrow,<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> finally drove back the heathen
to their ships; and instead of the easy storm
and sack which they doubtless looked for
on this, as on earlier occasions, the Northmen
were driven to undertake the siege of the
city in form.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>One is a little surprised at the progress in
the higher branches of the art of war which
had clearly been made by the enemy who
now assaulted Paris. The description of
their means of attack, if not intelligible in
every detail, at least shows that the freebooters,
merciless heathens as they were,
were at all events thorough masters of the
engineering science of their age.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> But,
through the whole winter of 885, all their
attempts were unavailing. The skill and
valour of the defenders were equal to those
of the besiegers, and their hearts were strung
by every motive which could lead men to
defend themselves to the last. But early in
the next year, in February 886, accident
threw a great advantage into the hands of
the besiegers. A great flood in the Seine
swept away, or greatly damaged, the lesser
bridge, the painted bridge, that which joined
the island to the fortress on the left bank of
the river.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> That fortress and the suburb
which it defended, the suburb which contained
the Roman palace and the ministers
of Saint Genoveva and Saint German, were
thus cut off from the general defences of the
city. The watchful care of the Bishop
strove to repair the bridge by night. But
the attempt was forestalled by the invaders;
the tower was isolated and surrounded by
the enemy. The Bishop and the other
defenders of the city were left to behold, to
weep, and to pray from the walls, at the fate
of their brethren whom they could no longer
help.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> The tower was fiercely attacked;
the gate did not give way till fire was
brought to help the blows of the Northmen;
the defenders of the tower all perished either
by the flames or by the sword, and their
bodies were hurled into the river before the
eyes of their comrades.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> The conquerors
now destroyed the tower, and from their
new vantage ground they pressed the
siege of the island city with increased
vigour.</p>

<p>The chances of war seemed now to be
turning against the besieged. The stout
heart of Bishop Gozlin at last began to fail;
he saw that Paris could no longer be defended
by the arms of its citizens only. He sent
a message to Henry, the Duke of the Eastern
Franks, praying him to come to the defence
of the Christian people. The Duke came;
we are told that his presence did little or
nothing for the besieged city;<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> yet in the
obscure verses of the poet we seem to
discern something like a night attack on the
Danish camp on the part of the Saxon Duke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
and his followers.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> But in any case the
coming of the German allies did nothing
for the permanent relief of the city. They
went back to their own land; Paris was
again left to its own resources, and at last
the Bishop, worn out with sorrow and
illness, began to seek the usual delusive
remedy. He began to enter into negotiations
with Sigefrith, which were cut short by the
prelate's death. The news was known in the
Danish camp before it was commonly known
within the walls of Paris, and the mass of
the citizens first learnt from the insulting
shouts of the besiegers that their valiant
Bishop was no more.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>The Bishop, as long as he lived, had been
the centre and soul of the whole defence,
yet it would seem that, at the actual moment
of his death, his removal was a gain. We
hear no more, at least on the part of the
men of Paris, of any attempts at treating
with the enemy. One bitter wail of despair
from the besieged city reaches our ears, and
the hero of the second act of the siege now
stands forth. The spiritual chief was gone;
the temporal chief steps into his place, and
more than into his place. Count Odo appears
as cheering the hearts of the people
by his eloquence, and as leading them on to
repeated combats with the besiegers.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> At
last hunger began to tell on the strength of
the defenders; help from without was plainly
needed, and this time it was to be sought,
not from any inferior chief, but from the
common sovereign, the Emperor and King
of so many realms. Count Odo himself
went forth on the perilous errand; he called
on the princes of the Empire for help in the
time of need, and warned the sluggish Augustus
himself that, unless help came speedily,
the city would be lost for ever.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Long before
any troops were set in motion in any
quarter for the deliverance of Paris, the
valiant Count was again within its walls,
bringing again a gleam of joy to the sad
hearts of the citizens, both by the mere fact
of his presence and by the gallant exploit by
which he was enabled to appear among
them. The Northmen knew of his approach,
and made ready to bar his way to the city.
Before the gate of the tower on the right
bank, the tower which still guarded the
northern bridge, the lines of the heathen
stood ready to receive the returning champion.
Odo's horse was killed under him, but,
sword in hand, he hewed himself a path
through the thick ranks of the enemy; he
made good his way to the gate, and was
once more within the walls of his own city,
ready to share every danger of his faithful
people.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>Such a city, we may well say, deserved to
become the seat of Kings, and such a leader
deserved to wear a royal crown within its
walls. Eight months of constant fighting
passed away after the return of Odo before
the lord alike of Rome, of Aachen, and of
Paris appeared before the city where just
now his presence was most needed. Towards
the last days of summer Duke Henry
again appeared, but it was fully autumn before
the Emperor himself found his way to
the banks of the Seine.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Duke Henry
came, with an army drawn from both the
Frankish realms, Eastern and Western.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
With more show of prudence than he had
shown at his former coming, Henry began
by reconnoitring both the city and the
camp of the enemy, to judge at what point
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
an attack might be made with least risk.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
But the Northmen were too wary for him.
They had surrounded their whole camp with
a network of trenches, three feet deep and
one foot wide, filled up with straw and
brushwood, and made to present the appearance
of a level surface.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> A small party only
were left in ambush. As the Duke drew
near, they sprang up, hurled their javelins,
and provoked him with shouts. Henry
pressed on in wrath, but he was soon caught
in the simple trap which had been laid for
him; his horse fell, and he himself was
hurled to the ground. The enemy rushed
upon him, slew him, and stripped him in
the sight of his army.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> One of the defenders
of the city, the brave Count Ragnar, of
whom we have already heard, came in time
only to bear off the body, at the expense of
severe wounds received in his own person.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
The corpse of the Duke was carried to
Soissons and was buried in the Church of
Saint M&eacute;dard. The army of Henry, disheartened
by the loss of their chief, presently
returned to their own homes. Paris was
again left to its own resources, cheered only
by such small rays of hope as might spring
from the drowning of one of the besieging
leaders in the river.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>The news of the death of Henry was
brought to the Emperor. Notwithstanding
his grief&mdash;perhaps an euphemism for his
fear&mdash;he pressed on towards Paris with his
army; but even the chronicler most favourable
to him is obliged to confess that the
lord of so many nations, at the head of the
host gathered from all his realms, did nothing
worthy of the Imperial majesty.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> All
in truth that the Emperor Charles did was
to patch up a treaty with the barbarians, by
virtue of which, on condition of their raising
the siege of Paris, they received a large sum
as the ransom of the city, and were allowed
to ravage Burgundy without let or hindrance.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
We are told indeed that this step
was taken because the land to be ravaged&mdash;are
we to understand the Kingdom of Boso?&mdash;was
in rebellion.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> At all events, the
Christian Emperor, the last who reigned
over the whole Empire, handed over a Christian
land as a prey to pagan teeth, and left
Paris without striking a blow. Charles went
straight back into Germany, and there spent
the small remnant of his reign and life in a
disgraceful domestic quarrel.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> One act
however he did which concerns our story.
Hugh the Abbot, the successor of Robert
the Strong in the greater part of his Duchy,
had died during the siege. The valiant
Count of Paris was now, by Imperial grant,
put in possession of all the domains which
had been held by his father.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span></p>

<p>But the Count was not long to remain a
mere Count; the city and its chief were
alike to receive the reward of their services
in the cause of Christendom. Presently
came that strange and unexampled event by
which the last Emperor of the legitimate
male stock of the Great Charles was deposed
by the common consent of all his dominions.
The Empire again split up into separate
Kingdoms, ruled over by Kings of their
own choice. The choice of the Western
realm fell, as it well deserved to fall, upon
the illustrious Count of Paris. The reign of
Odo indeed was not undisturbed, nor was
his title undisputed. He had to struggle in
the beginning of his reign with a rival in
the Italian Guy, and in latter years he had
to withstand the more formidable opposition
of a rival King of the old Imperial line.
And chosen as he was by the voice of what
we may now almost venture to call the
French people, hallowed as King in the old
royal seat of Compi&egrave;gne by the hands of
the Primate of Sens, the Metropolitan of his
own Paris,<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Odo had still to acknowledge
the greater power and higher dignity of the
Eastern King. He had to confess himself
the man of Arnulf, to receive his crown
again at Arnulf's hands, while Arnulf was
not as yet a Roman Emperor, but still only
a simple King of the East Franks.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Still
the Count had become a King; the city
which his stout heart and arm had so well
defended had become a royal city. The
rank indeed both of the city and its King,
was far from being firmly fixed. A hundred
years of shiftings and changings of dynasties,
of rivalry between Laon and Paris, between
the Frank and the Frenchman, had
still to follow. But the great step had been
taken; there was at last a King of the French
reigning in Paris. The city which by its
own great deeds had become the cradle of a
nation, the centre of a kingdom, was now
placed in the foremost rank at their head.
The longest and most unbroken of the royal
dynasties of Europe had now begun to reign.
And it had begun to reign, because the first
man of that house who wore a crown was
called to that crown as the worthiest man in
the realm over which he ruled.</p>

<p>But we must go back to the enemy before
Paris. By the treaty concluded with
the Emperor, they were to raise the siege,
but they were left at liberty to harry Burgundy
and other lands. The citizens of
Paris, however, steadfastly refused to allow
them to pass up the Seine; so the Northmen
ventured on a feat which in that age
was looked on as unparalleled.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> They saw,
we are told, that the city could not be
taken; so they carried their ships for two
miles by land, and set sail at a point of the
river above the city.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> While the Empire
was falling in pieces, while new kingdoms
were arising and were being struggled for
by rival kings, the Northmen were harrying
at pleasure. Soissons was sacked;<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> after a
long and vain attack on the mighty walls of
Sens, the enemy found it convenient to retire
on a payment of money.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Meaux also,
under the valiant Count Theodberht, stood
a siege; but after the death of their defender,
the citizens capitulated. The capitulation
was broken by the Northmen; the city
was burned, and the inhabitants were massacred.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
By this time Odo was King. Meanwhile
the Northmen, after their retreat from
Sens, had made another attempt on Paris,
and had been again beaten off by the valiant
citizens.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> The King now came to what was
now his royal city, and established a fortified
camp in the neighbourhood to secure it
from future attacks.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Yet when the Northmen
once more besieged Paris in the autumn
of 889, even Odo himself had to
stoop to the common means of deliverance,
The new King, the first Parisian King,
bought off the threatened attack by the payment
of a Danegeld, and the pirates went
away by land and sea to ravage the Constantine
peninsula, the land which, a generation
or two later, was to become the special
land of the converted Northmen.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span></p>

<p>Paris was finally secured against Scandinavian
attack by the establishment of the
Duchy of Normandy. By the treaty of Clair-on-Epte
in 913, Rolf Ganger, changed in
French and Latin mouths into Rou and Rollo,
became the man of the King of Laon for
lands which were taken away from the dominion
of the Duke of Paris. Charles the
Simple, the restored Karling, was now
King; Robert, the brother of Odo, was
Duke of the French, and there can be no
doubt that the tottering monarchy of Laon
gained much by the dismemberment of the
Parisian Duchy and by the establishment at
the mouth of the Seine of a vassal bound
by special ties to the King himself. The
foundation of the Rouen Duchy at once secured
Paris against all assaults of mere
heathen pirates. France had now a neighbour
to the immediate north of her&mdash;a
neighbour who shut her off from the sea and
from the mouth of her own great river&mdash;a
neighbour with whom she might have her
wars, as with other neighbours&mdash;but a neighbour
who had embraced her creed, who was
speedily adopting her language and manners,
and who formed, part of the same general
political system as herself. The shifting relations
between France and Normandy during
the tenth and eleventh centuries form no
part of our subject, but it will be well to
bear in mind that Paris was at once sheltered
and imprisoned through the Norman possession
of the lower course of the Seine.</p>

<p>It follows then that the next besiegers of
Paris came from a different quarter; and
these next besiegers came from the quarter
from which its last besiegers have come. In
the course of the tenth century, the century
of so many shifting relations between Rouen,
Laon, and Paris, while the rivalry between
King and Duke sometimes broke forth
and sometimes slumbered, Paris was twice
attacked or threatened by German armies.
Both the First and the Second Otto at least
appeared in the near neighbourhood of the
city. In 946, the first and greatest of the
name, not yet Emperor in formal rank, but
already exercising an Imperial pre-eminence
over the kingdoms into which the Frankish
Empire had split up, entered the French
Duchy with two royal allies or vassals in his
train. One was the Burgundian King Conrad,
Lord of the realm between the Rhone
and the Alps; the other was the nominal
King of Paris and its Duke, Lewis, alike the
heir of all the Karlings and the descendant
of our own &AElig;lfred, whose nominal reign
over the Western Kingdom was practically
well nigh confined to the single fortress of
Compi&egrave;gne. Among the shifting relations
of the Princes of the Western Kingdom,
Hugh the Duke of the French and Richard
the Duke of the Normans were now allied
against their Carolingian over-lord. He had
lately been their prisoner, and had been restored
to freedom and kingship only by the
surrender of the cherished possession of his
race, the hill and tower of Laon. Otto, the
mighty Lord of the Eastern realm, felt himself
called on to step in when Teutonic interests
in the Western lands seemed to be
at their last gasp. The three Kings united
their forces against the two Dukes, and
marched against the capitals both of France
and Normandy. But never were the details of
a campaign told in a more contradictory
way. There can be little doubt that Rouen
was besieged, and besieged unsuccessfully.
Thus much at least the German historian
allows;<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> in Norman lands the tale swells into
a magnificent legend.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> What happened at
Paris is still less clear. Laon, for the moment
a French possession, was besieged unsuccessfully,
and Rheims successfully.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> Then,
after a vain attempt on Senlis, the combined
armies of the Kings of Aachen, Arles, and
Compi&egrave;gne drew near to the banks of the
Seine. Flodoard, the canon of Rheims, the
discreetest writer of his age, leaves out all
mention of Paris and its Duke; he tells us
merely that the Kings crossed the river and
harried the whole land except the cities.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
The Saxon Widukind tells us how his King,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
at the head of thirty-two legions, every man
of whom wore a straw hat<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> besieged Duke
Hugh in Paris, and duly performed his devotions
at the shrine of Saint Denis.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
From these two entries we are safe in inferring
that, if Paris was now in any strict
sense besieged, it was at least not besieged
successfully. But Richer, the monk of
Saint Remigius, one of the liveliest tale-tellers
of any age, is ready with one of those
minute stories which, far more than the entries
of more solemn annalists, help to bring
us face to face with the men of distant
times. The Kings were drawing near to the
Seine. In order that the enemy might be
cut off from all means of crossing, the Duke
of the French, Hugh the Great, aware of
their approach, had bidden all vessels, great
and small, to be taken away from the right
bank of the river for the space of twenty
miles. But his design was hindered by a
cunning stratagem of the invaders. Ten
young men, who had made up their mind to
brave every risk,<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> went in advance of the
army of the Kings, having laid aside their
military garb and provided themselves with
the staves and wallets of pilgrims. Protected
by this spiritual armour, they passed unhurt
and unchallenged through the whole
city of Paris, and crossed over both bridges
to the left bank of the river. There, not
far from the suburb of Saint German, dwelt
a miller, who kept the mills which were
turned by the waters of the Seine.<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> He
willingly received the comely youths who
professed to have crossed from the other
side of the river to visit the holy places.
They repaid his hospitality with money, and
moreover purchased wine, in the consumption
of which a jovial day was spent. The
genial drink opened the heart and the lips of
the host, and he freely answered the various
questions of his guests. He was not only
a miller; he was also the Duke's head fisherman,
and he moreover turned an occasional
penny by letting out vessels for hire. The
Germans praised the kindness which he had
already shown them, which made them presume
to ask for further favours. They had
still other holy places to pray at, but they
were wearied with their journey. They
promised him a reward of ten shillings&mdash;no
small sum in the tenth century&mdash;if he
would carry them across to the other side.
He answered that, by the Duke's orders, all
vessels were kept on the left bank to cut off
all means of crossing from the Germans.
They told him that it might be done in the
night without discovery. Eager for his reward,
he agreed. He received the money,
and, accompanied by a boy, his step-son, he
guided them to the spot where seventy-two
ships lay moored to the river side. The boy
was presently thrown into the river, the miller
was seized by the throat, and compelled by
threats of instant death to loose the ships.
He obeyed, and was presently bound and
put on board one of the vessels. Each of
the Germans now entered a ship and steered
it to the right bank. The whole body then
returned in one of the vessels, and each
again brought across another. By going
through this process eight times, the whole
seventy-two ships were brought safely to the
right bank. By daybreak the army of the
Kings had reached the river. They crossed
in safety, for all the inhabitants of the
country had fled, and the Duke himself had
sought shelter at Orleans. The land was
harried as far as the Loire, but of the details
of the siege of Rouen and of the siege
of Paris, if any siege there was, we hear not
a word.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>The military results of the first German
invasion of France and Normandy were certainly
not specially glorious. Laon, Senlis,
Paris, and Rouen, were, to say the least, not
taken. All that was done was to take Rheims
and to ravage a large extent of open country.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
But, in a political point of view, the expedition
was neither unsuccessful nor unimportant.
From that time the influence of
the Eastern King in the affairs of the Western
Kingdom becomes of paramount importance,
and under his protection, the King
of the West Franks, King of Compi&egrave;gne and
soon again to be King of Laon, holds a far
higher place than before in the face of his
mighty vassals at Paris and Rouen. The
next German invasion, forty years later,
found quite another state of things in the
Western Kingdom. The relations between
King Lothar and Duke Hugh Capet were
wholly different from the relations which had
existed between their fathers, King Lewis
and Duke Hugh the Great. No less different
were the relations between Lothar and Otto
the Second from those which had existed
between their fathers, Lewis and Otto the
Great. The elder Otto had been a protector,
first to his brother-in-law and then to his
nephew; the younger Otto was only a rival
in the eyes of his cousin.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> On the other
hand, it was the policy of Hugh Capet to
keep up the dignity of the Crown which he
meant one day to wear, and not to appear as
an open enemy of the dynasty which he
trusted quietly to supplant. For a while
then the rivalry between Laon and Paris was
hushed, and the friendship of Paris carried
with it the friendship of Rouen and Angers.
Thus, while Lewis, a prince than whom none
ever showed a loftier or more gallant spirit,
was hunted from one fortress or one prison
to another, his son, a man in every way his
inferior, was really able to command the
forces of the whole land north of the Loire.
Again the King of Gaul looked Rhine-wards;
the border land of Lotharingia kindled the
ambition of a prince who might deem himself
King both of Laon and Paris. That
border land, after many times fluctuating to
and fro, had now become an acknowledged
portion of the Eastern Kingdom. But a
sudden raid might win it for the King of the
West, and the Duke of Paris would be
nothing loth to help to make such an addition
to the Kingdom which he meant one
day to possess. The raid was made; the
hosts of the King and the Duke crossed the
frontier, and burst suddenly on the Imperial
dwelling-place of Aachen. The Emperor,
with his pregnant wife, the Greek princess
Theophan&ocirc;, had to flee before the approach
of his cousin, and Lothar had the glory of
turning the brazen eagle which his great
forefather had placed on the roof of his
palace in such a direction as no longer to be
a standing menace to the western realms.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
As in a more recent warfare, the Gaul began
with child's play, and the German made
answer in terrible earnest. The dishonour
done to their prince and his realm stirred
the heart of all Germany, and thirty thousand
horsemen&mdash;implying no doubt a far larger
number of warriors of lower degree&mdash;gathered
round their Emperor to defend and
avenge the violated Teutonic soil. Lothar
made no attempt to defend his immediate
dominions; he fled to crave the help of his
mighty vassal at Paris.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> The German hosts
marched, seemingly without meeting any
resistance, from their own frontier to the
banks of the Seine. Everywhere the land
was harried; cities were taken or surrendered,
but the pious Emperor, the Advocate of the
Universal Church, everywhere showed all
due honour to the saints and their holy
places.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> In primatial Rheims, in our own
days to be the temporary home of another
German King, the German C&aelig;sar paid his
devotions at the shrine of Saint Remigius,
the saint who had received an earlier German
conqueror still into the fold of Christ.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
At Soissons Saint M&eacute;dard received equal
worship, and when the church of Saint
Bathild at Chelles was burned without the
Emperor's knowledge, a large sum was
devoted to its restoration. But if the shrines
of the saints were reverenced, the palaces of
the rival King were especially marked out
for destruction. Attigny was burned, and
nearly equal ruin fell upon Compi&egrave;gne itself.
Meanwhile the King had fled to Etampes, in
the immediate territory of the Duke, while
Hugh himself was collecting his forces at
Paris. At last the German host came within
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
sight of the ducal city. Otto now deemed
that he had done enough for vengeance. He
had shown that the frontiers of Germany
were not to be invaded with impunity; he
had come to Paris, not to storm or blockade
the city, but to celebrate his victorious
march with the final triumph of a pious
bravado. He sent a message to the Duke to
say that on the Mount of Martyrs he would
sing such a Hallelujah to the martyrs as the
Duke and people of Paris had never heard.
He performed his vow; a band of clergy
were gathered together on the sacred hill,
and the German host sang their Hallelujah
in the astonished ears of the men of Paris.
This done, the mission of Otto was over, and
after three days spent within sight of Paris,
the Emperor turned him to depart into his
own land.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>Such, at least, is the tale as told by the
admirers of the Imperial devotee. In the
hands of the monk of Rheims the story
assumes quite another shape, and in the
hands of the panegyrist of the house of
Anjou it inevitably grows into a legend.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
Richer tells us how the Emperor stood for
three days on the right bank of the river,
while the Duke was gathering his forces on
the left; how a German Goliath challenged
any man of France to single combat, and
presently fell by the dart of a French, or
perhaps Breton, David;<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> how Otto, seeing
the hosts which were gathering against him,
while his own forces were daily lessening,
deemed that it was his wisest course to retreat.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
As for the details of the retreat, our
stories are still more utterly contradictory.
One loyal French writer makes Lothar, at
the head of the whole force of France and
Burgundy, chase the flying Emperor to the
banks of the Maes, whose waters swallowed
up many of the fugitives.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> The
monk of Rheims transfers the scene of
the German mishap to the nearer banks
of the Aisne,<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> while the Maes is with
him the scene of a friendly conference between
the two Kings, in which Lothar, distrusting
his vassals at Paris, deems it wiser
to purchase the good-will of the Emperor by
the cession of all his claims upon Lotharingia.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
The most striking details come from
the same quarter from which we get the
picture of the Hallelujah on Montmartre.
The Emperor, deeming that he had had
enough of vengeance, departed on the approach
of winter;<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> he reached the Aisne and
proposed to encamp on its banks. But by
the advice of Count Godfrey of Hennegau,
who warned him of the dangers of a stream
specially liable to floods, he crossed with the
greater part of his army, leaving only, on the
dangerous side, a small party with the baggage.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
It was on this party that Lothar,
hastening on with a small force, fell suddenly,
while a sudden rise of the stream hindered
either attack or defence on the part of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
main armies.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Otto then sends a boat
across with a challenge, proposing that one
or the other should allow his enemy to cross
without hindrance, and that the possession
of the disputed lands should be decided by
the result of the battle which should follow.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
'Nay rather,' cried Count Geoffrey, probably
the famous Grisegonelle of Anjou, 'let the
two Kings fight out their differences in their
own persons, and let them spare the blood of
their armies.'<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> 'Small then, it seems,' retorted
Count Godfrey in wrath, 'is the value
you put upon your King. At least it shall
never be said that German warriors stood
tamely by while their Emperor was putting
his life in jeopardy.'<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> At this moment, when
we are looking for some scene of exciting
personal interest, the curtain suddenly falls,
and this, our most detailed narrator, turns
away from the fortunes of Emperors and
Kings to occupy himself with his immediate
subject, the acts of the Bishops of Cambray.<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>Putting all our accounts together it is hard
to say whether, in a military point of view,
the expedition of Otto the Second was a
success or a failure. If his design was to
take Paris, he certainly failed. If he simply
wished to avenge his own wrongs and to
show that Germany could not be insulted
with impunity, he undoubtedly succeeded.
In either case the political gain was wholly
on the German side. King and Duke acted
together during the campaign; but each, in
its course, learned to distrust the other, and
each found it expedient to seek the friendship
of the Emperor as a check against his
rival.<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> And more than all, the Imperial rights
over Lotharingia were formally acknowledged
by Lothar, and were not disputed again for
some ages.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>This campaign of 976 has a special interest
just now, as its earlier stages read, almost
word for word, like a forestalling of the
events of the present year of wonders.
How far its later stages may find their
counterpart in the great warfare now going
on, it is not for us to guess. But it is a campaign
which marks a stage in the history of
Europe. It is the first war that we can
speak of&mdash;a war waged between Germany
and anything which has even the feeblest
claim to be called an united France. When
Otto the Great marched against Paris and
Rouen, he was fighting in the cause of the
King of the West Franks, the lawful over-lord
of the Dukes against whom he was
fighting. When Otto the Second marched
against Paris, he was fighting against King
and Dukes alike, and King and Dukes between
them had at their call all the lands of
the strictly French speech, the tongue of
<i>oil</i>. Aquitaine of course, and the other
lands of the tongue of <i>oc</i>, had no part or lot
in the matter; then, as in latter times, there
were no Frenchmen south of the Loire.
But if the expedition of Otto was in this
sense the first German invasion of France, it
was also for a long time the last. It is not
often that Imperial armies have since that
day entered French territory at all. The
armies of Otto the Fourth appeared in the
thirteenth century at Bouvines, and the armies
of Charles the Fifth appeared in the
sixteenth century in Provence. But Bouvines,
lying in the dominions of a powerful
and rebellious vassal, was French only by the
most distant external allegiance, and Provence,
in the days of Charles the Fifth, was
still a land newly won for France, and the
Imperial claims over it were not yet wholly
forgotten. Both invasions touched only remote
parts of the kingdom, and in no way
threatened the capital. Since the election
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
of Hugh Capet made Paris for ever the head
of France and of all the vassals of the
French Kingdom, the city has been besieged
and taken by pretenders, native and
foreign, to the Capetian Crown, but it has
never, till our own century, been assailed by
the armies of the old Teutonic realm. The
fall of the first Buonaparte was followed by
a surrender of Paris to a host which called
up the memories alike of Otto of Germany
and of Henry of England. The fall of the
second Buonaparte is followed before our
own eyes by the siege of Paris, the crowning
point of a war whose first stages suggest
the campaign of the Second Otto, but which,
for the mighty interests, at stake, for the
long endurance of besieger and besieged,
rather suggests the great siege at the hands
of Sigefrith. But all alike are witnesses to
the position which the great city of the
Seine has held ever since the days of Odo.
Paris is to France not merely its greatest city,
the seat of its government, the centre of its
society and literature. It is France itself;
it is, as it has been so long, its living heart
and its surest bulwark. It is the city which
has created the kingdom, and on the life of
the city the life of the kingdom seems to
hang. What is to be its fate? Is some
wholly different position in the face of
France and of Europe to be the future doom
of that memorable city? Men will look on
its possible humiliation with very different
eyes. Some may be disposed to take up the
strain of the Hebrew prophet, and to say,
'How hath the oppressor ceased, the golden
city ceased!' Others will lament the home
of elegance and pleasure, and what calls itself
civilization. We will, in taking leave of
Paris, old and new, wind up with the warning,
this time intelligible enough to be striking,
of her own poet&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2">The Act for the Disestablishment and
Disendowment of the Irish Church was one
of great importance for what it did, but of
still greater importance for what it implied;
for in that measure there was a distinct legislative
recognition of certain general principles,
which are susceptible of far wider application
than to the particular case they
were invoked to sustain. It disposed, once
for all, of the fond fantasy that the State is
bound in its collective capacity to have a
conscience, and in obedience to the dictates
of that conscience, to impose its own creed
upon the community, as the established faith
of the country, to be supported by the authority,
and enforced by the sanction of law.
It acknowledged the principle that where an
established church never has been, or has
ceased to be the church of the nation, and
fails, therefore, in its professed function as
the religious instructor of the people, it has
no longer any <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>, and ought to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
swept away as an anomaly and encumbrance.
It recognised the fact, if not for the first
time, at least with more distinctness and emphasis
than was ever done before, that ecclesiastical
property is national property, which
the nation has a perfect right through its legitimate
organ, the legislature, to apply to
any purpose it may think fit, whether sacred
or secular.</p>

<p>We need not wonder that when the Irish
Establishment was abolished, men's minds
should turn almost instinctively to the sister
institution in Wales, as furnishing a case in
many respects parallel, but in other respects
still less admitting of justification. The discussion
of this subject in Parliament last session,
on the motion of Mr. Watkin Williams,
did not take place, perhaps, under the
most favourable auspices. But it was at
least attended with this advantage, that it
obliged those who oppose the Disestablishment
of the Welsh Church to show their
hand. As Mr. Gladstone, in addition to his
many other merits as an orator, is the most
accomplished debater in the House of Commons,
we may safely assume that whatever
could be said in defence of the Church in
Wales, and in deprecation of its proposed
severance from the State, was said by him
with the utmost degree of plausibility and
point. But certainly on a calm review of
the arguments he used on that occasion,
they do not appear to be very formidable.</p>

<p>It may be said, indeed, that the Prime
Minister made no attempt to defend the
Welsh Church. He abandoned it to the
strongest condemnation pronounced upon it
by its adversaries, for the 'gross neglect,
corruption, nepotism, plunder,' to use his
own words, by which it has been marked;
and only tried to account for these evils by
laying them all to the charge of 'Anglicizing
prelates.' He admitted that, even granting
what Churchmen claimed, namely, about one-fourth
of the population as belonging to the
Establishment,&mdash;a claim, let us say in passing,
which in the face of notorious facts is
simply preposterous&mdash;'the disproportion is
very remarkable in the case of a Church purporting
to be the Church of the nation.'
He admitted, moreover, as a circumstance
seriously militating against the Welsh
Church, that 'so large a proportion of her
members belong to the upper classes of the
community, the classes who are most able to
provide themselves with the ministrations of
religion, and therefore, in whose special and
peculiar interest it is most difficult to make
any effectual appeal for public resources and
support.' But while acknowledging all this,
he resists the proposal for its disestablishment.
On what grounds? First, on this
ground&mdash;that there is no hostility in Wales
to the Church Establishment, and that its
existence does not, as in Ireland, produce
alienation or bitterness of feeling between
different classes of the community. But this
argument, if it were well founded in fact,
which unhappily it is as far as possible from
being, does not address itself in the least to
the reason or justice of the case. Even if
the Welsh people were so devoid of spirit
and self-respect as to feel it no grievance to
have a costly Church Establishment, which
exists almost exclusively for the benefit of
the rich, saddled upon their necks, surely
that is no proof that it is right to perpetuate
the privileges of a body, whose history for
generations has been marked by 'gross neglect,
corruption, and nepotism,' and which,
purporting to be the Church of a nation,
does not pretend, even according to the
claims of its most audacious advocates, to
number among its adherents more than one-fourth
of the nation. But Mr. Gladstone is
wholly misinformed as to the fact. Because
the Nonconformists of Wales are an
eminently peaceable, loyal, and orderly people,
and do not proclaim their grievances
with clamour and menace, it is imagined that
they do not feel the gross injustice and indignity
of the position they occupy. They
do feel it deeply, and they are made to feel
it, by events continually occurring in their
social and political life, which all spring
from this one root of bitterness. We need
only refer in illustration of what we mean to
the circumstances which attended and followed
the last general election. Every form
of unfair pressure was brought to bear upon
the people to induce them to vote against
their convictions, and many of those who
had the courage to resist, were mercilessly
evicted from their holdings, or otherwise injured
and persecuted. All this sprang from
the existence of the Established Church, as
is evidenced by the fact, that in every instance
we believe without a single exception&mdash;the
oppressors were Churchmen and the
sufferers Nonconformists.</p>

<p>The other, and the only other, argument
of Mr. Gladstone is this&mdash;that except for
conventional purposes, there is really no
Church in Wales, that the Welsh Church is
only a part of the Church of England, and
cannot therefore be dealt with separately.
We confess we are not very much dismayed
by this difficulty; for we can remember the
time when the same reason was urged to
show the impossibility of touching the Irish
Church. Properly speaking, we were told
there was no Church of Ireland, but only
the united Church of England and Ireland&mdash;the
two churches having, at the time of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
the Union, been joined together by a compact
so solemn and binding, that Her Majesty
the Queen could not give her consent
to any measure for dissolving that compact,
without incurring the danger of committing
perjury and bringing her crown into jeopardy.
And as for providing legislation for
Ireland distinct from that of England, the
suggestion was scouted as an absurdity. Ireland
was as much a part of the United
Kingdom as Yorkshire or Lancashire, and
must be governed by the same laws. The
sense of justice, however, and the urgent
necessities of the case, triumphed over these
foregone conclusions.</p>

<p>There is one fact that gives a sort of sinister
unity to the religious history of Wales
through all its vicissitudes. It is this: that
the influence of its relations with England,
whether they were hostile or friendly,
whether under Saxon or Norman rule,
whether in Catholic or Protestant times, has
been, in this respect, uniformly disastrous.
We can only glance very briefly at the proofs
of this allegation. Without raising again the
controversial dust which envelopes the discussion
as to the time and manner of the first
introduction of Christianity into this island,
we may at least assume it as an admitted
historical fact, that early in the second century
the Gospel had been planted here, and
that long before the Saxon invasion there was
a flourishing Christian Church in Britain. In
the records of the first three or four hundred
years of its existence, we find that many large
collegiate establishments were formed and
dedicated to religion and literature. From
these institutions went forth men thoroughly
instructed in the learning of their times,
some of them bearing the fame of their
country's piety and erudition to the uttermost
parts of Europe. In the &oelig;cumenical
councils summoned under Constantine the
Great and his sons, in the third and fourth
centuries, at Arles, at Nice, and at Sardica,
to decide the great Donatist and Arian controversies
that disturbed the unity of the
Catholic faith, we are told that the
British Churches were represented by
men who bore an honourable part in the
defence of sound doctrine; for Athanasius
himself testifies that Bishops from Britain
joined in condemnation of the heresy of
Arius, and in vindication of himself. But
when, in the sixth century, the Pope sent
the celebrated Augustin, as a missionary, to
convert the pagan Anglo-Saxon inhabitants
of this island to Christianity, there came on
the British Church a time of terrible persecution.
Having resolutely refused to recognise
the papal authority, Augustin and his
successors, in accordance with the policy of
that persecuting Church which they represented,
incited their Saxon converts to make
war upon the British recusants, exasperating
the national animosities, already sufficiently
bitter between the two races, by adding to it
the fanatical frenzy of religious bigotry.
For many ages, therefore, the Britons were
liable to frequent incursions from their
Saxon neighbours, who, instigated by the
councils of Rome, invaded their country, destroying
their churches, burning their monasteries,
and putting to death the pious and
learned monks, who, in the seclusion of those
establishments, were pursuing the peaceable
occupations of literature and religion.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>
This struggle between the ancient British
Church on the one side, and that of Rome,
backed by the Saxon sword, on the other,
continued for centuries. And when the
Saxon conquerors had in their turn to succumb
to the Norman invaders, that struggle
was renewed with greater fierceness than
ever. Religion was again unscrupulously
used as an instrument of State, the Norman
princes forcing ecclesiastics of their own
race into all the higher offices of the Church
in Wales, not from any regard for the spiritual
interests of the people, but that they
might aid in extinguishing the national spirit
of the Cymri, and in subjugating the country
to the Norman yoke. This policy, of
course, failed, as it richly deserved to fail.
The bishops and other dignitaries thus intruded
upon the country were only safe when
surrounded by bodies of armed retainers,
and whenever the Cymric arms won a victory
in the field, the interlopers had to flee to
England to save themselves from popular indignation.
About the end of the twelfth
century, the Welsh princes appealed to the
Pope for a redress of these intolerable wrongs.
A petition couched in eloquent language was
presented to his Holiness from Llywelyn,
Prince of Gwynedd; Gwenwynwyn and
Madoc, Princess of Powys; Gruffydd,
Maelgwn, Rhys, and Meredith, sons of
Rhys, Prince of South Wales. It is curious,
in reading this document, to observe that
some of the ecclesiastical grievances of which
the British princes complain, are precisely
those which the friends of the Church in
Wales are still reiterating in our own day:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'And, first, the Archbishop of Canterbury,
as a matter of course, sends us English bishops,
ignorant of the manners and language of our
land, who cannot preach the word of God to
the people, nor receive their confessions but
through interpreters.</p>

<p>'And besides, these bishops that they send
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
us from England, as they neither love us nor
our land, but rather persecute and oppress us
with an innate and deep-rooted hatred, seek
not the welfare of our souls; their ambition is
to rule over us and not to benefit us; and on
this account they do not but very rarely fulfil
the duties of their pastoral office among us.</p>

<p>'And whatever they can lay their hands
upon or get from us, whether by right or wrong,
they carry into England, and waste and consume
the whole of the profits obtained from us, in
abbeys and lands given to them by the king of
England. And like the Parthians, who shoot
backwards from afar as they retreat, so do they
from England excommunicate us as often as
they are ordered so to do....</p>

<p>'Besides these things, when the Saxons (English)
rush into Wales, the Archbishop of Canterbury
puts the whole land under an interdict, and
because we and our people defend our country
against the Saxons and other enemies, he places
us and our people under judgment of excommunication,
and causes those bishops whom he sent
among us to proclaim this judgment, which
they are ready to do on all occasions. The
consequence is, that every one of our people
who falls on the field of blood, in defence of
the liberty of his country, dies under the curse
of excommunication.'</p>
</div>

<p>When the Reformation came, the influence
of the connection with England was, if
possible, still more disastrous on the religious
interests of Wales. 'The robbery in
times of peace,' says Mr. Johnes, 'proved
worse than the spoliation in the times of
war, and the rapacity of the Reformation
was added to the rapacity of Popery.' He
then describes, in language of eloquent indignation,
how the ecclesiastical endowments
of the Principality were pitilessly plundered
by being bestowed upon laymen, the descendants
of the Norman invaders, or by
being alienated from the Church of Wales to
endow English bishoprics and colleges! For
the last century and a half, again, the policy
of the civil and ecclesiastical authorities in
dealing with the Welsh Church has, it would
seem, been steadily directed to the extinction
of the Welsh language and nationality by the
appointment of Englishmen to bishoprics,
canonries, deaneries, and most of the richest
livings in Wales, in utter contempt of all decency.
And now when, by the legitimate
operation of a State establishment of religion,
nearly the whole nation has been alienated
from the Church, so that it has become a mere
encumbrance in the land, we are told that
Wales is so inseparably united with England
that it cannot expect to be rid of the
incubus until England has made up its
mind to deal with its own Church Establishment.</p>

<p>But what we have to do with most especially
at present is the Protestant Church
Establishment in Wales, and our indictment
against it is this, that at no period of
its history has it fulfilled, in anything approaching
to a satisfactory manner, its proper
function as the religious instructor of
the Welsh people. We have a chain of
testimonies in support of this allegation that
are unimpeachable as to their quality, and
of overwhelming force in their concurrence
and cumulation of evidence. We are anxious
to make this point clear, because the
line of defence that has been lately taken by
the friends of the Church of England in
Wales is to this effect. It is true, they say,
that towards the middle of the last century
the Church had fallen into a deep sleep, and
so afforded occasion, and to some degree excuse,
for the rise of Nonconformity, which
was previously almost unknown in Wales.
And then they point in vague and sounding
phrases to the golden age that preceded
that period of spiritual torpor, when
the Church, alive to her high mission, ruled
by native bishops, who understood the language
and commanded the confidence and
veneration of the country, comprehended
and cared for within her ample fold the
whole population of the Principality. Dissent,
we are assured, is in Wales an exotic
of quite modern growth, which, it is further
implied, will prove to have a very ephemeral
life, like Jonah's gourd, which came up in a
night and perished in a night. Now all this
is pure fiction. Dissent is not a thing of
modern growth in Wales. It has existed
more or less for 230 years, and whatever of
vital religion has existed there during the
whole of that period, has been owing far
more to its influence than to that of the Established
Church. It is not correct to say
that the Church 'fell asleep' in the last century,
simply because it had never been awake.
'The wisest thing, in my opinion, that our
Church friends can do,' said Mr. Henry
Richard, in his address at the opening of
Brecon College&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'instead of pluming themselves on their antiquity,
would be to cut off, so far as they can, all
connection with and all memory of their past
history in Wales. The succession through
which they derive their ecclesiastical lineage,
in this country at least, is about as unapostolical
a succession as can be conceived&mdash;a succession
of simony, pluralism, nepotism; of ignorance,
incompetence, and utter indifference
to the duties of their own high office and the
claims of the unfortunate people left to their
charge, on the part of those who called themselves
the priests of God.'</p>
</div>

<p>And to begin with what must surely be
considered as the first and most solemn
duty of a Protestant Church, that of supplying
the people of whom it professes to take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
charge with the Word of God in their own
language, how does the account stand with
the Welsh Established Church in this respect?
Dr. Llewellyn, the learned author of
the 'Historical Account of the Welsh Versions
of the Bible,' states</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'that for upwards of seventy years from the
settlement of the Reformation by Queen Elizabeth,
for near one hundred years from Britain's
separation from the Church of Rome, there
were no Bibles in Wales, but only in the cathedrals
of parish churches and chapels. There
was no provision made for the country or the
people in general; as if they had nothing to do
with the word of God, at least no further than
they might hear it in their attendance on public
worship once in the week.'</p>
</div>

<p>But how did the ecclesiastical authorities act
in reference to the translation of the Scriptures
into the Welsh language, even for use
in the churches? In the year 1563, an Act
of Parliament (5 Eliz. c. 28) was passed, ordering
this work to be done. In the preamble
it is recited,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'That her Majesty's most loving and obedient
subjects inhabiting within her Majesty's dominion
and country of Wales, being no small
part of this realm, are utterly destitute of God's
Holy Word, and <i>do remain in the like or rather
more darkness and ignorance than they were
in the time of Papistry</i>.'</p>
</div>

<p>It was therefore enacted that the Bible, consisting
of the New Testament and the Old,
together with the book of Common Prayer
and the Administration of the Sacraments,
should be translated into the British or
Welsh tongue. The duty of seeing this
done was devolved upon the Bishops of St.
Asaph, Bangor, St. David's, Llandaff, and
Hereford, and they were subjected to a penalty
of &pound;40 each if the work were not accomplished
by March, 1566. The New
Testament was translated within the given
period, principally by William Salesbury, a
lay gentleman, with some help from the
Bishop and Precentor of St. David's; but
there was no version of the Old Testament
for twenty years later, and that was done
not by the initiative or at the instigation of
the bishops, but by the spontaneous piety
and patriotism of one individual, Dr. William
Morgan, vicar of Llanshaidr-yn-Mochnat,
Denbighshire, whose name ought to be
held in everlasting veneration by all Welshmen.
This was published in 1588. He acknowledges,
indeed, that he received some
encouragement and help from the Bishops
of St. Asaph and Bangor. Ingenious apologies
have been urged for the gross neglect
of the bishops in fulfilling their commission.
But Dr. Morgan, in the Latin dedication of
his Bible to Queen Elizabeth, ascribes it to
what, no doubt, was the true cause, mere
'idleness and sloth.'<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> There was no other
edition of the Welsh Bible for thirty-two
years. But in the year 1620, Dr. Parry,
Bishop of St. Asaph, brought out a new
issue. This also seems to have been the result
of individual zeal, for in his preface Dr.
Parry says, that the former edition having
been exhausted, and many or most of the
churches being either without any or with only
worn-out and imperfect copies, and nobody,
so far as he could learn, even thinking of a republication,
he was moved to undertake the
work.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> This, likewise, was exclusively for use
in the churches. The first edition of the Bible
for popular use was published in an octavo
form in 1630, but does not seem to have
originated with the Church in any way. 'The
honour,' says Dr. Llewellyn, 'of providing
for the first time a supply of this kind for
the inhabitants of Wales, is due to one or
more citizens of London,' namely Mr. Alderman
Heylin, 'sprung from Wales,' and Sir
Thomas Middleton, also a native of the Principality,
and an alderman of London.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> For
the next half century there was only one
edition of the Scriptures in Welsh published
by Churchmen, a large folio of 1,000 copies,
for the pulpits of the churches. But during
the same period the persecuted Nonconformists&mdash;Walter
Cradock, Vavasor Powell,
Stephen Hughes, Thomas Gouge, and David
Jones&mdash;published nine editions, consisting
of about 30,000 copies of the whole Bible,
and above 40,000 of the New Testament separately.
During the subsequent half-century
(from 1718 to 1769) we acknowledge
with cordial gratitude that several large editions
were issued by the Society for promoting
Christian Knowledge, two of them at
the instigation of the Rev. Griffith Jones,
and one at the instigation of Dr. Llewellyn,
a dissenting minister. But let it be observed
that the former period, from the accession
of Queen Elizabeth to the beginning of
the eighteenth century, synchronises as
nearly as possible with the golden age which
some members of the Welsh Church fondly
believe to have existed in the history of that
institution.</p>

<p>But let us now enquire how, in other respects,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
the Established Church in Wales discharged
its duties as the teacher of the people.
In the absence of the Bible there was,
of course, all the more need for personal
earnestness and activity on the part of its
ministers in preaching the word and catechising,
and the regular and solemn administration
of all religious ordinances. But
how was it in this respect during the beatific
period, when, as some of the modern advocates
of the Church exultingly declare, there
was 'no dissent in Wales?' We will begin
our inquiries with the reign of Queen Elizabeth.
In the year 1560, Dr. Meyrick, Bishop
of Bangor, writes that he had only two
preachers in his diocese. Strype, in his
'Life of Archbishop Parker,' describes the
condition of the bishoprics of Llandaff
and Bangor, one in South and the other
in North Wales, about the year 1563, as
follows. The former had been two or
three years, in effect, void, and wanted
a vigilant bishop to manage that diocese.
But the great dilapidations had so
impoverished that see, that few who were
honest and able would be persuaded to meddle
with it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
As for Bangor (he continues), the diocese
was also much out of order, <i>there being no
preaching used</i>, and pensionary concubinacy
openly continued, which was allowance of concubines
to the clergy, by paying a pension,
notwithstanding the liberty of marriage granted.</p>

<p>... So that Wales being in an evil condition
as to religion, 'the inhabitants remaining
still greatly ignorant and superstitious, the
Queen left it particularly to the care of the
Archbishop to recommend fit persons for
those two sees now to be disposed of.'</p>
</div>

<p>In 1588, John Penry published his 'Exhortation
unto the People and Governors of
Her Majesty's Country of Wales,' every line
of which was aflame with the fire of a righteous
and eloquent indignation at the negligent
bishops and 'unpreaching ministers,' to
whose tender mercies his 'poor country of
Wales' was abandoned. We need not quote
at large from the melancholy picture he gives
in this and his other pamphlets of the state
of the Principality in that day, as his writings
have been rendered familiar to many
of our readers by Dr. Waddington's 'Life of
Penry,' and Dr. Rees's 'History of Nonconformity
in Wales.' We will therefore cite
only one or two pregnant sentences:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'This I dare affirm and stand to, that if a
view of all the registries of Wales be taken, the
name of that shire, that town, or of that parish,
cannot be found, where, for the space of six
years together within these twenty-nine years,
a godly and learned minister hath executed the
duty of teacher, and approved his ministry in
any mean sort.... If I utter an untruth
let me be reproved, and suffer as a slanderer;
if a truth, why should not I be allowed.'</p>
</div>

<p>The Rev. Henry T. Edwards, the author
of the very able and vigorous pamphlet
mentioned at the head of this article, has
permitted himself, in an evil moment, and
in stress of argument and information, in defence
of the Welsh Church of those days, to
describe this noble-minded and devoted
Christian and patriot in very opprobrious
terms, as 'a sour-minded Puritan, recognising
no truth save in his own interpretation
of the written Word,' &amp;c., &amp;c. But Strype,
at least, cannot be called 'a sour-minded Puritan.'
Let us then revert to his testimony
in reference to precisely the same period.
In his 'Annals of the Reformation'<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> he
makes the following statement. We borrow
Dr. Rees's summary:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'Dr. William Hughes, Bishop of St. Asaph,
was accused, in the year 1587, the year before
the publication of Penry's "Exhortation," of
misgoverning his diocese and of tolerating the
most disgraceful abuses. When the case was
inquired into, it was found that the Bishop
himself held sixteen rich livings <i>in commendam</i>;
that most of the great livings were in
possession of persons who lived out of the
country; that one person who held two of the
greatest livings in the diocese boarded in an
alehouse; and that only three preachers resided
upon their livings viz., Dr. David Powell, of
Ruabon; Dr. William Morgan, of Llanrhaidr-yn-Mochnat,
the translator of the Bible; and
the parson of Llanvechan, an aged man, about
eighty years old.'</p>
</div>

<p>We will now follow the history of the
Welsh Church into the reign of James I.
At that time, there lived and laboured in
Wales a very remarkable man, the Rev. Rees
Pritchard, Vicar of Llandovery, in Carmarthenshire,
the author of a work which has
had a larger circulation in the Principality
than any book except the Bible. It is entitled
'Canwyll y Cymry,' or, 'The Welshman's
Candle,' a series of moral and religious
poems, most simple in their language,
and even slovenly in their metrical composition,
but full of poetry and feeling, and
thoroughly saturated with evangelical truth.
He flourished between the years 1616 and
1644. John Penry, in his most vehement
remonstrances, does not employ stronger
language to portray the utter ignorance, irreligion,
and immorality in which the people
were sunk, than does this excellent clergyman.
But what we have specially to do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
with now is the testimony he bears as to the
condition of the Church, a testimony all the
more unimpeachable, as he continued through
life a member and a minister of that Church.
In one of his poems, after describing all
classes as wholly given up to every species of
depravity, he adds that the clergy were
asleep, leaving the people to wallow in their
sins, and to live as they liked, unwarned and
unrebuked.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> In another poem, he puts the
clergy at the head of various classes, whom
he enumerates, who were 'contending with
each other, which of them should most
daringly affront the Most High.' There is
evidence still more conclusive, if possible, in
the reports presented to the King by Archbishop
Laud, between the years 1633 and
1638, which are still extant among the Lambeth
MSS. This bigoted prelate had, it
seems, in those years, been specially instigating
the Bishops of St. David's and Llandaff
to persecute without mercy those in their
dioceses who were guilty of 'inconformity;'
that is, who refused to read 'The Book of
Sports,' and other similar obligations which
were laid on the consciences of the clergy.
After commemorating the success with
which the Bishop of St. David's had silenced
one Roberts, a lecturer, for inconformity, and
reduced three or four others to submission,
he adds: 'He complains much, and surely
with cause enough, that there are few ministers
in those poor and remote places that
are able to preach and instruct the people.'
And the Bishop of St. Asaph tells Laud that
'they were not anywhere troubled with inconformity;
but that he heartily wished that
they might as well be acquainted with superstition
and profaneness.'</p>

<p>In the year 1651, there was published a
translation in the Welsh language of the once
celebrated 'Marrow of Modern Divinity.'
This translation was by the Rev. John Edwards,
one of the clergy ejected by the Parliamentary
Commission appointed under the
Commonwealth. In the preface, he deplores
the neglect into which the Welsh language
had fallen, and declares that, 'among the
Church clergy (y Dyscawdwyr Eglwysig),
scarcely one in fifteen knew how to read
and write Welsh.' The reader will observe
that we are following our chain of evidence
link by link. In 1677, a work was published
in Welsh entitled 'Carwr y Cymry,' that is,
'The Welshman's Friend; an Exhortation to
his dear countrymen for the sake of Christ
and their own souls, to search the Scriptures
according to Christ's command, John v. 39.'
This is supposed to have been written by a
clergyman of the name of Oliver Thomas.
The introduction is in the form of an earnest
and affectionate address to 'Welsh Churchmen.'
In this he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'Often does sorrow beyond measure strike
my heart in observing and reflecting upon the
great deficiency and the utter neglect which
prevails among us Welsh Churchmen, in taking
pains to teach our flocks conscientiously,
through our not giving ourselves with full purpose
of heart to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.
We are ourselves, many of us, unskilful
in the word of righteousness, and therefore
incompetent to direct others.... Yea, my
dear brethren, give me permission to say, what
it pains me to be obliged to say, that in each
of the Welsh bishoprics forty or sixty churches
may be found without any one in them on Sundays,
even in the middle of summer, when the
roads are driest, and the weather finest.'<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>
</div>

<p>We have brought our chain of testimonies
down to near the end of the seventeenth
century. But from that time to our own
they are still more abundant.</p>

<p>In 1721 was published, 'A View of the
State of Religion in the Diocese of St. David's,
about the beginning of the Eighteenth
Century,' by Dr. Erasmus Saunders. It
contains a most deplorable picture of the
condition of the Church, as regards both its
material and spiritual interests. He describes
some churches as totally decayed;
they</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'do only serve for the solitary habitations of
owls and jackdaws; such are St. Daniel's,
Castelhan, Kilvawyr, Mountain, Capel Colman,
and others in Pembrokeshire; Mount
Llechryd, in Cardiganshire; Aberllynog, in
Breconshire; Nelso, in Gower, Glamorganshire,
and others in Carmarthenshire. And it
is not to be doubted, but as there are districts of
land, so there were originally just endowment
of tythes that did belong to all those several
churches; but whatever they were, they are
now alienated, the churches, most of them,
demolished, the use for which they were intended
almost forgotten, unless it be at Llanybrec,
where, I am told, the improprietor or his
tenant has let that church unto the neighbouring
Dissenters, who are very free to rent it for
the desirable opportunity and pleasure of turning
a church into a conventicle'&mdash;(pp. 23, 4.)</p>

<p>'As the Christian service is thus totally disused
in some places, there are other some that
may be said to be but half served, there being
several churches where we are but rarely, if at
all, to meet with preaching, catechising, or administering
of the Holy Communion. In others,
the service of the prayers is but partly read,
and that perhaps but once a month, or once in
a quarter of a year.... The stipends are so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
small, that a poor curate must sometimes submit
to serve three or four churches for &pound;10 or
&pound;12 a-year.'</p>
</div>

<p>He then refers, though with great forbearance
and tenderness, to the low type of
character which such a state of things produced
among the clergy; and then exclaims,
sorrowfully, 'Such is the faint shadow that
remains among us of the public service of
religion!'</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'And now,' continues the author, 'what
Christian knowledge, what sense of piety, what
value for religion are we reasonably to hope for
in a country thus abandoned, and either destitute
of churches to go to, or of ministers to
supply them, or both? Or how can it well
consist with equity and conscience to complain
of the ignorance and errors of an unhappy
people in such circumstances? They
are squeezed to the utmost to pay their
tithes and what is called the church dues
(though, God knows, the Church is to expect
little from it), and, at the same time, most
miserably deprived of those benefits of religion
which the payment of them was intended to
support, and delivered up to ignorance and
barbarity, which must be the certain consequence
of driving away the ministers of religion,
or of depressing or incapacitating them
for their duty'&mdash;(p. 26.).
</p>
</div>

<p>To aggravate the evils of all kinds already
sufficiently rife in the Welsh Church, the
English Government, about the beginning of
the eighteenth century, adopted the practice,
which it has continued ever since, of appointing
Englishmen utterly ignorant of the Welsh
language to Welsh bishoprics.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> And the
bishops, following the example thus set by
those acting for the head of the Church,
inundated the Principality with English
clergymen, their own relatives and connections,
to whom all the highest dignities and
the richest livings were, almost without exception,
assigned. A more monstrous abuse
than this it is difficult to conceive, and yet
it has been persevered in for 150 years in the
face of all complaint and remonstrance, and
in the teeth of the express judgment of the
Church itself, which declares in its 26th
Article that 'it is a thing plainly repugnant
to the word of God, and to the custom of
the primitive Church, to have public prayer
in the church, or to minister the sacraments
in a tongue not understanded of the people.'
We need not wonder, therefore, that great
prominence should be henceforth given by
the friends of the Church to this, as one of
the causes, if not, indeed, the sole cause, of
its inefficiency and decay. How far they are
justified in attaching such supreme importance
to it we shall consider hereafter. But we
shall for the present resume our series of testimonies
to the matter of fact. Most of our
readers will doubtless have heard of the Rev.
Griffith Jones, of Llanddowror, the founder
of the remarkable circulating schools, which,
during the latter half of the eighteenth century,
rendered such inestimable service to
the people of the Principality. We cannot
here enter upon the history of the life and
labours of this admirable clergyman. If one
man could have saved the Church in Wales,
he would have saved it. But as Mr. Johnes
has remarked with great sagacity&mdash;though
he does not appear to see the inevitable inference
to be drawn from the remark&mdash;'it is
a truth but too well sanctioned by experience,
that a few pious ministers are the
weakness, and not the strength, of an establishment,
when the majority of its ministers
are sunk in indifference to their sacred
duties.' Our object now, however, is merely
to cite the Rev. Griffith Jones as a witness
to the condition of the Church about the
middle of the eighteenth century. In the
year 1749 he published a letter in Welsh, on
the 'Duty of Catechising Ignorant Children
and People.' In that letter he observes that
the</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'peasantry cannot understand from sentences
of deep learning in sermons the Articles of
Faith without being catechised in them, which,
at present, is more necessary, because there is
among us such <i>monstrosity</i> (anferthwch) and
such evil and barefaced craft in some places,
as the frequent preaching of <i>English</i> to the
<i>Welsh</i> people, not one jot more edifying or less
ridiculous than the Latin service of the Papists
in France. One author states that he could
not help rebuking such clergymen, in spite of
the spleen and wrath it was likely to bring upon
him, viz., the lazy vicars and rectors, who have
led a careless life from their youth, and have
set their mind on keeping company, and going
unsteadily from tavern to tavern, and not minding
their books; in consequence of which they
are as ignorant of their mother tongue as they
are of Greek and Hebrew, and therefore read
the service and preach in English, without sense
or shame, in the most purely Welsh assemblies
throughout the country. Not much better, if
any, are those who patch up a sermon of mixed
language and jargon sounds, inconsonant, dark,
and unintelligible, to the great scandal and disgrace
of the ministry, and to the grief, damage,
and weariness of the congregation.'
</p>
</div>

<p>There is one other eminent Welsh clergyman
whom we must add to this cloud of
witnesses before we speak of the rise of Methodism
in Wales. The Rev. Evan Evans,
better known, perhaps, by his Bardic name,
<i>Ieuan Brydydd Hir</i>, was a man of learning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
and genius, a friend and correspondent of
Bishop Percy and other <i>literati</i> of that age.
He was especially well versed in ancient
British literature, and published a Latin essay,
<i>Dissertatio de Bardis</i>, containing Latin
translations from the poems of Aneurin, Taliesin,
and Llywarch Hen. In 1776, he
published two volumes of Welsh sermons.
To the first volume he prefixed a dedication
to Sir W. W. Wynn in English, and an
address to the reader in Welsh, in both of
which he describes in bold and burning language
the miserable state of the Church in
Wales at that time. Here is one out of
many extracts we might have given. After
complaining that most of the gentry had
'thrown away all regard for religion and
morality,' and that 'the ignorance and immorality
of the lower class of the people was
pitiful, owing to the slothfulness and neglect
of many of the clergy,' he thus proceeds:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'As for the clergy, such of them as still enjoy
the remaining emoluments of the Church
might do some good in their generation if they
were so disposed. But alas! so little has been
done by the clergy of the Established Church
in this way, that there is hardly a book or a
sermon left behind by any of them to testify
their fidelity in their vocation, for almost a
hundred years past. It is a pity they should
not do something to convince the world that
they are ministers of the gospel. And it is a
great pity that most of them are so <i>scandalously
ignorant of the language</i> in which they are
to do the duties of their function, that they can
do very little to the edification of their flocks.
Those who enjoy the richest benefices in the
Church are most deficient in this respect,
copying herein the Church of Rome very faithfully,
and leaving their sheep to perish. And
I am afraid that upon this and other accounts
many sincere Christians abhor the sacrifice of
the Lord, who were well disposed to the Church
established. And such abominations, if continued,
will make it desolate!</p>

<p>'Now, the question is what a faithful minister
of the gospel ought to do in such dangerous
times? I am very sure that some conscientious
ministers of the gospel have suffered
severely of late years under these lordly and
tyrannic prelates. The number of such disinterested
persons, it must be owned, was
small, and every art and method have been
used to discountenance them. If what I here
aver be doubted, I appeal to the writings of the
late pious and truly reverend Mr. Griffith
Jones, of Llanddowror, who underwent the
scurrilities of a venal priest <i>hired by the bishops</i>
to <i>bespatter him</i>, though he was by the special
grace of God without any stain or spot.
By far the greater number of the clergy, like
Gehazi, run after preferments, and have left
the daughter of Zion to shift for herself. And
his doom, in a spiritual sense, is likely to follow
them and their successors.'

<p>It is well known that the man who may be
called the father of Welsh Methodism was
Mr. Howell Harris. He was, and continued
to the day of his death, a dutiful son of the
Church. He applied for ordination, but
was refused. He pressed his request for six
years, but to no purpose. 'Wherever he went,'
we quote again the language of a Welsh
clergyman, 'as a simple and unoffending
preacher of the gospel, either in the South
or the North, he was denounced by the
clergy from their pulpits, he was arrested by
the magistrates, and persecuted by the rabble.<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
Now let us hear his own account of
the reasons which induced him to commence
and continue preaching to his countrymen.
He describes his being taken before
the magistrates at Monmouth, for the
work of God and the testimony of Jesus
Christ, and then continues&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'After this, I was more satisfied than ever
that my mission was from God, especially as I
had so often applied for holy orders, and was
rejected for no other reason than my preaching
as a layman. I saw both from Scripture and
the practice of the Church that the preaching
of laymen was proper in times of necessity; and
I thought that time of greater necessity could
hardly be than the present, when the whole
country lay in a lukewarm and lifeless condition.
<i>In many churches there was no sermon
for months together; in some places nothing
but a learned English discourse to an illiterate
Welsh congregation</i>; and where an intelligible
sermon was preached, it was generally
so legal, and so much in the spirit of the old
covenant, that should any give heed to it, they
could never be led thereby to Christ, the only
way to God. Seeing these things, and feeling
the love of Christ in my heart, I could not refrain
from going about to propagate the gospel
of my dear Redeemer.'<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
</p>
</div>

<p>The second great name in connection
with the rise of Methodism in Wales, was
the Rev. Daniel Rowlands, of Llangeitho, a
man whose powers as a preacher are described
by those who knew both, to have
surpassed even those of Whitfield. The effect
of his eloquence among his countrymen
was extraordinary. It ran like a stream of
electricity through the nation, kindling into
life thousands who had been previously
wrapped in spiritual torpor. Like Howell
Harris, he was not merely content, but anxious
to continue his ministrations in the
Church. 'But he was cast out of the Church
of England,' says one of his biographers, the
Rev. J. C. Ryle, 'for no other fault than excess
of zeal.' And what was the condition of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
the church, from which this over zealous
man was expelled by Episcopal judgment?
Mr. Ryle shall answer. 'This ejection took
place at a time when scores of Welsh clergymen
were shamefully neglecting their duties,
and too often were drunkards, gamblers,
and sportsmen, if not worse.'<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>The inference from all this has already
been drawn for us by a candid Churchman.
Mr. Johnes, in his 'Essay on the Causes of
Dissent in Wales,' says that he is irresistibly
led to the conclusion 'that before the rise
of Methodism in Wales the churches were as
little attended by the great mass of people as
they are now: and that indifference to all
religion prevailed as widely then as dissent
in the present day.' Of the early Methodists
in Wales, as indeed of the early Nonconformists,
it may be said most truly that they did
not leave the Church of their own accord.
Most of them clung to it with a most touching
fidelity, in spite of incessant persecution
and obloquy from those within its pale, and
were at last thrust out of it, for no offence
but the excess of their zeal for the moral and
spiritual improvement of their countrymen.
It is not necessary now to put in any defence
for these men; for it has become the fashion
of late among our Church friends in Wales,
while denouncing modern Nonconformity as
schismatic, turbulent, self-seeking, and other
choice epithets with which we are so familiar
in this connection, to speak with great tenderness
and respect of the founders of Welsh
dissent, and especially the early Methodists.
Retaining, of course, that <i>de haut en bas</i> air
of extreme candour and condescension which
any Churchman, however small, thinks it
right to assume when referring to any Dissenter,
however illustrious for capacity and
service, they do nevertheless admit that the
men in question were admirable men, full of
genuine zeal for evangelical truth and the
salvation of souls. Nor do they scruple to
deplore and censure the perverse policy which
persecuted such men and drove them from
the Church. Nay, in some cases, clergymen
have even become their admiring and eulogistic
biographers. But this is the old thing
over again. 'Ye build the tombs of the prophets
and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous,
and say, if we had been in the days of
our fathers, we would not have been partakers
with them in the blood of the prophets.'
But then, unhappily, by displaying the same
spirit towards the successors of these men,
and branding them with the same epithets
of contumely and reproach as their fathers
applied to <i>their</i> fathers, and that for doing
precisely the same work, they are witnesses
unto themselves that they are the genuine
children of them which persecuted the prophets.</p>

<p>Having brought our review down to the
great revival of religion about the middle of
the last century, let us now inquire what the
Church has done since that time to make up
for centuries of gross neglect or perfunctory
service. It might have been thought that
this stirring of spiritual life in the country,
through other agencies than its own, would
have roused it, were it from no better motive
than that of jealous emulation, to make
some effort to retain or recover its influence
over the population. And this, indeed, has
been the case to some extent within the last
quarter of a century. But for nearly a hundred
years after the appearance of Harris
and Rowlands, during which all bodies of
Dissenters were labouring incessantly for the
evangelization of the Principality, the Church
was settled on her lees. Her rulers not only
winked at for their own profit, but actively
maintained and promoted the existence of
abuses as audacious and monstrous as ever
dishonoured a Christian Church. Her clergy,
wholly abandoned to themselves, with
little or no episcopal supervision or stimulus,
were content with enjoying their temporalities
while they neglected their duties, leading
lives of mere worldly ease, and sometimes
much worse lives than that. If any
reader should imagine we are indulging in
exaggerations, we can refer him for exuberance
of proof to Mr. Johnes' most able and
admirable work, which we have already
mentioned. It was published in 1832, and
describes the state of things then in actual
existence. The sole object of most of the
alien bishops who had been and were in occupation
of the Welsh sees, seemed to have
been to provide for themselves and those of
their own households. Never was episcopal
nepotism carried to so daring an excess, with
this peculiar and enormous aggravation, that
'in Wales every relation of a bishop is in
language a foreigner; and his uncouth attempts
to officiate in his church in a tongue
unintelligible to himself, can be felt by his
congregation as nothing better than a profanation
of the worship of God.'<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> As a
specimen of how the chief pastors of the
Welsh Church acted in this matter, we subjoin
an extract from a speech delivered in
the House of Commons, in 1836, by Mr.
Benjamin Hall, afterwards Lord Llanover, a
gentleman whose name and memory ought
to be held in grateful and honourable remembrance
in the Principality, for the strenuous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
efforts he made in and out of Parliament
to remedy many flagrant abuses in the
educational and ecclesiastical institutions of
the country, and to procure something like
justice for Wales:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'What he complained of most was the unbounded
spirit of nepotism which seemed to take
possession of some of these English Bishops the
moment they took up this episcopal power in
the Principality. He found that in the diocese
of St. Asaph a relation of the late bishop held
the following preferments:&mdash;He was dean and
chancellor of the diocese, with the deanery
house, worth about &pound;40 a year; parish of Huellan,
&pound;1,500; St. Asaph, &pound;426; Llan Nevydd,
&pound;300; Llanvair, &pound;220; Darowain, &pound;120; Chancellorship,
from fees, &pound;400;&mdash;making &pound;3,006.
Besides all this, he was lessee of Llandegele
and Llanasaph, worth &pound;600, and this all exclusive
of the rectory of Cradley, in the diocese of
Hereford, &pound;1,200; vicarage of Bromyard, &pound;500;
prebend of Hereford, &pound;50; portion of Bromyard,
&pound;50 at present, but it is expected on the
death of an old life that this preferment will
be worth &pound;1,400. Thus he had no less than
<i>eleven</i> sources of emolument, producing between
six and seven thousand a-year. It appears also
that his brother had about &pound;3,000 a-year, and
the total enjoyed by relations of the late bishop
of the diocese alone, amounts to between seven
and eight thousand. But it appeared, moreover,
that the amount enjoyed by the bishop, and the
relations of the former bishops alone, amounts
to &pound;23,679, <i>and exceeds the whole amount enjoyed
by all the other resident and native
clergy put together</i>.'
</p>
</div>

<p>To what unseemly consequences the appointment
of English clergymen to Welsh
incumbencies must have led, our readers may
conceive by imagining a number of Frenchmen
installed in livings in England, and attempting
to perform the service in the English
language. Here are a few examples of the
ludicrous scenes often witnessed in Welsh
churches. They are taken from a speech
delivered in 1852 by the Rev. Joseph Hughes,
a very able clergyman, a native of the Principality,
but residing then at Meltham:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'The mistakes,' he says, 'that are made by
Anglo-Welsh clergymen, both in the reading-desk
and pulpit, are nearly as many as the
words in a Welsh glossary. Some of these
mistakes are of an absurd and revolting character,
and subversive of that due solemnity which
should be observed in the house of God. Yea,
the meaning of different words and sentences
of Scripture is often painfully associated in the
minds of the people with those mistakes.'
</p>
</div>

<p>Before citing these specimens, we may
premise that if any of our readers should be
acquainted with the Welsh language, they
will immediately perceive how probable it is
that the blunders described should have been
committed by an Englishman trying to read
Welsh, or rather, how next to impossible it
is that he should not have committed some
of them.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'Bishop Burgess, in pronouncing the blessing
in Welsh, used to say, "The peace of God
which passeth all vengeance." "Tangnefedd
Duw yr hwn sydd uwchlaw pob <i>dial</i>."</p>

<p>'A clergyman of the name of Lewis preached
at Chapel Colman, and while speaking of
man's depravity, said, "Every man is exceedingly
<i>tall</i> by nature." "Y mae pob dyn yn
<i>dal</i> iawn wrth natur." He meant to say blind&mdash;yn
<i>ddall</i>. The little men in the congregation
looked at each other with great astonishment,
and seemed to question the truth of the statement.
I was present at the time, and heard
this as well as other mistakes.</p>

<p>'The same clergyman, while officiating at
Llandygwydd, committed the following blunder:&mdash;He
made "Hail, King of the Jews," to
mean "<i>An old cow of straw, King of Ireland</i>."
"Hen fuwch wellt, Brenhin yr Ywerddon."</p>

<p>'Another, reading the words, "These things
are good and profitable unto men," gave them
this meaning, "These graves are good and
wordly to men." "I beddau hin si da a bydol
i dinion."</p>

<p>'Another Anglo-Welsh clergyman, in his
sermon quoting the words, "but the righteous
into life eternal," gave them the following sense,
"but to some chickens the food of the geese"&mdash;"ond
i rai cywion fwyd y gwyddau."</p>

<p>'A. B. officiating at &mdash;&mdash; and reading the
words, "let us here make three tabernacles,"
was understood to say, "let us here make
three <i>pans</i>, one for thee, one for Moses, and
one for Elias." "Gwnawn yma dair <i>padell</i>."</p>

<p>'A clergyman in the county of Pembroke,
while reading the funeral service, made it to
say, "it is sown the body of a <i>beast</i>." "Efe a
hoir yn gorph <i>anifail</i>."</p>

<p>'A late dean in North Wales, in repeating
the following beautiful lines,</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>"Ymddyrcha o Dduw'r nef uwch ben,</p>
<p>Daear ac wybren hefyd,"</p>
</div>

<p>"Be thou exalted, O God of heaven, above the
earth and firmament," gave them the following
interpretation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"<i>Arise O God above the head</i></p>
<p><i>Of two hens and the crows egg also</i>."</p>

<p><i>Dwy iar</i> ac <i>wy br&acirc;n</i> hefyd."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>'Another dean, addressing his work-people
at their drinkings, said, "<i>pori</i> yr ydych etto,"
"you are still <i>grazing</i>." His work-people not
perceiving that the blunder was unintentional,
thought their master treated them as brute
beasts, and were much offended.</p>

<p>'Another clergyman reading that part of the
"Venite," "In his hand are all the corners of
the earth," said, "In his hand are all the
afflictions of the earth," "<i>gorthyrmderau'r</i>

<p>'A clergyman reading, "The whole head is
sick, and the whole heart faint," was understood
to say, "the <i>back parts</i> are sick, and the

<i>middle of the back faint</i>." "Y <i>pen ol</i> sy

<p>'Another reading, "The crooked shall be
made straight, and the rough places plain,"
"A'r gwyrgeimion a wneir yn uniawn, a'r
geirwon yn ffyrdd gwastad," read it thus, "The
<i>crooked men</i> shall be made <i>straight</i>, and <i>the
rough men</i>, smooth ways;" leaving the women,
I suppose, still crooked and rough.'
</p>
</div>

<p>But while admitting, as who could hesitate
to admit, that the practice so long followed
of appointing Englishmen to all the higher
ecclesiastical offices in Wales, could not fail
to affect most injuriously the interests of the
Welsh Church, we must utterly demur, as
we have already intimated, to the exaggerated
influence ascribed by the modern defenders
of the Church to this circumstance, as
though it were the sole cause of its inefficiency.
For let us look a little more closely into the
matter. The period to which the advocates
of this theory are fond of reverting, as constituting
the ideal era of the Established
Church in Wales, when it was governed
principally by native prelates, is, speaking in
general terms, the interval between the accession
of Queen Elizabeth and the reign of
William and Mary, or to take the precise
dates, adopted by those among them who
have most carefully investigated the subject,
from the years 1558 to 1715. They specify
the names of twenty-four Welshmen elevated
to Welsh sees during these 257 years. But
what was done by these Cymric bishops for
the spiritual good of the Principality? Mr.
Johnes, whose work is the great repertory of
information on all matters connected with this
subject, mentions three out of the whole number
who seem to have distinguished themselves
by some service rendered to their country.
First, Bishop Morgan, who translated the
Bible into the Welsh language; but he did
this <i>not</i> as bishop, but as the vicar of a
small country parish in Denbighshire, and
he undertook the work precisely <i>because</i>
it had been neglected by the Welsh
prelates to whom it had been entrusted.
Second, Bishop Parry, who brought out a
new edition of the Bible for use in the churches.
Third, Bishop Owen, who succeeded
to the diocese of St. Asaph in 1629, and of
whom we are told that 'he began first by his
order and decrees, to establish preaching in
Welsh in St. Asaph parish church, and as it
is supposed, in other parish churches, in his
diocese. He repaired his cathedral at his
own cost, and set up a new organ in it;'&mdash;expressions
which evidently seem to imply,
that these very simple and obvious duties had
been neglected by his predecessors, though
they also were native prelates. We have, also,
seen a general statement that some of the
others established and endowed schools in
particular localities in Wales. Of most of
the rest we know nothing, but of some of
them we know something. We know of
Bishop Hughes, of St. Asaph, that he held
sixteen rich livings <i>in commendam</i>, and left
his diocese in the disgraceful condition already
described in the early part of this article. We
know that under Bishop Meyrick, of Bangor,
there were, by his own acknowledgment,
only two preachers in his diocese; and that
according to the testimony of Strype, the
grossest scandals were openly practised by
the clergy. We know that the four native
bishops, who by the Act of Elizabeth, of
1563, were charged with translating the
Scriptures into Welsh, so neglected their duty
as that even the churches were left without
Welsh Bibles for twenty-five years after that
date. We know that for seventy years after
the settlement of the Reformation, not a single
edition of the Bible in the Welsh language
was issued for the use of the people.
We know that from 1640 to 1690, which
forms a considerable portion of the vaunted
era of Welsh bishops, Churchmen published
only one edition of the Scriptures&mdash;a large
folio, for use in the churches&mdash;while during
the same interval the Nonconformists published
nine editions. We know that the
contributions of the 'native bishops' to the
moral and religious literature of the Cymry
are conspicuous by their absence. We have
examined with some care Rowland's 'Cambrian
Bibliography' ('<i>Llyfryddiaeth y
Cymry</i>'), containing an account of all books
published in the Welsh language from 1546
to 1800, and, between the years 1558 and
1715, the era of Welsh bishops, we have
failed to discover a single work written in
Welsh or translated into Welsh by any one
of these prelates, except 'A Letter to the
Welsh,' by Bishop Davies, introducing
Salesbury's translation of the New Testament.
Nor is there any proof that they
helped or promoted in any important degree
the publication of religious books in the
Welsh language, while the Nonconformists
of that age laboured indefatigably to enlighten
the people through the press. Even
Vicar Pritchard's work, 'The Welshman's
Candle,' left by him in manuscript, and
which, next to the Bible, had the greatest
influence on the religious character of the
country, was published by the care and at the
expense of Mr. Stephen Hughes, a Nonconformist
minister. But above all, we know
what was the state of the Church and the
country during, and at the end of, the reign
of this long dynasty of Welsh bishops. It
is described in the language already cited of
Strype, and Penry, and Pritchard, and Edwards,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
and Thomas, and Erasmus Saunders,
and Griffith Jones, and Howell Harris. And
we beg our readers specially to observe,
that all the witnesses we have summoned to
depose to the character and condition of the
Welsh Church during three centuries of its
history, have been members of the Church
itself. If there is one exception, it is
that of John Penry. But he also was born
in the Church, and baptized in the Church,
and ordained in the Church, for we are told
that he was 'a famous preacher of the University'
and he had, moreover, the honour
of being persecuted, imprisoned, and hung
by the Church. With that one doubtful exception
all the rest lived and died within its
pale. We might, of course, have added a large
number of witnesses from the ranks of Nonconformity,
whose testimony, we believe,
would have been quite as trustworthy. But
we have preferred omitting whatever might
be thought open to even the suspicion of
sectarian prejudice. Let us remember,
that several of the 'native bishops' lived
several years into the beginning of the
eighteenth century, and if they had exercised
so blessed an influence on the Church and
the country as it is now the fashion to affirm,
that influence could not have suddenly vanished
immediately after their death. <i>Nemo
repente fuit turpissimus</i> is surely as applicable
to a community as to an individual. And
yet we know by the confession of all candid
Churchmen, that when Griffith Jones and
Howell Harris began their labours&mdash;the
former in 1730, and the latter in 1735&mdash;the
Welsh Church was in a most lamentable
state of inefficiency and corruption.</p>

<p>The simple truth is, that the history of the
Welsh Church is only a crucial illustration of
the invariable and inevitable evils that attend
State establishments of religion. It is
true that in its case these evils appear in a
somewhat aggravated form, from the attempt
made by the English Government to treat
Wales as a conquered country, and to employ
the Church as an agent in the extinction
of its language and nationality. But when
the life of a Christian Church is made to
depend not on the faith, love, and liberality
of its own members, and the presence and
blessing of its Divine Master, but upon the
protection and patronage of the civil government,
and when, as a necessary consequence,
the administration of its affairs falls
into the hands of worldly politicians, who use
it as an instrument of State, what can be expected
but what always has ensued, that its
spiritual life should wither, until those who
seek real religious nourishment from its
breasts are driven in sheer desperation to
seek it elsewhere?</p>

<p>Indeed, it is curious that the friends of the
Welsh Church, while enumerating the secondary
causes which have led to her ruin, do not
find their way, which they may do by a
single step, to the right conclusion as to the
primary cause from which all the others
spring. Our Church, they say, has suffered
grievous injustice from the alienation of her
revenues, from the appointment of unqualified
persons to all her highest offices, from
the most flagrantly corrupt use of patronage,
from the neglect of native talent, from laxity
of godly discipline. But who has alienated
her revenues? The State. Who has
made those unfitting appointments? The
State. Who has exercised patronage so corruptly?
The State and its nominees, the
bishops. Who has overlooked native talent?
Again, the State and its nominees. Who has
neglected to enforce godly discipline? Still,
the State and its nominees. Yet, when it is
proposed to strike away the fetters which
bind them to the power that has thus maltreated
and oppressed them, they hug their
chains with frantic vehemence, and even use
them as weapons with which to assail those
who would fain assist in their liberation.</p>

<p>But let us now inquire into the condition
of the Church in our own day. And in the
phrase 'our own day,' we suppose we may
include a period of twenty-five years. We
have previously observed that, for a long
time after the revival of religion which stimulated
the Dissenters in Wales to such extraordinary
activity in providing the means of
religious instruction for the people, the
Church continued sunk in utter apathy. It
is impossible to find a more conclusive illustration
of this, than is afforded by the following
statement of the comparative progress
made in church and chapel accommodation
during the first half of the present century.
It is founded on the Census Returns
of 1851, and appears in Mr. Richards's 'Letters
on the Social and Political Condition of
Wales,' where it is cited on the authority of
a very accomplished statistician, the late Mr.
Plint of Leeds. North Wales, in 1801,
stood thus as to religious accommodation:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Church Accomodations" cellpadding="2">
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class="tdc">Sittings</td><td class="tdc">Proportion to all<br />
Sittings</td></tr>
<tr><td>Church of England</td><td class="tdr">99,216</td><td class="tdc">75&middot;2</td></tr>
<tr><td>All others</td><td class="tdru">32,664</td><td class="tdcu">24&middot;8</td></tr>
<tr><td>Total</td><td class="tdr">131,880</td><td class="tdc">100&middot;0</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In the fifty years following, the population
increased from 252,765 to 412,114, or 63
per cent. To have kept up the ratio of sittings
to population by each of these sections
of religionists, the former should have supplied
62,505 sittings, and it did supply 16,164.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
The latter ought to have supplied
20,576, and it did supply 217,928. The
Church of England fell short of its duty
73&middot;5 per cent., and all other denominations
exceeded it 950 per cent. The ratio of sittings
to population, which, in 1801, was
52&middot;1 per cent. (5&middot;9 less than the proper standard,
according to Mr. Horace Mann), was,
in 1851, 88&middot;9&mdash;that is, 30 per cent. above
it.</p>

<p>South Wales, in 1801, stood thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>The population increased from 289,892

sittings required of the Church was 140,854;
it did provide 15,204. The other denominations
ought to have provided 86,975; they
did provide 270,510. The Church of England
fell short of its duty 89 per cent.; the
other denominations exceeded it 211 per
cent. The ratio of sittings to population in
1801 was 74&middot;7 per cent., and in 1851, 84&middot;5.

<p>But we must descend a little more into detail,
and furnish some practical illustrations,
still taken from the testimony of Churchmen
themselves, as to the condition of their
Church in Wales in these modern times. In
1849, Sir Benjamin Hall made a speech in
the House of Commons, in which he described
the state of things at that time, especially
in the diocese of St. David's. He spoke
of the total neglect of archidiaconal visitations,
of the small number of services performed
in the diocese, and of the ruinous
and deserted state of the churches. Here
are a few extracts from his statement, taken,
we believe, from the Report of the Commissioners
on Education:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'No. 1. Kemys Hundred.&mdash;In the whole
country between Fishguard on the north, and
the Precelly mountain on the south, there is no
day-school, and the state of the church exemplifies
the neglect in which the population of
the parishes are left. The churches of Llandeilo
and Maenchlogag are in ruins. In that of
Morfyl the panes of the chancel window were all
out, the inside of the church wet, as if just
rinsed with water&mdash;indeed it had been, for the
afternoon was raining.</p>

<p>'No. 2. Hasguard.&mdash;School held in the church,
where the master and four little children were
ensconced in the chancel, amidst lumber, round
a three-legged grate full of burning sticks, without
funnel or chimney for the smoke to escape;
how they bore it I cannot tell. There had been
no churchwarden in the parish for the last ten
years, nor, it is believed, for a much longer period.</p>

<p>'No. 3. Llanafan Fechan.&mdash;Mr. Rees, farmer,
who lives close to the church, informed me that
divine service was very seldom performed here,
unless there are banns to publish, a wedding,
or a funeral.</p>

<p>'No. 4. Llandulais.&mdash;This church is a barn-like
building with large holes in the roof, evincing
every symptom of neglect and discomfort.</p>

<p>'No. 5. Llanfihangel Abergwessin.&mdash;No service
performed in this church five out of six Sundays
for want of a congregation.</p>

<p>'No. 6. Llanfihangel Bryn Pabuan.&mdash;Divine
service not often performed here, except a wedding
or funeral takes place. The vicar rides by
on a Sunday afternoon, but seldom has occasion
to alight and do duty, from the want of a congregation.</p>

<p>'No. 7. Llanfair tref Helygon,&mdash;The parish
church was in ruins many years ago; the oldest
inhabitant does not remember it standing.</p>

<p>'No. 8. Llandegley.&mdash;The clergyman is forbidden
to have his horses in the churchyard,
but he puts in two calves. The school is held
in the church, into which the belfry opens,
which is open to the churchyard. Calves are
still turned into the churchyard, and, I was
told, still sleep in the belfry.</p>

<p>'No. 9. Llangybi, four miles from Llanbedr
College, has neither doors nor windows. The
sacrament has not been administered for <i>ten</i>
years. Service seldom performed at all. Cows
and horses walk into the church and out at
pleasure.</p>

<p>'No. 10. Llanfihangel Ar Arth, also near
Llanbedr.&mdash;Here there was once a chapel of
ease; the stones of its ruins have now disappeared,
though a yew-tree marks the spot; and
the baptismal font was lately seen used as a
pig-trough. Yet the dissenters have five chapels,
and congregations amounting to 1,200.</p>

<p>'No. 11. Llandeilo Abercywyn.&mdash;The incumbent
is occasionally obliged to ring the church
bell himself; but sometimes the congregation
amounts to two or three persons.</p>

<p>'No. 12.&mdash;In another parish the vicar has
been in the Insolvent Court; and was also suspended
for three years for immorality, but allowed
to return. He has only a congregation
of about fifty, whilst the dissenters have four
chapels, with congregations of about 1,300.</p>

<p>'No. 13 Llandeilo Fach.&mdash;No service here for
about <i>ten</i> years. The roof has fallen down for
several years; but, fortunately, there is a dissenting
chapel, with a congregation of
about 300.</p>

<p>'No. 15. Llanddowror.&mdash;This parish is a
frightful demonstration of the destruction of
the Church in Wales by the present system.
About eighty years ago this parish was under
the pastoral care of a native Welshman, the excellent
and eminent Griffith Jones, renowned
for his piety, abilities, and qualifications. This
church had then 500 communicants, and people
came many miles to attend the service. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
this church has now no roof to its chancel, of
which it has been destitute several years. The
churchyard has neither wall nor fence; sheep
were seen standing on the church tower some
months ago. In one parish the curate has only
of late been suspended, of whom the parishioners
said he was "so bad the devil would
soon be ashamed of him." The vicar had not
preached in this parish for ten years, and lives
twenty miles off. He has had the care of the
parish since 1812, which is now reduced to the
above deplorable state, though formerly, when
in other hands, it was quoted as the model parish
of Wales.'
</p>
</div>

<p>Such was the aspect of the Church in the
diocese of St. David's only twenty years ago;
and we have no doubt there were scores of
other parishes in the same diocese in little
better condition than those specified in the
above extracts.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to look at another diocese.
In the year 1850 a vigorous effort was
made to promote church extension in the
diocese of Llandaff. An appeal was issued
in the form of a letter from the Archdeacon
of Llandaff to the Bishop, stating the facts
of the case, which were these. The population
of the two Archdeaconries of Llandaff
and Monmouth was 173,139. There was
church-accommodation for only 17,440. Let
our readers specially remark this fact. After
having been in possession of the country for
three hundred years, the Established Church
in that part of Wales did not pretend to
have made provision, in the year of grace
1850, for the religious instruction of more
than one-tenth of the vast population committed
to her care. But, did the people
avail themselves of her ministrations even to
that extent? The answer is at hand. Among
others to whom the appeal for help in building
new churches, founded on the above
showing, was sent, was Sir Benjamin Hall.
Before responding to that appeal, Sir Benjamin,
who was intimately conversant with
that part of the country, and who had his
doubts whether more church-accommodation,
scanty as it was, was really needed for
the district, instructed competent persons to
count the actual numbers who attended the
churches and the dissenting chapels in forty
of the parishes of the diocese on a given
Sunday. He published the result in a pamphlet,
in the form of a letter to the Bishop,
from which it appeared that, while the sittings
provided in the churches were 17,440, the
total number of actual attendants at the
most numerously-attended service on Sunday,
October 13th, 'the weather being particularly
fine,' was 7,229; while the number which
attended the 227 chapels provided by the
Nonconformists, in the same district, amounted,
on the same day, to 80,270. 'From the
above it appears,' says the writer of the
pamphlet, 'that so far from the churches
being too small to hold the remnant of
Churchmen which the zeal and activity of
Dissenters have not wrested from us, there
is, at present, room for 9,591 persons in addition
to those who now attend the divine
service of the Established Church.'</p>

<p>If we turn to one of the North Wales
dioceses, that of Bangor, it would seem that
even now, notwithstanding the energetic
efforts which the present bishop is known to
have made to infuse some life into the
church, its condition, according to the acknowledgment
of its own friends, is sufficiently
discouraging. At a meeting held in
Bangor last year, the bishop in the chair, a
lay churchman said that Anglesey has seventy-nine
parishes, fifty-two of which have no
parsonages. The seventy-nine parishes are
held by forty rectors; two of them possess
four livings each, eight of them possess three
livings each, and seventeen two each. He
said that the desirable thing for Anglesey
was the residence of the clergyman among
his parishioners. He declared that the
church there was now 'empty.' Another of
the speakers, Lord Penrhyn, acknowledged
that Dissent had prevented Wales from becoming
a heathen country. At a clerical
conference held in the same city in August,
1868, also under the presidency of the
bishop, the Rev. P. C. Ellis, Llanfairfechan,
in the course, we are told, of 'a very earnest
address,' made these remarks:&mdash;'He believed
if the Church of Ireland were disestablished
it would be a just judgment upon the clergy
of that church for their shortcomings, and
he was convinced that investigation would
show that the clergy of the church in this
country had fallen as far short of their duty
as their brethren in Ireland. He trembled
to think what the report of the state of the
Church in Wales would disclose, as he believed
its position was worse than that of
the Church in Ireland. If the Church in
Ireland were to go down, the Church in
Wales must surely follow.'</p>

<p>With regard to the number of persons
still attached to the Church in Wales, there
is great discrepancy of opinion. Without
pronouncing dogmatically on the subject, we
propose to furnish our readers with certain
data, which may assist them in drawing their
own conclusions. So far as we know, the
first, and we believe the most careful attempt
that was ever made to procure a return of
the ecclesiastical statistics of Wales, was in
1846, by Mr. Hugh Owen, Honorary Secretary
of the Cambrian Educational Society, a
gentleman to whom the Principality is indebted
for many valuable services. What
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
provoked that inquiry was this. About that
time the National Society was making a
strenuous effort to cover Wales with day-schools,
wherein, according to the fundamental
regulations of that Society, 'the children
were to be instructed in the Holy Scriptures,
and the liturgy and catechism of the Church
of England, such instruction to be subject to
the superintendence of the parochial clergyman;'
'the children to be assembled for the
purpose of attending service in the parish
church;' 'the masters and mistresses to be
members of the Church of England,' &amp;c.
A special appeal was issued on behalf of
Wales by Archdeacon Sinclair, with a view
'to raise a large fund' to establish schools
on the above principles. In this appeal, the
suggestion 'to adopt a broad basis in which
all sects could unite,' was sternly rejected.
No system 'from which the characteristic
doctrines of the Church of England were expunged'
could be tolerated for an instant.
To show how utterly unsuited to the country
schools of this description must prove to
be, the inquiry of which we speak was instituted.
Having obtained, through means of
the relieving officers, the names and addresses
of trustworthy persons in about
three-fourths of the parishes in Wales, Mr.
Owen addressed a circular to each of those
persons, requesting a return of&mdash;1. The
name of every place of worship in his district.
2. The name of the denomination to
which it belonged. 3. The exact number of
the congregation at each place of worship on
the first Sunday after the receipt of the circular,
in the morning, afternoon, and evening.
4. The exact number attending the Sunday-school
at each place, morning and afternoon.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
Returns were received from 392
parishes, thirty of which were in Anglesey,
fifty-nine in Carnarvonshire, fifty-three in
Denbighshire, seventeen in Flintshire, twenty-three
in Merionethshire, twenty-eight in
Montgomeryshire, twenty-seven in Breconshire,
fifty-four in Cardiganshire, forty in
Carmarthenshire, eighteen in Glamorganshire,
forty-three in Pembrokeshire, and ten
in Radnorshire. The population of these
392 parishes amounted to 431,000. As the
total population of Wales, not including
Monmouthshire, was then only 911,603, that
of the returned parishes contained nearly
one-half of the whole population of the
country. The result is thus summarized in
a pamphlet published soon after:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'From the returns it appeared that the number
attending the morning services of dissenters
were 79,694, the morning service of the church,
only 18,128, being more than four dissenters
to one churchman; the afternoon services of
dissenters were attended by 63,379, those of
the church by 5,710, or about seven dissenters
to one churchman. The evening services of
the church were attended by 9,889, and those
of dissenters by 128,216, or twenty-two dissenters
to one churchman. The average attendance
on the Sunday was&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Average Attendance">
<tr><td>Churchmen</td><td class="tdr">11,242</td></tr>
<tr><td>Dissenters</td><td class="tdru">90,415</td></tr>

<tr><td>Total average attendance</td><td class="tdr">101,657</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Hence the average attendance of dissenters as
compared with churchmen was as eight to one.</p>

<p>'The actual morning attendance at dissenting
Sunday-Schools was 40,641, at the church
schools 3,396, or in the proportion of twelve to
one. In the afternoon, the dissenters' schools
were attended by 57,243, the church schools
by 6,002, or more than nine to one, giving an
average proportion of eleven to one in favour
of dissenting schools.'
</p>
</div>

<p>It may be objected that as there were
probably many churches in which only one
service was held, the deduction, from the
average of three services, may be unfair.
Well, let it be noticed that the maximum
number attending the churches is in the
morning, when it amounts to 18,128; and
that the maximum number attending the
dissenting chapels is in the evening, when it
amounts to 128,216; hence the ratio of the
maximum attendance at dissenting chapels
(evening service) to the maximum attendance
at the churches (morning service) is seven to
one. But leaving out of account for the
moment the relative proportions of Church
and Dissent, as indicated by these returns,
what do they tell us of the absolute number
of persons attached to the Church, as compared
with the population? Instead of
taking the average attendance at three services,
we will, as before, take the number
present at the most numerously attended,
namely, the morning service; and if we add
to that number one-fourth to represent absentees,
we shall have a total of 22,660 souls.
This, in a population of 431,000, would
amount to rather more than one in nineteen
of church-goers.</p>

<p>But let us now turn to the official census
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
of 1851. We have not the slightest wish to
impeach the general accuracy of the facts
and figures given in Mr. Horace Mann's
masterly report. But the condition of
Wales is very peculiar, and the general rules
laid down by that eminent statistician for
classifying and formulating the immense
mass of figures with which he had to deal,
while fair enough, no doubt, to the normal
state of society in England, may not have
been equally applicable to a country in so
exceptional a state as Wales.</p>

<p>That a serious error has crept in somewhere
into the returns, as respects the
Principality, is obvious from this one fact.
The number of sittings provided by the
Church of England is stated to be 301,807,
and the number of the worshipping population
of the same church on the 31st of
March, 1851, is stated to be 138,719. Now
Mr. Mann shows that the proportion per
cent. of attendants to sittings in the Established
Church, throughout all England and
Wales, is only thirty-three; whereas by the
above showing, the proportion of attendants
to sittings in Wales alone is 40 per cent.
We venture to say, that no man competently
acquainted with Wales, knowing, as every
such man must know, the miserably meagre
attendance at hundreds of churches in that
country, would for an instant believe that
the churches are occupied in the proportion
of 40 per cent. of attendants to sittings.
Let us, however, take the figures given to us
in the census. The population of Wales,
including Monmouthshire, in 1851, was
1,188,914. The total number of places of
worship was 4,006, which was distributed
thus:</p>

<p class="center">PLACES OF WORSHIP.</p>

<table summary="Places of Worship">
<tr><td colspan="3">Of the places of worship&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>The Established Church furnished</td><td class="tdr">1,180</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Nonconformists</td><td class="tdru">2,826</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td class="tdr">4,006</td></tr>
</table>

<table summary="Sittings">
<tr><td colspan="3">Of the sittings (including estimates for defective return)&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Established Church furnished</td><td class="tdr">301,897, or</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;30 per cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Nonconformists</td><td class="tdr">692,239, or</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;70 per cent.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>It appears thus, that the Church had provided
sittings for only 25 per cent. of the
population, while the Nonconformists had
provided sittings for nearly 59 per cent.</p>

<p>But how about attendance? According
to Table B. of the Census of Religious Worship,
the greatest number by very far of attendants
at the services of the Established
Church on the Census Sunday was in the
morning. The number was 100,953. If
we add one-fourth to this number for the
absentees, we have 126,191, which represents
10&middot;6 per cent., not quite one in nine
of the population.</p>

<p>But these facts, sufficiently remarkable as
they are in themselves, give really but an
imperfect impression of the real magnitude
of the anomaly which exists in Wales. An
Established Church is presumably a <i>national</i>
Church, and rests its claim to being established
on the ground of its being national.
Above all, it ought to be <i>par excellence</i> the
poor man's Church, as some of the friends
of the English Establishment are wont to
allege, with what truth we pause not now to
inquire, that theirs is. But in Wales the
Church is not only not national, but it is
anti-national; and the whole policy of its
rulers for at least a hundred and fifty years
has been inspired by a prejudice as stupid
as it was mean against, the Welsh nationality
and language. At present, of the small
remnant of the population which still remains
within its pale, by far the larger
part are either English immigrants into
Wales, or that portion of the Welsh people
which have become Anglified in their
feelings and tastes; and instead of being the
poor man's Church, that of Wales is emphatically
and almost exclusively the rich
man's Church. There are scores, we might
safely say hundreds of churches, in which,
if the clergyman's family and the squire's
family, and their few dependents and parasites
were removed, there would be absolutely
no congregation at all.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone lamented, as members of
the Welsh Church also sometimes profess
to lament, the want of accurate and trustworthy
information as to the real facts of
the case as regards the several religious
opinions in Wales. But whose fault is that?
There would be no difficulty whatever, in a
small country like Wales, in obtaining perfectly
accurate information as to the number
of adherents to the church, if that body
were to follow the example of the principal
Nonconformist denominations in the Principality,
who collect and publish periodically
statistical returns of the members of their
churches, and the attendants at public worship.
But the clergy of the establishment,
clinging tenaciously in the face of notorious
facts to the fond fancy that theirs is the national
church, however small a fragment of
the nation really belongs to it, decline to
give us the number either of their communicants
or of those who habitually frequent
their churches. We are driven therefore to
look for such incidental indications of the
real state of the case as may come within
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
our reach. Some of these, however, are
very significant. In the National Society's
report for 1866-7 there is a return given of
the number of persons attending Church
Sunday Schools in Wales. They amounted
to 49,358, or 4 per cent. of the population.
The number found in Dissenting Sunday
Schools, according to the printed year books
of the various denominations on the same
year, was 351,128, or 29 per cent. of the
population, thus showing the Church Sunday
scholars to be one-eighth of the entire number.
These returns are all the more valuable,
because in Wales it is not the children merely
that attend the Sunday schools, but a very
large proportion of the adult population
also.</p>

<p>Very striking revelations have been made,
likewise, in connection with Day Schools in
Wales, tending to throw much light on the
actual and comparative strength of the
church. When the committee of Council
on Education began to make grants for the
erection of schools, there was a great rush
of applicants from the friends of the Established
Church in Wales. They had many
advantages in their favour for undertaking
the work of establishing Day Schools. They
had nearly the whole land and a great proportion
of the wealth of the country in their
possession. As they drew the means for the
support of their clergy, the fabrics of the
church, and public worship&mdash;which the Dissenters
had to provide out of their own pockets&mdash;from
the national endowments, they had all
their resources at liberty to devote to the work
of education. The administrators of the national
fund were their partial friends, and
dispensed it with a lavish profusion, with
little or no inquiry into the fitness of those
who applied, to direct and control the education
of such a population as that of Wales.
The National Society, as already shown,
made an appeal, which was liberally responded
to, for a special fund in which the co-operation
of England was solicited, to promote
'the education of our fellow-countrymen
throughout Wales in the principles of
our common church.' Our friends of the
Establishment, moreover, were restrained by
no scruple whatever from receiving public
money to any extent for teaching their own
peculiar tenets in day schools, while the
Dissenters conscientiously refused the proffered
grants of Government aid for religious
instruction. This sudden access of educational
zeal sprang avowedly in great part
from proselyting motives. The Bishop of
St. David's, in one of his early charges, adverting
to the peculiar condition of the
Principality, confessed that the existing
generation was hopelessly alienated from
the church, but that the next could and
must be recovered by attending to the education
of the young. The result of this
effort was that State-aided Church schools
sprang up in all the larger towns and villages,
and in many remote hamlets, and that often
in places where there were not half-a-dozen
church children.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> In these schools the
principles of the National Society were
rigidly enforced. All the children were
taught the Church catechism, and obliged
to attend church on Sundays. But State-aided
schools were liable to inspection, and
the inspectors had to present their reports
to the Committee of Council, and these
were laid before Parliament and the public.
It was not possible, therefore, in reporting
on the state of education in Wales, wholly
to conceal the fact, that an enormous majority
of the people held religious views different
from those held by the class who in
many places had undertaken to direct their
education. This has often come out in the
reports of even Church of England Inspectors.
Thus the Rev. Longueville Jones, who
was inspector of Church schools in Wales
in 1854, says:&mdash;'The number of children
in Welsh schools whose parents belong to
the Church is so very small, that it requires
great experience and delicacy of feeling to
treat their young minds as they should be.'<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
As an illustration of the difficulty with
which this gentleman had to contend, it is
only necessary to refer to the statistics he
gives of one school under his inspection, in
which out of 107 children, only five were of
parents belonging to the Church, whilst in
the following year the same school contained
144 children, of whom two only were of
church-going parents. To come down to a
later period in the report of the Rev. S.
Pryce, Inspector of Church of England
Schools for Mid-Wales, for 1868, we find
the following admission:&mdash;'The number of
children attending the Welsh country schools
I visit, is great beyond all proportion when
compared with the number of persons attending
church.'<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>Among the inspectors of British schools
in Wales was and is Mr. J. Bowstead. We
believe that Mr. Bowstead is himself a churchman.
But he is a liberal and candid churchman.
When, therefore, in the discharge of
his office, he began to visit the country, some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
eighteen or twenty years ago, he was forcibly
struck with the singular anomaly he
found to exist, of a large number of Church
schools in some cases liberally subsidized
from the public funds, and in others supported
by deductions from workmen's
wages, planted among a population of Dissenters,
who felt the strongest repugnance
to much of the religious teaching forced on
their children in such schools. He had the
courage in his reports to expose this injustice,
for which he has been ever since the
<i>b&ecirc;te noire</i> of the Welsh bishops and clergy,
who often assail him with great acrimony
and conspicuous unfairness. But on the
other hand, he has the satisfaction of knowing
that he has won the enthusiastic gratitude
of a whole nation, who owe to him, in
a main degree, the exposure of a flagrant
wrong from which they had been long suffering,
with little hope of deliverance. Well,
Mr. Bowstead, after extensive and careful
inquiry, in order to show the aggravated
character of the anomaly of which he complained,
ventured to say that <i>nine-tenths of
the common people</i> in Wales were Nonconformists.
A writer in the April number of
the <i>Quarterly Review</i> has assailed him
very angrily, and has accused him of 'asserting
without a shadow of proof that <i>nine-tenths
of the Welsh people</i> are Nonconformists.'
In a pamphlet issued for private circulation,
Mr. Bowstead has with just severity
first rebuked his assailant for perverting
his words, and then shown how little foundation
there is for the charge of his having
asserted without 'a shadow of proof,' what
alone he did assert, that nine-tenths of the
common people of Wales, of such people as
use elementary schools, are Nonconformists.
Now for the proof of this allegation. When
Sir John Pakington's committee was sitting
in 1865-6, Mr. Bowstead was one of the
witnesses summoned to give evidence. He
had been asked to procure the best information
he could, as to the comparative numbers
of children of church people and children
of Dissenters in the schools he visited.
He had no difficulty in getting at this from
the school register, because the name of the
Sunday school which each child attends is
entered in a column provided for the purpose,
a very satisfactory index of the denomination
to which its parents belong.
And what was the result? He received returns
from thirty schools, 'which were the
only elementary schools in their respective
localities. These thirty schools had an aggregate
of 6,799 children under instruction,
and of these 756 were returned as belonging
to the Church. The children of parents attached
to the Church formed, therefore,
about 11 per cent. of the whole, and the
children of Nonconformists constituted the
remaining 89 per cent. But Mr. Bowstead
supplies us with more recent evidence, which
we give in his own words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'I have not on this occasion attempted to
obtain returns from so wide an area as in 1866;
but I have secured very complete and reliable
returns, upon a considerable scale, from a locality
which embraces some 20,000 inhabitants,
all of whom are brought together by the industrial
operations of one large Company; and all
of whose children, so far as they belong to the
working classes, receive their education in
schools promoted by that Company. The locality
is Dowlais, which in the matter of education
is the Prussia of South Wales. It has
an admirable system of schools, embracing not
only unsectarian Protestant schools for the
bulk of the community, but also Roman Catholic
schools for the Irish. Nearly one-sixth of
the whole population may be found on the registers
of these schools at any moment, and I
should think there is scarcely a child in the
place that does not receive some amount of
schooling, whilst those of them who stay long
enough at school secure a very thorough elementary
English education, together with some
instruction in the French language and in
drawing. I know of no place where the
schools reproduce so complete a picture of the
population around them, or where the free
play of all the social forces presents so true a
type of the characteristic features of the working
men of the district.'
</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Bowstead then subjoins a table showing
the number of children belonging to
each denomination, in attendance at the
Dowlais schools: out of a total of 2,933,
those belonging to the Established Church
are 266. 'The Church children therefore
would be almost 7&middot;7 per cent., or one-thirteenth
of the whole, and the Nonconformists
would claim the remaining twelve-thirteenths.
This gives a larger proportion to the Nonconformists
than any former return.' Accompanying
this return there is a letter from
Mr. G. T. Clark, the manager of the Dowlais
works, containing two or three sentences
which are of great significance and value.
In sending the tabular statement just referred
to, Mr. Clark remarks:&mdash;'The proportion
of the several sects may, I think, be
taken as typical of the manufacturing population
of South Wales and Monmouthshire.'
We must quote two or three other sentences
from Mr. Clark's letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'I see a great deal is said about the disposition
of the Welsh Dissenters to allow their
children to attend Church schools. We have
both Church and neutral schools in this district,
and I believe the Church schools of my
friend and neighbour the Rector of Gelligaer
to be as good as any semi-rural Schools in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
Wales, and they are largely attended by the
children of Dissenters. But this is not from
love of the Church, but because they desire
education, and the district has no other schools.
The Welsh, in this respect, like the Scotch,
have a craving to get on, and they will make a
sacrifice to educate their children; and if the
only accessible school be a Church school, to
it they will apply. They trust and safely trust
to the domestic example, and to the Sunday
teaching in the chapel, and chapel school, to
keep the children in the special faith of their
parents.... Those who say that the
South Wales manufacturing population have a
regard for the Church of England speak in
utter ignorance of the matter. Their dislike
to the Church, as an establishment, is very
strong, and is yearly becoming stronger.'
</p>
</div>

<p>It would be difficult to find a more competent
and trustworthy witness. Mr. Clark is
himself an attached member of the Church
of England. He is a gentleman of rare intelligence,
who has for many years been at
the head of one of the largest and best conducted
of the great iron works of South
Wales. His knowledge of the population
of the whole district is extensive and accurate.
His testimony therefore as to the
comparative number of Churchmen and Dissenters,
and the feelings of the Nonconformists
towards the Establishment, must be
held to be unimpeachable.</p>

<p>But what is the comparative progress in
accommodation for worship made by the
Church and the Nonconformists since the
Census of 1851? We have the materials
for an approximate estimate. The Bishop
of Llandaff, in his last charge, delivered in
August, 1869, states that since 1849, the
number of new churches erected in his diocese
is thirty-nine, not quite two churches in
the year; and the number of churches rebuilt
on the same site, but whether enlarged
is not stated, is thirty-six, making a total of
seventy-five. Against this we have to place
the following return, furnished to us in detail,
but of which we can here give only a
summary, of what has been done in the
same diocese by three Nonconformist bodies
since 1850:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="New churches">
<tr><td>Number of new chapels built by the Independents</td><td class="tdr">68</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>Number of ditto rebuilt and enlarged</td><td class="tdru">46</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>

</table>

<p>Let it be observed that this showing includes
only the three principal Nonconformist
denominations, as we have failed to
procure returns of the different bodies of
Wesleyan Methodists and other minor sects,
which would make undoubtedly a considerable
addition to the total increase of dissenting
accommodation. And yet how
does the comparison stand even with such
incomplete elements as we possess? We
find that the Nonconformists have built 186
new places of worship against thirty-nine
built by the Church, and have rebuilt and
enlarged 127 more against thirty-six rebuilt
by the Church.</p>

<p>With regard to the whole of Wales, our
information as respects what the Church has
done during the last twenty years, is not so
perfect as we could wish. The number of
new churches built in the four dioceses appears,
as nearly as we can calculate from the
data within our reach, to be about 110.
But there is more difficulty in getting, at
those rebuilt and enlarged, as in one of the
returns (that of St. Asaph) we find churches
'restored' and 'improved'&mdash;words implying
merely repairs of existing fabrics without
any additional accommodation&mdash;mixed
up with those which have been 'rebuilt
and enlarged.' We have the precise number
rebuilt, and we are willing to presume
somewhat enlarged, in Llandaff, which is
thirty-six, and in Bangor, which is thirty-one.
We think it would be a liberal allowance
from the statistical report before us to
assign thirty-five 'enlarged' churches to St.
Asaph, and judging by the number of new
churches built in St. David's, we presume
that thirty 'enlarged' churches would cover
all that has been done in that diocese, making
a total rebuilt and enlarged of 132. Let
us now turn to the Nonconformists. The
following are facts on the substantial accuracy
of which our readers may rely.
Since 1850, the Calvinistic Methodists have
built 321 new chapels, and have rebuilt and
enlarged 435 more, providing additional accommodation
in all for 123,881 worshippers,
at a cost of &pound;366,000. The Independents,
during the same period, have built 118 new
chapels, and have rebuilt and enlarged 200
more, furnishing additional accommodation
for 130,000, at a cost of &pound;294,000. The
Baptists have built 142 new chapels, and rebuilt
and enlarged ninety-nine more, furnishing
additional accommodation for 81,800, at
a cost of &pound;163,000. Thus, these three denominations
alone have in twenty years built
581 new chapels, and rebuilt and enlarged
734 more, providing accommodation for
308,681 persons, at a cost of &pound;823,000.</p>

<p>But it must be further observed, that it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
not merely in the matter of religious instruction
that the Nonconformists have become
almost exclusively the leaders of the Welsh
people. As respects literature and science,
and all important social and political movements,
it is the same. The literature of
Wales, and not its religious literature merely,
is almost wholly Nonconformist. There
are about thirty periodicals, quarterly, monthly,
and weekly, at present published in the
Welsh language. Of these all but three are
owned and edited by Dissenters. There are
nine commentaries on the whole Bible, and
nine besides on the New Testament alone,
some original and some translated from
English, and only two of these were done
by Churchmen, and even they were Dissenters
when they began their work. There are
eight Biblical and Theological Dictionaries,
and as many bodies of divinity or systems
of theology, and no Churchman, we believe,
has had a hand in the production of any one
of them. There is a History of the World,
a History of Great Britain, a History of
Christianity, a History of the Church, a
History of the Welsh Nation, a History of
Religion in Wales, all by Dissenters, besides
elaborate denominational Histories of the
Calvinistic Methodists, the Independents,
the Baptists, &amp;c. Indeed, all the ecclesiastical
histories in the language are Nonconformist,
and all the general histories except
the History of Wales by the Rev. Thomas
Price, and a small work called the 'Mirror
of the Principal Ages.' There is a valuable
work illustrated by many excellent maps
and diagrams, entitled 'The History of
Heaven and Earth,' treating of geography
and astronomy, by the Rev. J. T. Jones, of
Aberdare, formerly a Nonconformist minister.
There is another large geographical
dictionary in course of publication by a dissenting
minister. There are two copious
Biographical Dictionaries edited and principally
written by Dissenters. There is now,
and has been for several years, in course of
publication an Encyclop&aelig;dia in the Welsh
language (Encyclop&aelig;dia Cambrensis), dealing
as such works do with the entire circle
of human knowledge. It was described by
the late Archdeacon Williams, who had seen
the earlier volumes, as 'a work of great promise,
as sound in doctrine as it is unsectarian
in principle.' It is studiously free
from denominational taint, and was intended
to be a great national undertaking, the contributors
being indiscriminately selected
from the ablest writers of all denominations,
the combined learning and talent of Wales
being thus engaged in its preparation. The
enterprising publisher at the outset addressed
a letter to all those among his countrymen
of whatever church or creed who had
distinguished themselves in any way by
their literary acquirements and productions,
inviting their co-operation. We have now
before us a list of the contributors amounting
to ninety names, and out of these ninety,
there are certainly not more than nine
churchmen.</p>

<p>The English public has of late years become
partially acquainted with a remarkable
institution existing in Wales, which has
come down from very ancient times, called
Yr Eisteddfod, or the Session, meaning in
its primitive signification the Session of the
Bards. Its object is to encourage the
cultivation of literature, poetry and music.
The English press has tried to throw great
ridicule on this institution, as the English
press is wont to do, upon all institutions
that are not English. And yet surely, as
the Bishop of St. David's has said, 'it is a
most remarkable feature in the history of
any people, and such as could be said of no
other than the Welsh, that they have centred
their national recreation in literature and
musical competitions.' Prizes ranging from
&pound;1 to &pound;100 are offered for the best compositions
in poetry, prose, and music. The
highest honour bestowed by the Eisteddfod
is the Bardic chair, and the productions
entitling the successful candidates to this
distinction are supposed to possess rare
merit. There are now living nine chaired
bards, of whom one is a clergyman, seven
are Nonconformist ministers, and one a Nonconformist
layman. In musical compositions,
the proportion would be about the same.
And certainly the Welsh clergy of the present
day have not, any more than their predecessors,
distinguished themselves as authors.
A catalogue of Welsh books published
within the last twenty years, would show a
very beggarly 'account' standing to the credit
of the official instructors of the Welsh
people.</p>

<p>Such are the past history and the present
condition of the Established Church in
Wales. Surely no legislature with any sense
of justice can long refuse to deal with so
anomalous an institution as that we have
described; a Church which has wholly
failed, and is still failing, to accomplish the
only object for which it pretends to exist,
from which&mdash;and that entirely owing to its
own criminal neglect&mdash;the great body of the
people are hopelessly alienated, and which
has no vital relation with the religions, political,
social, or literary life of the nation.
And it is not merely a theoretical anomaly.
It is an intolerable practical grievance, and is
becoming more and more so every day. For
its friends, numbering as they do nearly all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
landowners and wealthy classes, galvanized, of
late years, into a sort of spasmodic zeal, which
is far more political than religious, are making
frantic efforts to regain for their Church the
ascendancy it has so righteously lost, by a
very unscrupulous use of their wealth, their
social position, and their control over the
land. The advocates of the Church, especially
in the English press, are trying to
wreak their vengeance on a nation of Dissenters,
by traducing the character of the
people, and ridiculing their language, their
literature, and their religious institutions;
and this they are not deterred from doing
by their utter ignorance of all three. Some
of the Welsh clergy, also, exasperated by
seeing their pretensions contemned, and their
ministrations forsaken, are propagating the
most monstrous calumnies against their
successful rivals, the Dissenting ministers.
One Conservative journal in London has especially
distinguished itself by throwing its
columns open to these anonymous slanderers.
Here are some of the flowers of speech that
have been plentifully scattered in its pages
on the Welsh Nonconformists. 'The Welsh
language is made the instrument of evil by
preachers and other supporters of anarchy
and plunder.' 'The people are actively
taught to commit arson and murder; they
are regularly drilled into Fenianism.' 'Dissenting
ministers are the curse of Wales;
there is scarcely a sermon or lecture they
deliver that is not full of sedition.'</p>

<p>And yet the country whose population is
thus systematically trained to sedition and
murder, is more free from serious crime than
any part of the United Kingdom; so free,
indeed, that in many of the counties the
annual visit of her Majesty's judges is almost
a work of supererogation. Take as an
example the county of Cardigan, which was
the scene of the most extensive and cruel
political persecutions after the last election,
where about sixty tenants were evicted from
their holdings, some of them under circumstances
of a singularly exasperating character.
And yet at the Assizes, that were held
immediately after, there was not a single
prisoner to be tried. Mr. Justice Hannen,
in charging the grand jury, said 'that a
perfectly clear calendar was a circumstance
he had never before met with since he had
been on the bench, and he understood from
his brother judges that only in the Principality
of Wales was such a thing known, and
that there it was frequent. Whether it was
attributable to race or to the influence of
religious teaching he could not say, but he
felt deeply interested in the matter, and
whatever might be the cause, there was the
indisputable fact, one of which the county of
Cardigan might well be proud.'</p>

<p>These insane efforts to drive or to drag the
people back into the Church by coercion and
calumny, produce, of course, precisely the
opposite effect. Indeed the Conservatives,
in their treatment of Wales, are triumphantly
vindicating their right to the title bestowed
upon them by Mr. Stuart Mill, as 'the stupid
party.' Unhappily, however, they do succeed
in embittering the heart of the people,
and in introducing alienation and anger into
their relations with the classes who are thus
tempted to tamper with their religious and
political rights. And all this is owing to
the existence of an Established Church.</p>

<p>It is difficult to estimate our unpaid obligations
to the students and scholars who have
sacrificed their life to furnish us with the
common-places of our knowledge. The
elaborate and prolonged effort, the perseverance,
ingenuity, and scientific skill often
concealed in the foundations of a great
building or in the underways of a great
city, are no inapt illustration of the lifelong
labours of those students and votaries of
literature who have placed in our hands
authentic and accurate copies of the <i>chefs-d'&oelig;uvre</i>
of ancient thinkers. The learned,
patient, and devout men to whom we are
indebted for our present careful approximations
to the text of the New Testament, have
undergone a species of toil which it is very
difficult for those scholars even to appreciate,
who have never made the attempt to decipher
a single MS. or to gather around them the
abundant and often conflicting evidence on
which the judgment of the critic really turns.
Whatever be the ultimate currency or acceptance
of the text which Dr. Tregelles has
offered to the world as the result of his life-long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
effort, and granting that some of the
disadvantages under which he has suffered
have left ineffaceable marks on the greater
part of the work, and that his main principles
may still be under judicature, yet we readily
endorse the strong language of Bishop
Ellicott: 'The edition of Tregelles will last
to the very end of time as a noble monument
of faithful, enduring, and accurate labour in
the cause of truth; it will always be referred
to as an uniquely trustworthy collection of
assorted critical materials of the greatest
value, and as such it will probably never be
superseded.'<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> The Bishop does not regard
Dr. Tregelles' text as the final one, but does
not hesitate to speak of it as far better than
Tischendorf's, and as furnishing material
which no subsequent editor can afford to
ignore. With the exception of the text of the
Apocalypse and of the appendices rendered
necessary by the progress of textual criticism
since the earlier portions of the work were
published, this long-expected work is now
placed in our hands. The exception to which
we have referred is, we profoundly regret to
say, occasioned by the serious indisposition
of the learned, laborious, and devout editor.
The regret is to some extent alleviated from
a literary point of view by the circumstance
that one of the first contributions to Biblical
science made by this conscientious and
accurate scholar was published in 1844, and
entitled 'The Book of Revelation in Greek,
edited from Ancient Authorities, with a new
English Version and various Readings, by
Samuel P. Tregelles.' There is this difference,
however, between the evidence alleged
by Dr. Tregelles for the text of the Revelation
and that which he has pursued throughout
the elaborate work now before us, that in the
former he was either content or only able at
that time to give the evidence of the few
Uncial MSS. and early versions, then known
to contain the Apocalypse, with such confirmation
as they received from a large number
of the Cursive MSS. Although his
object was to approximate as nearly as
possible to the most ancient text, his <i>apparatus
criticus</i> had not then reached the
proportions it has subsequently assumed,
and he did not even attempt to marshal the
evidence of patristic quotations, or to give
the arguments <i>pro</i> and <i>contra</i> any reading
that he deliberately adopted. The <i>Codex
Sinaiticus</i> had not then been rescued from
the Convent of St. Catherine by the enterprising
Dr. Tischendorf, and the system of
careful notation which is adopted in the
<i>magnum opus</i> now before us, had not been
elaborated. Since 1844, moreover, the Rev.
Bradley Alford has published a collation of
the celebrated Cursive MS. 38, Dr. Delitzch
has discovered the MS. used by Erasmus,
and a careful collation is promised of the
Codex Basiliensis, which Dr. Tregelles proposes
to call Q, instead of adopting the old
and confusing symbol B, which has led some
to identify it with <i>the</i> Codex Vaticanus.
The introduction to the interesting volume
on the text of the Book of Revelation was
expanded in 1854 into a goodly octavo
entitled 'An Account of the printed text of
the Greek New Testament, with remarks on
its revision upon critical principles, together
with a collation of the critical texts of
Griesbach, Scholz, Lachmann, and Tischendorf
with that in common use.' We know
no work on biblical criticism more charged
with well-digested information, and none
which reveals a more extensive literary enterprise,
than that which is here recorded. Dr.
Tregelles tells us in the preface to his Greek
Testament, that this work contains a detailed
exposition of the principles he holds and the
studies in which he has been engaged, and
as his editors earnestly request that it be
referred to in explanation of the principle
adopted by Dr. Tregelles, it is almost incumbent
upon us to remind our readers of
its contents and spirit. In the appendix to
section 13, occurs a brief and modest sketch
of the extensive and continuous labours of
this great student of the New Testament
text. It appears that he commenced his
research simply for his own satisfaction.
The text of Dr. Scholz, based so largely on
the consensus of later MSS. but revealing
the small group of Alexandrian authorities
and most ancient witnesses in opposition to
the text adopted by him, first called Dr.
Tregelles to a consideration of the fact that
these most ancient but rejected testimonies
were curiously confirmed by the older
versions. He was thus led to conceive of
the creation of a text entirely based on the
authority of the most ancient copies. He
did not even know that Lachmann in 1838
had already made his celebrated though
imperfect attempt to produce the text of the
first four centuries in entire or professed
independence of the later authorities and of
the received text. When the Codex Amiatinus
of Jerome's Latin Version was collated
and published by Fleck in 1840, Tregelles
found it confirm, in opposition to the Clementine
Vulgate, the oldest Greek readings. In
preparing his work on the text of the
Revelation, he found it necessary to collate
the Uncial MSS. with his own hand. In
1845 he collated the Codex Augiensis (in
Trinity Coll. Camb.). Though he visited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
Rome for the purpose of collating the celebrated
<i>Codex Vaticanus</i> he was prevented from
copying unless it were surreptitiously on his
thumb-nails, a single reading. We formerly
gave to our readers<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> a full account of the
various imperfect collations made by Birch,
Bartolocci, and Cardinal Mai, and also of the
edition which has recently been published
under the auspices of Dr. Tischendorf. In
the greater part of Dr. Tregelles' critical
labours he has been compelled to trust to
the faulty and otherwise divergent collations
which preceded Dr. Tischendorf's edition; but
while he was deprived of the personal advantage
of investigating Codex B for himself,
he did collate at Rome, with his own hand,
the Codex Passonei, and at Florence the
Codex Amiatinus of Jerome's Latin; and at
Modena, Venice, Munich, and Basle, other
Uncial MSS. of considerable portions of the
New Testament. Many of these were used
by Tischendorf in his second Leipsic edition
of the Greek Testament.</p>

<p>Dr. Tregelles became acquainted in 1849
with the remarkable Syriac fragment which
Dr. Cureton found among the MSS. brought
from the Nitrian monasteries and deposited
in the British Museum. This mutilated
fragment contains portions of the four
Gospels&mdash;Matt. i.-viii. 22; x. 31-xxiii.
25; Mark xvi. 17-20; John i. 1-42; iii.
6-vii. 37; xiv. 11-29; Luke ii. 48-iii.
16; vii. 33-xv. 21; xvii. 24-xxiv. 44; but
in the opinion of the best Syriac scholars, it
is older than the Peshito, and would seem
to have been collated with the Greek by the
translator of the Greek Testament into
Syriac (Peshito). Dr. Cureton supposed
that it represents a first translation from the
original Hebrew Gospel of Matthew, but Dr.
Davidson has we think conclusively proved
that it is a translation from the Greek. Dr.
Cureton conjectured that sundry curious
blunders or deviations from the canonical
Matthew are due to the mistakes made by
the translator of the Hebrew into Syriac.
These conjectures are ingenious but perfectly
gratuitous. Dr. Davidson has shown
that in a variety of places the Curetonian
Syriac (as it is called) differs from the early
Greek text by the obvious blunder between
two <i>Greek</i> words of similar appearance.
We have been rather explicit on the matter
of this valuable witness to a very early text,
not only because Dr. Tregelles and others
have made constant reference to it, but
because the second work which we have
placed at the head of this article is a translation
into Greek of the first part of these
precious fragments, and is, moreover, a collation
of every reading with Scholz's text,
and with Schaaf's edition of the Peshito.
This critical effort of Mr. Crowfoot will be
of real service to the student who is not
familiar with Syriac, and who wishes to see
for himself the singular deviations of this
text from the Textus Receptus. Take <i>e.g.</i>
the additions made to the text of Matthew
in chap. xx. 28, where a passage resembling
one in Luke vii. is introduced. The Cur.
Syriac here is sustained by the Codex D.
Very frequently, however, it corresponds in
its omissions with the most ancient MSS.
and with the old Latin, as in Matt. xx. 22,
23. It is profoundly interesting, moreover,
in that it retains of Mark's Gospel only a
portion of the very closing passage, which is
not to be found in Codex B. or in &alefsym;. Partly
in consequence of this testimony Dr. Tregelles
leaves the passage as an authentic appendix
to the text of the Gospel of St. Mark.
We see that Mr. Crowfoot and Dr. Tregelles
sometimes differ, as we might expect
them to do, as to the Greek equivalent which
they suppose most likely to have been the
exemplar of the Syriac, but they do not
seriously differ as to the testimony it bears
to a particular reading. In Matthew xi. 23,
the Textus Rec. reads
<span class="greek" title="kai sy Kapernaoum h&ecirc; he&ocirc;s tou ouranou hyps&ocirc;theisa, k.t.l.">
&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#963;&#8058; &#922;&#945;&#960;&#949;&#961;&#957;&#945;&#959;&#8058;&#956; &#7969; &#7957;&#969;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#959;&#8016;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#8166; &#8017;&#968;&#969;&#952;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#945;, &#954;.&#964;.&#955;</span>.
Mr.
Crowfoot gives in place of <span class="greek" title="h&ecirc;">&#7969;</span>, <span class="greek" title="ouch">&#959;&#8016;&#967;</span>. Dr.
Tregelles on the authority of B, C, D, the
Vulgate <i>a, b, c</i>, and Syr. Cur., gives <span class="greek" title="m&ecirc;">&#956;&#8052;</span>, and
makes the clause interrogative.</p>

<p>But to proceed with Dr. Tregelles' labours.
The various collations made by him need not
be exhaustively enumerated, though special
attention should be called to the extraordinary
effort and patience which was required by
him to form an accurate estimate of the
readings of the Codex Colbertinus, called 33
in the Gospels, and 13 in the Acts and
Catholic Epistles. The leaves of the vellum
have been in places sodden with damp and
stuck together. The consequence was that
when separated, 'the ink adhered to the
<i>opposite</i> page rather than to its own, so that
in many leaves the MS. could only be read
by observing how the ink had <i>set-off</i>, and
thus reading the Greek words <i>backwards</i>.'
At Paris, Leipsic, Berlin, Dresden and Wolfenb&uuml;ttel,
Dr. Tregelles continued his patient
research, and came to such discoveries
as that the Codex Sangallensis (<span class="greek" title="Delta">&#916;</span> of the
Gospels), and Codex Boernerianus (G of St.
Paul's Epistles) were the severed portions of
the same book. At Dublin, the difficult
palimpsest fragment (Z) was deciphered after
submitting the vellum to a chemical process,
and Tregelles was able to restore the
portions which had been left blank in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
edition of this fragment published by Dr.
Barrett.</p>

<p>Special reference may be made to the
Codex, called Zacynthius and designated &#926;,
the property of the British and Foreign
Bible Society. This is almost an illegible
parchment palimpsest, containing considerable
portions of Luke's Gospel. The readings
of this old lectionary have been carefully
noted by Tregelles and are cited throughout
his text of the Gospel of Luke. The
Codex Leicestrensis, the property of the
Town Council of Leicester, has been also
carefully collated by our author, as well as
by Mr. Scrivener. It is cited as 69 in the
Gospels, 31 Acts, and by other numbers in
remaining portions of the New Testament.</p>

<p>Dr. Tregelles has not paid <i>much</i> attention to
the mass of cursive MSS. It is not fair to
accuse him of utterly neglecting them, when
he has gone through the laborious work of
collating specimens of cursive MSS. in each
of the divisions of his subject. He has,
however, placed far more confidence in another
class of authority and of evidence. The
most ancient versions have been thoroughly
noted by him in their several codices. The
old Latin is carefully studied throughout;
the Codex Amiatinus of Jerome's Latin is
published in the volume before us, with all
the deviations from it in the Clementine
Vulgate. The Peshito and Harcleian Syriac
versions, the Cureton fragments, the Jerusalem
Lectionary, the Memphitic and Thebaic
(sometimes called the Coptic and Sahidic)
versions, the Ethiopic and the Gothic,
are used throughout this edition of the Greek
Testament. A considerable number of uncial
MSS., which have been published in facsimile
or in a printed text, Dr. Tregelles has
copied with his own hand, and all the rest
of the uncial MSS. he appears to have also
collated with his own hand. Having gone
through this extraordinary labour, he has
proceeded to give the text of the New Testament
on the authority of the oldest MSS.
and versions, and with the aid of the earliest
citations, so as to present the text of the
fourth century. He does not hesitate to deviate
from these ancient testimonies, when
they agree in transcriptural error; and he
confers this great advantage on the student,
that he states in every case the authorities on
both sides with reference to any disputed
reading.</p>

<p>Now there has often been expressed on
the part of the advocates of the cursive MSS.
and the Constantinopolitan group of MSS.
and of the later uncial MSS., the conviction
that their consensus ought to outweigh the
strong and clearly expressed testimony of the
ancient MSS. on the plausible supposition that
the existing later MS. <i>may</i> be the copies of
an older text than that of any existing MS.
whatever. Now if Dr. Tregelles or Dean
Alford or Dr. Tischendorf had been mere
slaves of the few uncial MSS. of great antiquity
which are extant, and had no further
or corroborative testimony to add in favour
of the readings, or the additions and omissions
they have affirmed, there would be
much justice in the protest sometimes raised;
but neither of them can justly be charged
with this, and Dr. Tregelles must certainly
be acquitted of such prejudice. He and
Dean Alford do indisputably and notoriously
differ in certain cases where subjective
reasons and considerations of the exercise of
personal discretion must assume great importance;
and in some of these doubtful
and difficult cases Tregelles has been more
influenced by diplomatic considerations, and
has more readily yielded to authority, than
Dean Alford; but Dr. Tregelles has stated
very acutely and powerfully his reasons for
trusting the ancient MSS., even in these difficult
readings. Let the following phenomena
to which he is able, in most cases, to
add the unexceptionable evidence of his
own personal observation and collation, be
considered. (<i>a</i>) The uncial MSS. are now
known and have been at length collated
with such care that we may be certain of
their testimony. (<i>b</i>) The palimpsests which
have been recently found and deciphered
confirm the readings of the oldest codices.
(<i>c</i>) The great discovery of the Sinaitic Codex
throws in its testimony against the bulk of
the cursive MSS. (<i>d</i>) The Curetonian Syriac
of the Gospels agrees with the oldest
MSS. (<i>e</i>) Certain cursive MSS. (such as
Codex Colbertinus of the 12th century)
agree with the ancient text rather than with
the bulk of the cursives, thus providing a
class of exception which proves the rule.
(<i>f</i>) There is agreement of the ancient versions
with this older text; and (<i>g</i>) not infrequently
there is the express testimony of
early patristic writers to the existence of
such a text in their day. Now the principle
that Dr. Tregelles takes great pains to establish
is as follows,&mdash;While there are certain
readings sustained by the great majority of
recent MSS., divergent readings of the same
passages can be proved to have been in existence
long before the existence of these
MSS., by the evidence of the earliest MSS.
of the old Latin version, by the Syriac and
other translations, and by the deliberate discussion
of the very peculiarities in question
by some earlier writer like Origen. Now,
even if there were no uncial MSS. which
confirmed such divergence, this would constitute
a presumption in favour of such a divergence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
if some adequate explanation could
be found of the commonly received text. But,
if in addition to these testimonies, a considerable
number of the most ancient uncial
MSS. confirm such readings, then Tregelles
urges the adoption of them as an approximation
to the true text. Thus, take his elaborate
argument in favour of the reading of
Matt. xix. 17, <span class="greek" title="ti me er&ocirc;tas peri tou agathou? heis estin ho agathos">
&#964;&#943; &#956;&#949; &#7952;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#8119;&#962; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#959;&#8166;; &#949;&#7991;&#962;
&#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#8001; &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#972;&#962;</span>.
This alteration was first
made by Griesbach and sustained by Lachmann,
and adopted subsequently by Tischendorf
and Alford, though condemned by
Mr. Scrivener on the ground of the numerical
poverty of the evidence, and because it
evinced theological zeal for the honour of the
Incarnate Son. It is interesting to find,
since the judgment of these recensionists was
deliberately given, that the final recension of
the Vatican MS. and the testimony of the
Sinaitic MS. have arisen to defend it. The
evidence for the existence of this text in the
fourth century, or indeed before the time of
Origen, and before the existence of <i>Cureton
Syriac</i>, just proves, according to Tregelles,
that it is safe 'to take the <i>few</i> documents
whose evidence is <i>proved</i> to be trustworthy,
and to discard the eighty-nine ninetieths of
the evidence shown thus to be less valuable.'
One result of his comparative criticism is,
'that as certain MSS. are found by a process
of inductive proof to contain an ancient text,
their character as witnesses must be considered
to be so established, that in other
places their testimony deserves peculiar
weight;' and still further&mdash;'that the ancient
MSS. were not exceptional documents, because
they contain readings which we learn
elsewhere to have been both ancient and
widespread.'</p>

<p>One great advantage in Dr. Tregelles' New
Testament is, that he not merely states but
cites the authority of the patristic writers to
whom he appeals, and by a somewhat elaborate
notation enables the reader at a
glance to see how his uncial MSS. and principal
versions are serving him, and where all
the <i>lacun&aelig;</i> begin and end.</p>

<p>We proceed to give some further account
of the contents and peculiarities of this
great work. Dr. Tregelles and Dr. Alford
agree in the great majority of cases where
they differ from the received text, although
in some instances they have not with the
same facts before them, come to the same
conclusion. <i>E.g.</i>, both call attention to the
fact that in John vi. 51, the clause <span class="greek" title="h&ecirc;n eg&ocirc;
d&ocirc;s&ocirc;">&#7971;&#957; &#7952;&#947;&#8060; &#948;&#974;&#963;&#969;</span>
is omitted by B, C, D, L, T, 33, the
Latin versions, the Cur. Syriac, Thebaic, and
&AElig;thiopic versions, and by many Fathers,
and Alford even mentions a longer list of
such omissions than Tregelles, but Alford
allows the <i>homoioteleuton</i> just above, to be a
sufficient explanation of the original omission
in the text, and retains the clause: Tregelles
strikes it out, making the verse read thus,
'and the bread which I will give for the life
of the world is my flesh.' Since their discussion,
the Sinaitic MS. confirms Tregelles,
by not only omitting the clause, but altering
the order of the words. This alteration
of order may confirm Dean Alford in his
continued insertion of the clause, though we
think Tregelles is in the right. Through
whole chapters of the Gospels, Acts, and
Epistles, these two recensionists may be said
to agree <i>verbatim et literatim</i>, and to have
come precisely to the same conclusions:
still a few specimens of their divergence may
explain more fully than a more elaborate
analysis, the character of their work. In
John viii. 41, Alford prefers the less comprehensible
form <span class="greek" title="gegenn&ecirc;metha">&#947;&#949;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#942;&#956;&#949;&#952;&#945;</span>, to the form
<span class="greek" title="egenn&ecirc;th&ecirc;men">&#7952;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#942;&#952;&#951;&#956;&#949;&#957;</span>, on the ground of the possible
alteration of the tense to the more usual
form. We do not think that Tregelles has
acted here on his own principles, for he
shows that versions and citations defend the
former rather than the latter reading. In
John viii. 54, they differ again as to the preferable
character of the readings <span class="greek" title="h&ecirc;m&ocirc;n">&#7969;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</span> or
<span class="greek" title="hum&ocirc;n">&#8017;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</span>, 'our God' or 'your God,' and here
Tregelles defends the reading <span class="greek" title="h&ecirc;m&ocirc;n">&#7969;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</span> with a
great array of evidence; see also ch. ix. 4,
where <span class="greek" title="h&ecirc;mas dei ergazesthai k.t.l.">&#7969;&#956;&#8118;&#962; &#948;&#949;&#8150; &#7952;&#961;&#947;&#940;&#950;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; &#954;.&#964;.&#955;.</span> is given as
preferable to the <span class="greek" title="eme dei k.t.l.">&#7952;&#956;&#8050; &#948;&#949;&#8150; &#954;.&#964;.&#955;.</span>, and largely
on the ground that Origen must have been
acquainted with this obscure text, and tried
to interpret it. In each instance a theological
zeal might have provoked a copyist to
the ordinary readings. Throughout the
ninth chapter of the Acts, where the received
text has passed through so fiery an
alembic, Alford and Tregelles agree, we believe,
in every word, with one exception, and
that is the word <span class="greek" title="epeirazen">&#7952;&#960;&#949;&#943;&#961;&#945;&#950;&#949;&#957;</span> is preferred by
one to the <span class="greek" title="epeirato">&#7952;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#8118;&#964;&#959;</span> of the other in v. 26.
Here strong uncial authority governs Tregelles,
and the disposition to prefer the less usual or
less common form has influenced Dr. Alford.
In Romans v. 1, the celebrated reading
<span class="greek" title="ech&ocirc;men">&#7956;&#967;&#969;&#956;&#949;&#957;</span> in place of <span class="greek" title="echomen">&#7956;&#967;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;</span> is preferred by
Tregelles. Alford still has doubts about it,
from the indecision of MSS. in their modes
of spelling certain vowel sounds. The quotations
from Origen and Tertullian are decisive
of the existence of such a text in their
day, and the array of versions is strongly
confirmatory of the seven uncials and two
cursives that are quoted for it. We need
scarcely say, that Tregelles gives his powerful
authority in favour of <span class="greek" title="hos">&#8003;&#962;</span>, rather than
<span class="greek" title="theos">&#952;&#949;&#8056;&#962;</span>, in 1 Tim. iii. 16, and rejects the reference
to the three heavenly witnesses in 1
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
John v. 7; but in spite of the authority of
Tischendorf's collation of B and of &alefsym;, and
other authorities in favour of the received
text, he gives <span class="greek" title="kyriou">&#954;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#965;</span> instead of <span class="greek" title="theou">&#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</span> as the
preferable reading of Acts xx. 28.</p>

<p>Our author is strongly moved by the citations
of Origen, and consequently places in
his margin as the alternative reading in Heb.
ii. 9, <span class="greek" title="ch&ocirc;ris theou">&#967;&#969;&#961;&#8054;&#962; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</span>
by the side of <span class="greek" title="chariti theou">&#967;&#940;&#961;&#953;&#964;&#953; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</span>.
It is clear, from no fewer than seven citations
of Origen, he must have had a MS. before
him with this startling statement, 'that
Jesus on the behalf of all without (or in the
absence, or hiding of) God might taste
death.' The only MS. authority for such a
reading is the uncial fragment called M of
the tenth century, so that we are surprised
to see the high place given to it in Tregelles'
margin. Dr. Tregelles, in the wealth of material
at his disposal, sometimes almost
travels into the region of the exegete, as in
the long note upon Rom. ix. 5, where he
gives eight or nine quotations from Greek
and Latin Fathers, to show the sense in
which they took the phrase, <span class="greek" title="ho &ocirc;n epi pant&ocirc;n theos eulog&ecirc;tos eis tous ai&ocirc;nas">
&#8001; &#8034;&#957; &#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#952;&#949;&#8056;&#962; &#949;&#8016;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#951;&#964;&#8056;&#962;  &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#945;&#7984;&#8182;&#957;&#945;&#962;</span>
as not divided
from the <span class="greek" title="ho christos">&#8001; &#967;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8056;&#962;</span> which precedes.
It may be added, that he retains <span class="greek" title="en Ephes&ocirc;">&#7952;&#957; &#7960;&#966;&#941;&#963;&#8179;
</span>
in the text of Eph. i. 1, thus preserving the
traditional character of this Epistle as one
addressed not to Laodiceans or any group of
Asiatic churches, but to the church at
Ephesus.</p>

<p>Dr. Tregelles and Dean Alford differ
slightly in 1 Cor. iii. In the fifth verse,
<span class="greek" title="ti oun estin Apoll&ocirc;s">&#964;&#943; &#959;&#8022;&#957; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#913;&#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#974;&#962;
</span> is preferred to the
<span class="greek" title="tis">&#964;&#943;&#962;</span> of the Receptus, by Tregelles, while Alford
sustains the latter. Tregelles has given
the adjectives <span class="greek" title="chrysion">&#967;&#961;&#965;&#963;&#943;&#959;&#957;
</span> and <span class="greek" title="argyrion">&#7936;&#961;&#947;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;
</span> in v. 12,
in place of the <span class="greek" title="chryson">&#967;&#961;&#965;&#963;&#8056;&#957;</span>,
<span class="greek" title="argyron">&#7940;&#961;&#947;&#965;&#961;&#959;&#957;</span>; and <span class="greek" title="eth&ecirc;ka">&#7956;&#952;&#951;&#954;&#945;</span>
to the commoner <span class="greek" title="tetheika">&#964;&#941;&#952;&#949;&#953;&#954;&#945;</span> and of v. 10.
Here Alford seems to have the weight of
evidence in favour of his view, though doubtless
the <i>aorist</i> gives the finer sense, and
makes the truer affirmation 'I laid,' rather
than 'I have been laying the foundation.'</p>

<p>He leaves <span class="greek" title="Agar">&#7948;&#947;&#945;&#961;</span> in brackets in his text of
Gal. iv. 25. So also he deals with the <span class="greek" title="eik&ecirc;">&#949;&#7984;&#954;&#8134;</span>
of Matt. v. 22. The <span class="greek" title="baptisantes">&#946;&#945;&#960;&#964;&#943;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;
</span> of Matt.
xxviii. 19, given on the authority of the
doubtful recensions of the Vatican MS. is
most unsatisfactory. Tischendorf, who gave
it in some of his earlier editions, has returned
to <span class="greek" title="baptizontes">&#946;&#945;&#960;&#964;&#943;&#950;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;
</span>; and probably Dr.
Tregelles will show us in his appendix that
he has done the same, as &alefsym; agrees with all
the uncial MS. here in the more grammatical
reading. We will not further trouble our
readers with details. These will suffice for
a specimen. Every page presents at a glance
the presence of the entire group of MS. versions
and fragments collated by the author,
and the whole is printed with extreme beauty
of type and arrangement.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we express our profound
sense of the obligation under which the accomplished
and persevering editor has laid
every student of the New Testament. There
is a fulness and richness of material placed
here by him, at the disposal of those who
are utterly precluded from this kind of investigation.
The work is done so conscientiously
and laboriously, that great confidence
is inspired in the accuracy and reliableness
of the information thus harvested for general
use. The principles on which Dr. Tregelles
has toiled, are so clearly put, and for the
most part so patiently applied, that they
command hearty respect, if not general assent.
Such work as this is necessarily provisional,
and cannot be regarded as final.
The discovery of the Sinaitic codex and the
recent collated edition of the Vatican MS.
since the commencement of Tregelles' enterprise,
is sufficient proof of this; and until
the promised appendices appear we cannot
tell to what extent this circumstance may
have modified the text of our author. It is
inexpressibly affecting that the labour of nearly
forty years should be arrested when the patient,
true-hearted scholar had just reached,
as we understand, the last chapter of the
Revelation, and that he should be suffering
not only from prostration of strength, but
be smitten in that very organ of vision
which he had consecrated so lovingly to his
Master's service. We can only deplore and
sympathize with such disappointments as
these. We are satisfied that we speak the
universal desire of his collaborateurs, and of
his rivals, in this lofty field of work, when
we express the earnest hope that he may yet
be spared to complete his labours, and to see
the effect of them in the deeper reverence
paid by his contemporaries to the Word of
the living God.</p>

<p class="p2">It is impossible as yet even to guess the
consequences of the memorable war of
1870. It may verify the German exclamation
that the hour of the Latin race has
come, and that France has ceased to be a

of that essentially noble people,
and even to the recovery of its military supremacy.
It may develope a French Republic

period when France, purified by adversity,
shall win the esteem and admiration of Europe,
by her constancy in affliction, her lofty
patriotism, her renewed energy, her surviving
genius. Looking at it, too, from the
other side, it may accelerate the unity of
Germany, cemented by blood poured out in
the field, by a brotherhood in arms, and by
common triumphs; or it may tend only to
German divisions, and to the collapse of the
policy of 1866, by aggrandising Prussia out
of all proportions, and making her influence
intolerable to the minor States.
Who, indeed, shall speculate on the results
of this mighty and awful conflict, when,
though it seems for the time to be drawing
to a close, France refuses to acknowledge
defeat, and defies the invader behind the
walls of the capital, and when, though apparently
struck to the ground, she still raises
the flag of resistance, appeals to the memories
of 1793, and endeavours to rally for a
final effort those national forces which, in
her case, have so often proved impossible to
subdue? Yet, if we shall not attempt to
forecast the remote issues of this tremendous
struggle, or to predict what it shall ultimately
bring forth, the time has come when we can
briefly describe its marvellous events and
fortunes, and can truly indicate its immediate
lessons of deep significance to these
kingdoms. The momentous war of 1870 is
not only one of the grandest illustrations of
the art which founds and destroys Empires;
it not only is an astonishing drama, every
scene which the military student should examine
carefully and lay to heart; it not only
fascinates the ordinary observer by its gigantic
action and immense events; it points
conclusively to a solemn moral, not to be forgotten
by any country which seeks to maintain
its position in the world, and cherishes
a sense of its independence. It shows how
weak, in the hour of trial, may be even a
great military power which neglects the real
sources of its strength, and relies mainly on
its martial traditions, on its past honour, on
the memory of a name; it proves fearfully
how imperial despotism may rear an edifice
of imposing grandeur, which for a generation
shall deceive mankind, and yet fall suddenly
at the first breath of misfortune; it
testifies to the old truth that material prosperity
with moral corruption are the fruitful
sources of national decline; and it teaches
us what we should never forget, how terrible
and decisive, in modern warfare, are the
results of rapid and great success, and how
absolutely necessary it is for England, in the
present menacing condition of Europe, to
surround herself with an invulnerable shield,
to look after her national defences, and to
take care that by sea and on land she shall
possess the means of repelling aggression.</p>

<p>It would be an unnecessary and unprofitable
task to examine at length the causes of
the war. Impartial history, we believe, will
pronounce that though Napoleon gave the
challenge, it had been to some degree provoked
by the policy of Bismark, by the attitude
recently taken by Prussia, by the series
of events which since 1866 have changed the
centre of power in Germany. It was impossible
but that the Emperor should feel bitterly
how he had been outwitted by the unscrupulous
statesman who had purchased his
complicity in the spoliation of Denmark by
promises of annexation on the Rhine, and
had afterwards coolly violated his pledges;
nor yet that he should not be really alarmed
at the immense development of the military
power of Prussia during the preceding five
years. It would have been disregarding the
traditions which, rightly or wrongly, for two
centuries have guided the foreign policy of
France, to have witnessed the absorption
of the German States into one dominant and
threatening power, without an effort to break
the union; and if an attempt to obtain this,
was contrary to modern ideas and aspirations,
it was only carrying out what had always
been the views of Henry IV. and
Richelieu. Besides, ever since the battle of
Sadowa, France and Prussia had been watching
each other, and tending inevitably to
collision; both Powers had been increasing
their armaments, and events have proved
which was the more ready; and we know
from the Imperial correspondence that Napoleon
had been repeatedly warned that
Prussia was meditating an invasion of France,
and would avail herself of the first opportunity.
It is not, therefore, too much to say
that it was not merely French folly and arrogance
which precipitated this tremendous
conflict; the conduct of Prussia and her aggressive
acts contributed to it in no slight
degree; and if France, as it has turned out,
was unwise in not accepting accomplished
facts, and in chafing at the military strength
of her rival, we can perfectly comprehend
this sentiment, without charging her, as a
nation, with any peculiar turn for aggrandisement,
or even any extraordinary ambition.
It must be admitted that the Emperor
was utterly in the wrong in the pretext
on which he declared war, and that his
whole policy in this respect showed ignorance
of the real state of opinion. After the
Hohenzollern candidature of Spain had been
withdrawn at the instance of England, it
was an act of extreme unwisdom to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
proceeded to further demands; and the result
was that, to outward seeming, France, at
the beginning of hostilities, was alone to
blame for the frightful contest, and that
Prussia appeared the injured defender of the
national independence of Germany. In
truth, however, in this as in other matters,
Bismark probably outgeneralled Napoleon;
he seems to have been eager for war, and
to have been too glad to find an opportunity
to attack France with the support of public
opinion; and now at least when he puts forward
claims to wrest from her some of her
present provinces, he can scarcely be considered
by impartial men as the mere opponent
of French aggression.</p>

<p>Hostilities were proclaimed on the 15th of
July, after efforts at negotiation on the part
of England. There can be little doubt that
the war was welcomed by the classes who
form public opinion in Germany, quite as
much as in France. The passionate and
foolish cry, 'to Berlin,' was answered by
shouts of defiance, 'to Paris;' and if French
chauvins and journalists talked of the annexation
of the left bank of the Rhine, and of
the breaking up of the German Confederation,
claims for 'the lost patrimony of Elsass
and Lothringen' were put forward prominently
by the press of Germany. In fact,
amiable German professors who back the
arrogant demands of Bismark, and pleasantly
insist on 'the line of the Vosges,' as a
necessary bulwark for 'peace-loving Germany,'
against the 'intolerable ambition of
Frenchmen,' must have a strange notion of
the facts of the case; the war fever was at
least as strong in the capital of Prussia, as
in that of France; and it is about as correct
to represent the two nations as differing in
this, as it is to repeat the veracious legend&mdash;of
which of course the League of Pilnitz
and the barbarous invasion of 1792 are confirmations
that cannot be gainsaid&mdash;that
France has always been the assailant of her
meek and long-suffering Teutonic rival.
Within a few days after the declaration of
war, the army of the Rhine was set in motion,
and the heads of the columns of eight
French corps were approaching the verge of
the German frontier; the main bodies, however,
being still distant. The first corps,
under the renowned MacMahon, had advanced
from Algeria and the south, and occupied
Upper and Lower Alsace, its headquarters
being at Strasburg. The second and fifth
corps of Frossard and De Failly were sent
forward, and at St. Avold and Bitsche held
the approaches to the Rhenish Palatinate,
from MacMahon's left to near the line of the
Saar. To the left of these again, was the
fourth corps, marched from the north under
L'Admirault, and stationed at and around
Thionville; while, in the rear, Bazaine with
the third corps, was moving to the great
fortress of Metz; the sixth, under the orders
of Canrobert, was on its way from Chalons to
Lorraine; and far behind, the Imperial Guard&mdash;the
flower of the French army&mdash;was pushing
forward from the French capital. In the
meantime, the seventh corps of Douay formed
the extreme right of the great French line;
far to the north it guarded Belfort, the 'gate
of France,' between the Vosges and the Jura;
and it connected itself with MacMahon's rear-guard
along the Rhine and Lower Alsace.
The whole French army, in its first line, extended
in a huge semicircle from Northern
Lorraine to the Southern Vosges; but its
second line, massed between Metz and Chalons,
was at a considerable distance from the
first; and though it was well connected by
railways, and placed as it was, it threatened
equally the Rhenish provinces and Southern
Germany, it was not yet even nearly concentrated.</p>

<p>Such was the disposition of the army of
the Rhine about the 21st or 22nd of July. It
will be seen at once that it was well adapted
for an offensive movement against Germany,
if made rapidly and in full force, for Baden
and the Palatinate were threatened, and the
exact point of attack was concealed. Placed
as they were, the forces of France could
either pour into the Rhineland, drawing after
them their reserves on all sides, or they
could cross the Rhine, and, advancing from
Strasburg, interpose between Northern and
Southern Germany and endeavour to break
up their uniting armies. On the other hand,
the position of the French was badly chosen
as a line of defence; for their foremost corps
were widely disseminated, and in case of a
sudden attack, were thrown too far beyond
their supports; and if they were assailed by
a resolute foe, converging against them in
full strength, they would be exposed to
serious disaster. For these reasons we may
certainly infer that the strategic plan of the
French Emperor was to march upon the
Germans with much rapidity, and whether
the recently published pamphlet does or does
not disclose his purpose, it is evident that he
intended to advance either by the Rhineland
on Landau and Mayence, or by Strasburg
into the territory of Baden. Besides,
he must have known perfectly well that a
brilliant initiative was his best chance; for
not only was it in accordance with the traditions
and genius of the French soldier;
not only was it calculated to sow dissensions
and alarm among his foes and perhaps prevent
them from combining; it was the sole means
to give full effect to the one great advantage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
which France would possess over Prussia
at the beginning of a campaign, the imposing
strength of a standing army, supposed
to be ready at all points and formidable in
its numerical proportions, compared with
levies, immense indeed when brought together
and set in motion, but believed to be
inferior in military power, and requiring
time to be fully arrayed. It may therefore
be said with confidence, that a sudden and
vigorous spring on Germany was the real
scheme of Napoleon III.; and, notwithstanding
all that has occurred, it is impossible
to say what the result would have been
had this design been carried out boldly, with
the promptness and skill of a great commander
who would have led his troops to
immediate victory. Unhappily, however,
for the interests of France, vacillation at the
decisive moment took the place of resolution
and genius; and her armed arrays,
however imposing to outward seeming, were
not in a state to undertake great and rapid
operations. The Emperor lingered a fortnight
at Paris before he went to his headquarters
at Metz; even when he had arrived
he passed nearly a week, uncertain, it would
appear, how to strike; and thus the favourable
opportunity was lost which might have
changed the whole course of the war. In
addition to this, it is now well known that
the army was not ready to march; its commissariat
was not complete; it was deficient
in ammunition and supplies; and its real
strength was considerably less than Napoleon
III. had been led to expect. Between
the irresolution of its chief, and its own ill-prepared
condition, it had already forfeited
its most hopeful chances before even a blow
had been struck.</p>

<p>During these delays of the army of the
Rhine Germany had been making astonishing
efforts. If Bismark's reports are to be
believed, the German nation was not prepared
for immediate war on a gigantic scale.
But considering that since the battle of
Sadowa Prussia had been steadily increasing
her armaments, and that it is tolerably clear
from her government press that she was
eager to measure her strength with France,
we shall scarcely credit the Northern Confederation
with any want of military readiness;
still immense as their exertions were, it is
not impossible that the Southern States were
taken to some extent by surprise.
However this may have been, the summons
to arms against the ancient and dreaded foe
met with but one answer from the Teutonic
race; and whatever may be thought of the
policy of its rulers, its patriotism and heroic
attitude are entitled to the highest admiration.
From the sandy wastes that border
the Niemen to the valleys watered by the
Moselle, and from the shores of the Northern
Sea to the Danube and the Bohemian hills,
the martial cry 'to the war' was heard; the
integrity of the Fatherland was the one
thought of the whole people; and whatever
may have been the divisions caused by the
events of 1866, and whatever the hopes of
dispossessed sovereigns, of blind diplomatists,
or of discontented nobles, it was soon evident
that Napoleon III. would have to
contend against an united Germany. This
single circumstance shows how impolitic
had been the course of the French Emperor,
and how badly he had been advised;
and, in fact, unless, as is not improbable, the
conduct of Prussia shall tend to disunion,
the war will have done more to make Germany
a concordant people than any event
since 1813. Within a few days the military
system of the nation was in full operation;
the army was 'mobilized' and increased to
its war strength within the local limits assigned
to its different divisions, and in an
exceedingly short time a gigantic array
composed of regular troops in the first line,
with reserves of landwehr in the second,
was in a state to commence operations under
the guidance of leaders of proved ability.
Those who witnessed that mighty torrent of
war pouring through Germany towards the
Rhenish frontier have described its tremendous
power and impulse; and none who
have observed how it was directed can doubt
that it had been long held in hand to commence
as well as to repel aggression. Towards
the last days of July and the first of
August, while the French were still disseminated
in Lorraine, three vast German armies
had taken possession of the territory of the
Rhenish Palatinate, and, already in communication
with each other, were being marshalled
to pour into France an overwhelming
tide of invasion. The first army, numbering
about 80,000 men, was under the command
of the aged Steinmetz, and was approaching
the Saar from Treves, its outposts reaching
to near Saar-Louis. The second army, nearly
200,000 strong, had crossed the Rhine at
and above Mayence, and, led by King William
and Prince Frederick Charles, held the
centre of the Rhenish Palatinate, its outposts
almost advanced to the Saar, and its
rearward divisions stretching far backwards.
To the left was the third army, commanded
by the Crown Prince of Prussia, about
150,000 strong; it touched the right of the
second army, and extended thence to the
course of the Rhine, and its vanguard, along
the stream of the Lauter, approached the
northern frontier of Alsace, the main body
being not distant, and concealed behind the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
adjoining fortresses. From Treves on the
west to Landau on the east, and pressing
forward to the very edge of France, the
huge German masses were already in a state
to fall on their enemy with tremendous force.</p>

<p>The manner in which these immense armies
were formed, organised, and moved in
concert within a short distance of the French
frontier, was one of the most notable of
strategic exploits. In the space of nineteen
or twenty days 430,000 men in the highest
state of efficiency for war, with guns, horses,
and other material, had been arrayed and prepared
for the field, and now stood on the verge
of the Rhineland ready to overrun Alsace and
Lorraine. We know of no finer military movement,
except perhaps the splendid concentration
of Napoleon's forces on the Belgian
frontier on the 14th of June, 1815; and it
attests clearly the calculating forethought
and ability of the Prussian Government, the
high training and skill of its generals, and
the discipline and power of the German
troops. The French army, scattered and
divided on the semicircle from Thionville to
Belfort, and with its first line widely separated
from the second, was already in no condition
to offer a successful resistance to its
mighty foe; it was not only much weaker
in strength, being outnumbered fully two to
one at the decisive points where it was threatened,
it was also so disunited in its parts,
that it could hardly collect 60,000 men in
any position to withstand an attack. In fact,
a glance at the map will show that along the
whole line of the Saar and the Lauter it was
exposed to be defeated in detail by a force
infinitely superior in power; and this peril
was aggravated by the circumstance, placed
beyond dispute by the clearest evidence, that
it believed itself completely secure, and that
its leaders were planning a forward movement
while their enemy was close at hand to
destroy them.</p>

<p>It is now well known that a German advance
was not suspected in the French camp
even during the first three days of August:
the woods along the edge of the frontier
were not searched by the French outposts,
and the German columns were allowed to
collect in force behind this deceptive screen
while the Emperor and his Marshals were
dreaming of a march without an obstacle
into the Rhenish provinces. The consequences
of this ruinous neglect and self-deception
became soon evident. On the
4th of August the Crown Prince of Prussia
detached a part of his vast army to attack
the extreme right of the whole French line,
this movement being only the first step of a
general advance across the French frontier.
The Prince, with about 40,000 men, fell
upon a single division of about 10,000 which
lay encamped near the town of Weissenburg,
surprised it, it is said, when at breakfast,
and drove it back in a state of confusion.
The French, rallying on the Geisberg,
made a gallant resistance for a short time;
but the hill having been stormed by the
enemy, they were ultimately driven in utter
rout from beyond Weissenburg on the road
to Strasburg. The first success, so important
in war, had thus been decisively won; the
trophies of the day were 500 prisoners, a
gun, and a great deal of material; and the
advanced guard of the German army stood
in triumph upon the soil of France, the right
wing of the French forces having been
already threatened and struck, and the secret
of their want of preparation having been
disclosed to their able antagonists.</p>

<p>The affair at Weissenburg was only the
prelude of operations of a more serious
kind. The 5th of August was spent by the
Crown Prince in bringing the mass of his
troops forward, and in arraying them for a
formidable attack on the French forces in
his immediate front. There can be no doubt
that in making these dispositions he exposed
his flank to the corps of De Failly, which,
stationed at Bitsche, beyond the Vosges,
ought to have combined with that of McMahon,
and fallen on the right of the Prussian
commander, while, as yet, his columns were
not closed up, and his whole line was somewhat
out of order. This movement, however,
was not executed; the want of intelligence
and the vacillation which characterised
the operations of the French, were again
too painfully conspicuous; and though De
Failly sent one division through the hill
passes to the aid of his colleague, he remained
at Bitsche with the bulk of his troops,
and left MacMahon completely isolated.
Meanwhile that brave, but unfortunate chief,
made preparations to resist the attack of the
Germans, now evidently impending. It is
a misconception to suppose, as some have
done, that he advanced recklessly against
his foe; what he did was to take and occupy
a defensive position on the flank of the
Germans, where he could hope to give them
battle, under circumstances of the least disadvantage,
and De Failly, if he wished, could
come to his aid; and we assert, with confidence,
that this strategy was the best open
to the Duke of Magenta. The marshal by
the evening of the 5th had drawn up his
forces along the crest of a range which extends
from Reichsofen on the left by Woerth
to Elsasshausen, and Marbronn on the right,
and which, with the stream of the Sauer in
front, and with broken ground along the
rising slopes, formed a strong position against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
his enemy. MacMahon's object evidently
was to compel the Germans to turn against
him, and assail him as they changed their
front; he would thus divert them from the
road to Strasburg, and engage them as favourably
for himself as possible; and at the
same time, he as it were summoned the corps
of De Failly to join his rear, while he kept
open several lines of retreat. These were
the arrangements of an able commander;
and considering that MacMahon had not
more than 50,000 men in his band, his dispositions
certainly give proof of the tactical
skill for which he is renowned. On the
morning of the 6th, the Crown Prince advanced
to the attack, with 130,000 men, and
not less than 440 guns. As MacMahon had
calculated, the change of front, which the
Germans were compelled to make, threw
their line for some time into confusion;
and the French repelled for several hours
a somewhat feeble and disunited effort against
their left, at and near Reichsofen. Meantime
the French centre at Woerth had been engaged;
there too, for a considerable time,
MacMahon's divisions resisted stoutly, and
even for a moment assumed the offensive.
But about two o'clock the huge German line
had come up on all sides in strength; and
the Crown Prince prepared to turn the
French wings at both sides, combining with
this an attack in front&mdash;a movement justified
by his superiority in force, but certainly not
without hazard. MacMahon, who, at this
conjuncture, De Failly not having come up,
ought, in our judgment, to have retreated,
struck desperately at the German centre at
Woerth, thinned by the extension of its
flanks; but the French onset was bravely resisted,
and indeed it could not have been
successful. Ere long the formidable outflanking
movement developed itself, and became
decisive; and from Reichsofen to beyond
Marbronn the dense German columns
extended threateningly, and overlapped the
whole French position. A sudden panic fell
on MacMahon's army; its right and centre
gave way; and it was soon a mass of disheartened
fugitives, broken on all sides into
disunited fragments. Six thousand prisoners
and thirty guns were the spoils of the
victorious Germans; and for some time the
defeated force was annihilated, in a military
point of view.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that the Germans' tactics
were remarkable for ability or boldness
during the first part of this desperate battle.
They attacked weakly, and in divided masses;
they gave MacMahon more than one chance;
and with their immense superiority of numbers
their victory ought to have been more
decisive. On the other hand the French
Marshal showed talent in his original dispositions;
he resisted his enemy during several
hours, and at one time placed him in
much danger; and had he when he had been
assured that De Failly's corps was not coming
up, effected a rapid and confident retreat,
he would have been entitled to commendation.
MacMahon, however, held his ground
too long; and when the Crown Prince, who,
as soon as he had ascertained the inferiority
of the French in strength, displayed consummate
energy and skill, had advanced on
Reichsofen and Marbronn, it was almost inevitable
that the French line should give way
and be totally defeated. As regards the conduct
of the opposing armies, the Germans,
cautious and slow at first, became at last self-reliant
and bold; the French fought long with
'consummate bravery,'&mdash;we quote the German
official report&mdash;but they broke up hastily
under the stress of disaster&mdash;a fault almost
a national characteristic. The strategic
consequences of the battle were in the highest
degree important. The whole right wing
of the French army, overpowered by immensely
superior forces, was driven in and
almost destroyed; it had no chance but to retreat
behind the Vosges, too fortunate if it
could make its escape; Alsace was thrown
open to the enemy, and an avenue into the
heart of France laid bare. This result was
in some measure due to the criminal negligence
of De Failly, who, if he had chosen,
might have joined MacMahon, and whose
corps might have changed the fate of the
day; but it was also caused by the bad arrangement
of the whole French line upon
the position, which at no point was in sufficient
strength to offer a firm and certain resistance.
This, indeed, was made evident,
at the same time, at another part of the theatre
of operations. While the Crown Prince
was attacking MacMahon, a German division
of the First Army crossed the Saar and advanced
to Saarbr&uuml;ck, where a few days before
the corps of Frossard had made a demonstration
on the frontier, in order, it has
been supposed, to gratify the curiosity of
the Prince Imperial. The French were completely
surprised; but, pressing hastily forward,
they advanced to repulse the audacious
foe, who with great boldness resisted steadily
for some time. Meanwhile another German
division had come to the aid of their comrades;
and seizing promptly the cover of
woods which overlapped the right of the
French, they wasted it away with a destructive
fire; and further supports having come
up, the Germans stormed with heroic valour
a line of heights called the Spicheren hills,
which formed the front of the French position.
The whole French line had begun to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
give way; and an additional mass of foes
appearing on their extreme left, and having
outflanked it, they retreated in precipitate
haste, leaving a considerable number of guns
and prisoners.</p>

<p>The two engagements of the 6th of August,
named respectively those of Woerth
and Forbach, were fraught with results of
great moment. It was not only that the
renowned French army which had been supposed
to be the first in the world had suffered
a double crushing defeat, in one instance
of a dishonourable kind; not only that it
had lost its prestige and given proof of want
of steadiness, of indiscipline, and of disorganization;
the invasion of Germany was
now impossible; the South had been united
to the North by the pledge of common military
success; and there was nothing to avert
the victorious progress of the German masses
on the French frontier. The situation, in fact,
had been suddenly changed; and Europe,
which up to that moment had been expecting
a French advance, was now to witness the calamitous
recoil of the Imperial forces at all
points, attended with ever increasing disasters.
The right wing of the French army,
well-nigh cut off and destroyed at Woerth,
was driven in rout out of Alsace and compelled
to abandon Strasburg to its fate; and
it would be too fortunate if it could rally at
Ch&acirc;lons, drawing to it the corps of De Failly
and Douay. The right centre, broken through
at Forbach, was forced backward upon
Metz; and the centre and left, involved in
its defeat, were obliged to fall back in the
same direction. Meanwhile the Germans
ably directed, and collected in overwhelming
strength, poured into France in the successive
waves of an invasion that nothing could
resist. The Crown Prince's army, in communication
with the Second by a cordon of
cavalry sent through the Vosges, detached
a part of its force to besiege Strasburg, and
with its remaining divisions poured forward
through Lower Alsace in pursuit of MacMahon.
The Second Army advancing from
the Rhineland, swept across the Saar in immense
forces, and passed into the north of
Lorraine, driving before it the feeble French
corps now seeking a refuge under the guns
of Metz. Meanwhile, the Third Army made
a parallel movement; and, uniting with the
right of the Second, marched rapidly in overwhelming
front on Metz, already threatening
with its right wing to overlap and surround
the great fortress. By the 18th August,
300,000 Germans with large reserves in their
immediate rear had made good their way into
France, and from Strasburg to Thionville
and thence into the heart of Lorraine, were
taking military possession of the country and
menacing with ruin the enemy in their
path.</p>

<p>During this mighty advance of the Germans,
the strategic operations of the French,
in part owing to the bad disposition of their
forces for combined movements, and in part
to the weakness of their commanders, had
been characterised by much indecision.
MacMahon, indeed, had effected his retreat
from the field of Woerth with the wreck of
his troops, and escaped safely through the
Vosges passes; and though his corps was
almost ruined, he had shown some ability
in getting away, for he ought to have been
destroyed by the Germans. In fact, the
pursuit of the Crown Prince had not been
marked by energy or speed, whatever indiscriminate
flatterers may urge; his own reports
more than once refer to the comparative
slackness of his cavalry or at least to their
extreme caution. De Failly, too, though the
disaster at Woerth must be laid to a great
extent to his charge, had been prompt in
breaking up from Bitsche, and he had succeeded
in approaching MacMahon without
being caught by the enemy; his escape,
however, being in a great measure due to the
resistance made by the fortress of Bitsche,
which retarded the march of one of the
Crown Prince's columns. The broken right of
the French army, though its losses had been
terrible, and its morale was destroyed, was, in
a word, making good its way to Ch&acirc;lons;
and, as the corps of Douay was moving towards
it, and as the whole mass was about
to concentrate, we cannot find fault with
these arrangements. But in the remaining
part of the theatre of war the French dispositions
revealed nothing but feebleness, vacillation,
and want of forethought. The
instant Woerth and Forbach were fought,
and the right and right centre of the French
were forced back on either side of the Vosges,
it cannot be doubted that the whole French
army ought to have retreated in a parallel
line; and it ought certainly to have retired
on Ch&acirc;lons, having thrown a strong garrison
into Metz, for it was at Ch&acirc;lons only that it
could hope to reunite, and when there it
would be in a position to save Paris and defend
the interior on the well-known lines of
the Marne and Seine. To effect this would
not have been easy, for the disseminated
state of the corps on the frontier from
Thionville to Forbach and thence backward
to Metz exposed them whatever moves they
attempted; but this was what ought to have
been done, and the attempt would have probably
succeeded. Instead of this the unfortunate
emperor drew in his left and centre
on the Nied&mdash;and when he had collected
these behind the river, he halted five or six
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
days at Metz, uncertain evidently what to do
next, and hesitating, while there was time to
fall back on Ch&acirc;lons. The reason of this
strange and fatal fault, through which the
main body of the French army was exposed
to be cut off and destroyed, remains as yet
to be explained; it was probably owing to
vacillation and to the dread of terrifying
Paris by the news of a general retrograde
movement. While the bulk of the Army of
the Rhine was being detained in camp around
Metz, completely separated from its supports
in Champagne, the German armies advanced
to the Moselle; and while a part of the First
and Second Armies were massed close to the
great fortress a considerable detachment was
thrown forward, to menace and fall on the
French line of retreat should an attempt be
made to retire on Ch&acirc;lons.</p>

<p>The results of these strategic arrangements,
so different in ability and forethought, were
developed ere long with great distinctness.
On the 14th of August one detachment of
the French army with the Emperor at its
head, left Metz and crossed to the left bank
of the Moselle; and this ultimately reached
Ch&acirc;lons, where it effected its junction with
MacMahon. The remaining corps endeavoured
to begin their retrograde movement
the same day, but being on the eastern side
of the fortress, and their great numbers impeding
their march, they were attacked by
two corps of the Germans, whose vigorous
onset held them in check. The combat
lasted the whole day; and each side claimed
to have won the victory; but the real issue
was in favour of the Germans, who detained
their antagonists round Metz, while their
own troops were being pushed forward to
occupy the French line of retreat. Next
day, the 15th, the whole French army began
to defile to the left bank of the Moselle; but
it marched only ten or twelve miles on the
two roads to Verdun and Etain, the avenues
by which it would reach Ch&acirc;lons; and it
bivouacked at Mars La Tour and Doncourt,
still, as it proved, not far from its enemy.
The causes of this disastrous delay, fraught
with consequences of a ruinous kind, remain
yet to be explained; much was doubtless
due to the extreme difficulty of moving columns
of great length and size, encumbered
with baggage and other impediments; and
it is not improbable that a desire to avoid
the appearance of a hasty retreat may have
had influence on the French commanders.
It is certain, however, that a greater distance
should have been accomplished by
the retiring force; it was of vital importance
to get clear at once of the foes gathering
on the flank and rear; and Marshal Bazaine,
who by this time certainly had been
invested with the supreme command, unquestionably
committed a grave error in
not having pressed forward the movement.
The next day it was too late; and the Germans
found themselves in a position to achieve
success, which it is quite clear from their own
despatches, they never expected. On the
morning of the 16th, the retreating French
were attacked on the Verdun road by the
cavalry and infantry of a German corps,
which continued for some hours to hold them
in check; and aid having come to the assailants,
a sanguinary battle raged at Mars La
Tour, one side endeavouring to cut its way
through, the other struggling to bar the passage.
Throughout the day fresh supports
thrown forward judiciously on the flanks of
the French, gave terrible effect to the German
attacks; and their enemy, bound to a
single road, and in their extended columns
fatally exposed, was compelled to fight at a
great disadvantage. The French, however,
fought desperately, aware of the importance
of the issue; and it is possible that they
would have resisted successfully, had it not
been for a brilliant charge of a large mass of
cavalry towards the evening, which forced
them back a considerable distance. Meanwhile,
a simultaneous attack had been made
on the Etain road, and though the French
struggled with great courage, this too ultimately
proved successful. The whole French
army about nightfall withdrew sullenly towards
Metz, having failed to make its retreat
good, and the Germans, closing on its communications,
already stood on its way to
Ch&acirc;lons.</p>

<p>Driven thus to bay under the guns of
Metz, Bazaine resolved to concentrate his
forces in order to fight a decisive battle.
He had probably 130,000 men in hand, with
from 400 to 500 guns, the flower and strength
of the French army; and his plan was to
choose a defensive position where he could
resist the onslaught of the Germans, and,
having repulsed it, could break through
their lines, and get off with the mass of his
troops. With this object he drew up his
men along the summit of a range of uplands,
extending from Gravelotte before Metz, to
beyond the hamlet of Privat La Montagne,
and which, broken by streams and difficult
ground, and with woods, villages, and thickets
in front, offered a strong barrier to an
attacking enemy. The French left rested
on Gravelotte, the centre on Vionville and
Amanvilliers, and the right stretched away
to Doncourt and Jaumont, the whole line
thus holding the roads which debouche to
Verdun, Etain, and Sedan, protected by natural
and artificial obstacles. This was a
position of the strongest kind, considered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
as a scheme of defence, for it exposed the
assailants at most points, and especially at
that of Gravelotte, to a terrible fire at great
disadvantage; but, as the result showed, it
was deficient in this, that it gave no opportunity
for a counter attack, and it enabled
the Germans to draw round from all sides
on the enemy before them. The 17th was
spent by each army in preparing for a decisive
engagement. The German commanders
by this time had 240,000 men, with from
700 to 800 guns, and they resolved to attack
according to a plan, which, if perilous in
some degree, was justified by their superior
numbers, and promised great and remarkable
success. While the right of the Germans
was to restrain the French left, their centre
and left were to march across the whole
front of Bazaine's position, and having overwhelmed
his right wing, the weakest point
in his defensive lines, they were to converge
inwards upon the French and force them
back in retreat on Metz. On the morning
of the 18th, three German corps began to
engage the French at Gravelotte, while at
the same time, five and a half corps moved
towards Vionville and Privat La Montagne,
in order to execute the great turning movement
which was to lead to the expected victory.
The French, immoveable in their
positions, were compelled to await the circling
attack which threatened to stifle and
hem them in; unlike Napoleon I. at Austerlitz,
Bazaine had not secured the means of
striking his enemy as he swept round on
him. Towards the afternoon, the Prussian
guards had outflanked the right of the Marshal;
soon afterwards, his centre was fiercely
assailed, and by degrees the great German
line advanced snakelike to encompass its foe.
It was now time for the German right to
strike fiercely at Gravelotte; and here a
battle of the most desperate kind raged until
nightfall for several hours, the French certainly
having the advantage, and destroying
the Germans with frightful carnage. But
gradually the German plan was worked out;
the German masses converging on all sides
forced the French backward from point to
point; and at last the whole line of defence
gave way, and retreating, slowly fell back
on Metz, having lost the real object of the
battle.</p>

<p>It is not improbable that, in this conflict,
the losses of the Germans exceeded those of
the French. At Gravelotte the corps commanded
by Steinmetz was repeatedly driven
back with terrific slaughter, and at other
points the ranks of the assailants were cruelly
thinned by a destructive fire. But if in a
tactical point of view the battle was hardly
a German victory, and if the resistance of
Bazaine with an inferior force was honourable
to him, the strategic results were great
and decisive. The Germans had now obtained
possession of the entire line of the
Marshal's retreat; they barred the way to
Ch&acirc;lons completely, and he had been forced
back with his army on Metz, where, his
communications with France being cut off,
he would be ultimately compelled to surrender.
Unless he could again begin the contest
and pierce through the encircling foes,
no prospect awaited him but to resist until
famine dashed the sword from his grasp, and
made the army of the Rhine captive&mdash;so
ruinous had been the disastrous generalship
which had detained it in isolation at Metz,
and had allowed its enemies to gather round
it instead of effecting a speedy retreat!</p>

<p>Leaving Bazaine in this perilous strait, we
must now turn to another part of the theatre,
where folly, rashness, and above all the
exigencies of the political situation, were to
complete the work of irresolute weakness in
contributing to the ruin of France. About
the 16th or 17th of August MacMahon had
made good his way to Ch&acirc;lons with the
wreck of his corps defeated at Woerth, and
he was rejoined in a day or two by De Failly,
who had contrived to elude the pursuing
Germans&mdash;a retreat which proves that the
Crown Prince had moved slowly and with
much caution, and had not made the most
of his brilliant victory. About the 19th of
August the corps of Douay, marched back
from Belfort, arrived at Ch&acirc;lons; this body,
at the news of the battle of Woerth, having
properly retired to the great strategic point
which nature and history have alike marked
out as the position where the defence of
France should be undertaken in front of
Paris. Next day, the 20th, about 70,000
men, with more than 100 guns, came up
hastily from the French capital, the Government
under Count Palikao having certainly
made energetic efforts to reorganize and recruit
the army; and thus MacMahon, by
the 21st, had probably about 150,000 men,
with from 400 to 500 guns, under his orders
at the great camp at Ch&acirc;lons. When we
recollect what Napoleon I. accomplished on
this very ground&mdash;the memorable lines of
the Marne and Seine&mdash;with a force greatly
inferior in numbers, against more than
300,000 Germans, it cannot be doubted that
a great commander would have made such
an use of this army that he would long have
kept the invaders back, and possibly changed
the whole situation. But ability and
caution were especially requisite, for the
troops now under MacMahon's orders were
in fact raw or demoralized soldiers; and
plain common sense ought to have suggested
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
that they were not fit for operations that demanded
speed, or that could bring them in
contact with a superior enemy.</p>

<p>At this critical moment a plan was formed,
the responsibility for which is unknown,
but which led to the greatest of military
disasters. Considering the state of MacMahon's
forces, there can be no doubt that his
proper course was to delay his enemies as
they advanced on Ch&acirc;lons, to endeavour to
defend the Marne and the Seine, and, retreating
slowly, to fall back until he had
reached a position at which he would be in
the flank of the Germans as they approached
Paris. A great general, operating in this
way, would have retarded the foe for weeks,
would certainly have inflicted much injury
on him, and while he inured his own troops
to war, would assuredly have kept his army
intact in order to make a stand for the capital,
the fortifications of which, with a force
before them, would perhaps have changed
the issue of the campaign. It is true that
the strategy would have been an apparent
abandonment of Bazaine; but this really
was inevitable. Bazaine, as the event proved,
was not in need of immediate relief;
shut up, as he was, inactive at Metz, he still
detained an immense mass of Germans around
the great fortress; and in any case, as affairs
now stood, the first consideration ought to
have been the security of the last army of
France, and a settled purpose to defend the
capital. Had Wellington been in MacMahon's
place, we are convinced that these
would have been his tactics; and we feel
certain that he would have succeeded, if not
in defeating the Germans in the field, at
least in greatly reducing their strength, in
preserving Paris from real danger, and in
saving his forces for an effort to be undertaken
when his raw troops were rendered
more equal to their antagonists. Instead of
a rational operation like this, a resolve was
made at the French head-quarters which can
only be described as insanely rash. It was
determined to relieve Bazaine with MacMahon's
weak and undisciplined army; and the
manner in which this was to be done was
marked by thoughtless and strange presumption.
The French troops were to leave Ch&acirc;lons,
and moving northwards to Rheims and
Rethel, were to strike from that place across
the Argonnes, to pass the Meuse and attain
Montm&eacute;dy, and descending thence upon
Thionville, were to fall on the rear of the
Germans at Metz, to extricate Bazaine, and
in conjunction with him, to annihilate the
astounded enemy by an attack worthy of
the first Napoleon. By this operation MacMahon's
army was to slip round the flank of
the Crown Prince, known to be advancing
from Nancy on Ch&acirc;lons; it would probably
attain the northern frontier before its destination
could be ascertained; and if it ever
reached the neighbourhood of Metz and
came into communication with Bazaine, what
would be the fate of the insolent invaders,
and what the triumphant issue of a campaign
begun under ill-omened auspices?</p>

<p>Whether the pamphlet recently published
at Brussels be the work of Napoleon III. or
not, it is now clear that Marshal MacMahon
was not the real author of this strategy. A
glance at the map will clearly show that it
exposed the French army to ruinous disaster,
and it has been proved that it was inspired
by the Government of the Regency at Paris,
ill-informed as to the real situation, and
fearful lest a retrograde movement should
cause the sudden fall of the Empire. And
what was the projected operation, which it
was assumed was proposed by an eminent
French Marshal, who, we may suppose, knew
the art of war, and certainly had very great
experience? It was simply to make an immense
flank march with a weak and thoroughly
untrained army, within full reach of
an enemy twice as strong, who would be able
to arrest the movement, and to fall on his
adversary in overwhelming force; and it
was to do this along a line on which a defeat
would probably entail destruction, or a surrender
upon the Belgian frontier. Let it be
granted that MacMahon might expect to
cross the Meuse before he would be intercepted,
still it was all but certain that the
German armies, which assuredly would turn
northward at once, would come up with him
between the Meuse and Thionville; and if
he were caught, what chance had he of contending
against the enormous forces which,
in that event, would be directed against him?
A crushing defeat was to be expected, and
if he were defeated would not his army,
hemmed in along the narrow belt of land
extending from the northern Argmues to
Lorraine, be either utterly broken to fragments
or forced helplessly to lay down its
arms? And it was for a reckless scheme
such as this&mdash;one in which success was
hardly conceivable, and of which ruin would
be the natural result&mdash;that the rational and
legitimate course of retreating leisurely and
defending Paris from point to point, was to
be abandoned! The correspondence recently
published shows that this plan did not
originate with MacMahon; and that it was
adopted must be ascribed to the necessity
felt at the Tuileries of avoiding a retrograde
movement in the interest of the tottering
Empire. MacMahon, however, did consent
to it; and for this he must be held responsible.
Beyond all doubt he ought to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
have rejected a project fraught with calamity
to his country, at the risk even of resigning
his command; had he done so, the position
of France might have been different from
what it is now, and his own reputation
would not have suffered from the consequences
of a dire catastrophe. Making
every allowance for his difficult situation, we
cannot acquit him of want of resolution,
though sheer ignorance and incapacity did
not lead him to make the greatest of blunders
ever made perhaps by a commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>Our space precludes us from describing at
length the series of great events that ensued.
On the 22nd of August MacMahon's army,
already giving melancholy proofs of weakness,
indiscipline, and insubordination, had
reached Rheims from the camp of Ch&acirc;lons;
and on the 23rd it was on its way to Rethel.
The march of the columns was extremely
sluggish, in consequence of the bad organisation
of the troops, and eye-witnesses
have recorded that the unfortunate marshal
was even now evidently dispirited and anxious.
Rethel was not passed until the 25th;
and as the movement to the Meuse and the
Argmues was to be accomplished as soon as
possible, MacMahon divided his army into
three parts; one to go northward, by railway
to M&eacute;zi&egrave;res, and the other two to advance
easterly by Vouziers and Nouart, and Le
Ch&egrave;ne and Stonne. The Emperor and his
ill-fated child attended mournfully the doomed
army, but if we are to credit newspaper
reports, Napoleon III. still felt confident that
he was marching to assured victory. Though
the dispositions of the French marshal were
evidently made with a view to speed, the
movement of his columns was exceedingly
slow, no doubt owing to their inefficient
state, and also probably to commissariat defects;
and even by the morning of the 29th
they had only attained Nouart and Stonne,
that is, they were still a day's march from the
Meuse, which they ought to have found on
the 28th. These delays aggravating the inherent
perils of a strategic plan essentially
vicious, were sure to lead to disastrous consequences;
and while MacMahon had been going
northwards the German commanders had
been preparing the means of utterly overwhelming
him. On the 19th and 20th of August,
after Bazaine had been shut up in Metz,
a fourth German army had been despatched,
under the command of the Crown Prince of
Saxony, to co-operate with that of the Crown
Prince of Prussia, and it had been moved
by Verdun, on St. Menehould, to be in readiness
for any event. Meanwhile the third German
army, after passing Nancy, had advanced
on the great road to Paris to Ligny and Bar
le Duc, its light cavalry, the well-known Uhlans,
having scoured the whole country to
beyond Ch&acirc;lons. By the 24th the Crown
Prince of Prussia, who had been rejoined by
the king from Metz, had his head-quarters at
Bar le Duc, and when there the news arrived
that MacMahon had broken up from the
camp, and was aiming northward toward
M&eacute;zi&egrave;res and Rethel. The plan of the
French was immediately perceived by the
eminent strategist who in this campaign had
been the genius of the German armies, and
he proceeded to defeat it, and ensure victory.
Orders were at once issued to the Crown
Prince of Saxony to move northerly towards
the Meuse, and intercept the heads of MacMahon's
columns; while the third German
army, under the Prussian Prince, was to advance
rapidly in the same direction, and fall
on the French flank and rear. By the 25th
the huge German array, numbering nearly
250,000 men, with from 700 to 800 guns,
was marching forward in dense masses to
overwhelm the much weaker force that incautiously
presented its flanks to it, and that
soon would be within its formidable reach.</p>

<p>By the 28th and 29th of August the game
began to be gradually developed. The vanguard
of the Tenth German Army, having
passed Verdun and reached the Meuse, appears
to have crossed the river at Stenay, and
it struck one of MacMahon's columns about
Buzancy and again at Nouart. Meanwhile
the army of the Crown Prince of Prussia
advancing by Clermont, Grand Pr&eacute;, and
Suippes, had closed on the flank and rear of
the Marshal and had made it certain that he
would be overtaken. Headed thus, as they
approached the Meuse, and threatened with
a destructive attack, which, if successful,
would prove ruinous, the French were compelled
to diverge northwards, and MacMahon
endeavoured to make his escape though
his case was already well-nigh desperate.
Drawing one of his columns towards the other,
and leaving a strong rear-guard at Beaumont,
with orders to make a determined resistance,
he sought to concentrate his remaining forces,
and having passed the Meuse between Sedan
and Mouzon, to move rapidly on Carignan,
and thence to march direct on Montm&eacute;dy,
thus eluding the tightening grasp of the
Prussians. In these operations we see the
windings of a general who feels that a disaster
is at hand; but, situated as MacMahon
was, they were the best that could have been
made. By the morning of the 30th the
whole French army, except the corps at Beaumont,
was collected from Leth&ecirc;ne to near
Stenay; and it has been said that the unhappy
Emperor was still confident as to the issue.
His powerful antagonists were not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
likely to allow their prey to slip out of their
clutches. The German columns on the 29th
had closed more firmly on their retiring enemy;
and while a portion of the Fourth
Army had taken possession of both banks of
the Meuse, the Third was in readiness to attack
Beaumont, and to press MacMahon as he
crossed the river. These dispositions assured
success which could hardly fail to be ultimately
decisive. As the French army approached
the Meuse, the Crown Prince of
Prussia made an attack on the detachment
which had been left at Beaumont; and these
corps, commanded by the incapable De Failly,
were overwhelmed after a feeble resistance.
Meanwhile MacMahon had contrived to get
two of his corps across the river, which had
marched towards Carignan; but as the remaining
ones were passing they were caught
and routed by the Crown Prince of Prussia
with a great loss of guns and men at Mouzon.
At the same time the Fourth German
Army advancing from the right bank of the
Meuse, had driven the French from the road
to Carignan; and thus the whole French army
baffled and defeated was forced in confusion
still further northward. By the evening
of the 30th its routed divisions had been
re-formed in front of Sedan behind the defensive
line of the Chiers, the huge German
forces gathering all round and hemming in
their intended victim.</p>

<p>We can only devote a few sentences to describe
the decisive battle that ensued. The
31st of August was spent by MacMahon in
drawing up his army in a line of defence extending
from Givonne on the Belgian frontier,
across ranges of eminences in front of
Sedan, and thence backward to the rear of
the town, as far as the plateaux of La Garenne
and Floiny. The left of the Marshal rested
on Giomne, his centre protected by the
Chiers and by the villages of Bazeilles and
Balan, spread before Sedan in strong positions,
and his right and right centre stretched
beyond Sedan, holding the Meuse nearly
to Floiny northwards. The Fourth German
army in the meantime had been marched on
the opposite bank of the Chiers, while that
of the Crown Prince had come up to the
Meuse in full force; and the German commanders
now pursued the plan of hemming
in MacMahon completely, and having forced
him upon Sedan, of destroying him by their
overwhelming strength. With this object
the French left was to be turned and passed
by, the centre was to be fiercely assailed, the
right was to be surprised and struck, and
the whole German armies, having united in a
perfect circle around Sedan, were to accomplish
the ruin of their entrapped enemy.
Considering the extraordinary disproportion
between the hosts about to join in battle&mdash;230,000
men at least with from 600 to 700
guns against 110,000 of inferior quality with
one-third less pieces&mdash;this ambitious and astonishing
design may be justified in a military
point of view; but, notwithstanding all
that has been said, it is by no means to be
admired in its conception; and a great commander,
who in such a position, should break
out from the centre with resolute troops,
might cause an attack of this kind to end in
a terrible defeat. On the morning of the 1st,
the Fourth German Army, in consequence of
the neglect of the French outposts, effected
the passage of the Chiers without loss; and
its right soon turned the French left at Givonne,
the defenders of that important point
having offered only the feeblest resistance.
At the same time a considerable part of the
forces of the Crown Prince having crossed
the Meuse during the previous night, attacked
Bazeilles and Balan in great strength;
but here the French showed a bold front, and
the battle hung in suspense for hours. Meanwhile,
however, the remaining corps of the
Third German Army had faced the Meuse at
a point much lower down the river, and falling
on the extreme right of the French at or
near a hill that commands Floiny, had driven
it in after a brave defence, and placed
themselves in communication with the victorious
troops of the German army which had
approached them from Givonne. The inner
circle was now completed; the French centre
still fighting obstinately was obliged to
evacuate Bazeilles and Balan; and the whole
French army was compelled to recoil inwards
upon Sedan, where it was crushed by a death-dealing
artillery. No alternative but a surrender
remained; the German tactics had
completely succeeded; and on the 2nd of
September, the last army of France in the
field had passed under the yoke, and was a
mass of prisoners of war. The Emperor was
one of the trophies of the conqueror; MacMahon,
more fortunate, had been severely
wounded and did not witness the capitulation;
but upwards of 90,000 men and from
400 to 500 guns in the hands of the triumphant
Germans attested the magnitude of
the catastrophe.</p>

<p>The results of the terrible battle of Sedan&mdash;a
catastrophe unparalleled in the annals of
war&mdash;were the destruction of the only French
army that remained to the nation in the
field, the complete isolation of Bazaine at
Metz with a certainty of his ultimate surrender,
the exposure of Paris to an immediate
siege, and the prospect of the subjection
of France to the will of an implacable
conqueror. At no conjuncture in
military history has a strategic error of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
gravest kind been fraught with such calamitous
effects; and the march to Sedan will
long be noted as one of those frightful mistakes
of generalship which have deeply influenced
the fate of kingdoms. A day or
two after this dire event a revolution
broke out in Paris; the empire collapsed
with the captive Emperor; the Empress
Regent was compelled to fly; and, although
a Government of National Defence
was formed, composed of men of very great
eminence, who&mdash;after fruitless attempts to
negotiate&mdash;bravely resolved to carry on the
struggle, sooner than consent to the dismemberment
of France, hardly anyone believed
that the defeated nation would be
able to offer serious resistance. The situation
of France, indeed, appeared desperate
even to her well-wishers&mdash;even to those who
resented the dictum of the cynical scorner
of popular rights, that whether their inhabitants
liked it or not, Alsace and Lorraine
'would belong to Prussia'&mdash;and for several
weeks her exulting enemies remained absolute
masters of the situation, and trampled
down the defenceless country. The German
armies which had fought at Sedan marched
without a moment's delay to Paris, arrived
before the forts on the 18th September,
and, having routed a few raw troops, who
endeavoured to harass them at Versailles, invested
the capital on all sides, and inclosed
it in impenetrable lines. The surging waves
of the tremendous invasion meanwhile flowed
furiously over the northern provinces,
carrying with them devastation and ruin.
Strasburg, after a siege which clearly indicated
the temper of the people of Alsace,
and their assumed sympathy with their 'German
liberators,' fell on the 29th September;
most of the fortresses of the Vosges, with
the exception of Bitsche and Phalsburg, submitted;
Toul, which had gallantly resisted
for weeks a whole army, met the same fate,
and by the close of October the German
hosts had cleared their communications with
Paris, were masters of the whole region between
the Seine and the Rhenish Provinces,
and had laid hold of Picardy and the valley
of the Loire, which locust-like they devoured
by requisitions. The consummation seemed
at hand, when after making many attempts
to break the iron ring of his foes, Bazaine
on the 27th of October surrendered the fortress
he had so long held; and the whole remains
of the army of the Rhine, the garrison,
and a mass of auxiliary troops, became prisoners
of war as they defiled from Metz.
France seemed under the Caudine forks; the
iron had entered into her soul; and even the
most far-sighted observers believed that the
end of the war was close at hand.</p>

<p>For two whole months after the battle of
Sedan, France thus appeared altogether ruined,
trampled under the hoof of a ruthless
invader. Her capital was invested; her
provinces were overrun; fortress after fortress
became an easy prey; the grasp
of the Prussian upon the country seemed
day after day to become stronger, and
few signs of resistance appeared except a
desultory partisan warfare. Some military
critics at Versailles exclaimed that the 'hour
of the Latin race had come;' the King of
Prussia piously resigned his spirit to the triumph
that seemed close at hand; Bismark
with grim humour declared that Paris was
'frying in its own fat;' writers disposed
complacently of Lorraine and Alsace, and
congratulated France that her fate was no
worse, and only a small minority of Englishmen
entertained a hope for the fallen nation.
Yet during all that terrible time vitality was
returning to the stricken frame, and France
was preparing for mighty efforts which,
whether they prove successful or not, have
been some of the noblest in history, and are
entitled to the highest admiration. The
first symptom of reviving animation was
seen in the attitude of Paris, which, under
the control of General Trochu, a commander
who has already won a high place in the
annals of fame, put off her Sybarite pride
and luxury, and from behind her ramparts
prepared herself for a defence which must
be pronounced astonishing. Day after day
the immense capital which the Germans declared
would consume itself by internal revolution
and anarchy, and which was not
expected to hold out a fortnight, encompassed
itself with fresh defensive lines, drilled
its raw levies within its walls, and arrayed
itself in such a panoply of war that before
long it had become evident that its speedy
reduction was impossible. The bombardment
which it was predicted would soon
'bring these fools to their senses,' was postponed
for the simple reason, that it had not
the faintest chance of success; and as amazed
Europe beheld the works of Paris growing
in formidable power, and actually threatening
the investing circle, it learned to set a
proper value on the profession that 'there
was no intention to destroy by fire a noncombatant
population,' as if starvation was a
more humane process. Meanwhile silently,
and hardly observed by the correspondents
of the English Press, enormous preparations
for the renewal of the contest were made in
every part of the country. Arms were produced
in prodigious quantities, old soldiers
were recalled to their colours, recruits were
summoned in hundreds of thousands, the
nuclei of several armies were formed, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
the splendid memories of 1793-4 were invoked
by the representatives of the people,
and created wide-spread martial enthusiasm.
While Bismark jeered at the 'gentlemen of
the pavement,' and cynically redoubled his
confident insults, while telegram after telegram
announced that town after town was
capitulating, France was becoming a vast
camp, and sternly, proudly, and in a very
different spirit from that in which it began
the war, the nation girded up its loins for
the strife. M. Gambetta, whose journey
from Paris in a balloon excited considerable
ridicule at Versailles&mdash;for a while&mdash;was the
mainspring of this remarkable movement, of
which, if we cannot predict the success, the
patriotism and force cannot be disputed.</p>

<p>The first symptom in the turn of the tide
which made itself distinctly perceived, was
an engagement which took place on the
9th of November. A mass of raw levies
and dep&ocirc;t battalions, to which had been
given the name of the Army of the Loire,
had been driven out of Orleans in October;
and it was generally supposed that it had
been all but destroyed. But a general had
been placed at its head who had given it
consistency and strength; it had been furnished
with good artillery, and on the ninth
of November it recrossed the Loire and defeated
the Bavarian force in its front, which
it succeeded in almost surrounding. After
this the nuclei of armies, in the west, the
north, and the south-east of France, have
made their appearance, and are growing formidable;
and the military strength of what
had been deemed the effete and worn-out
nation, has shown itself to be great and
threatening. The attitude of the armies of
the Loire and of the West has compelled
the Germans to draw in almost their whole
available forces to cover the immense circle
of their lines around Paris; and though as
yet they have suffered no reverse, and have
even gained some important successes, their
enemies still confront them in the field with
rapidly improving power and discipline, and
so long as they hold their present positions,
they are exposed to considerable danger. In
fact the German armies round Paris would
be placed in imminent peril, if the covering
armies on the circumference outside, were to
meet anything like a defeat; and as the
French levies are day after day acquiring an
increase of numbers and force, this is by no
means an impossible contingency. Meanwhile
the beleaguered capital of France has
offered to the besiegers a resistance which
has astonished and confounded the world,
and its illustrious governor, General Trochu,
has literally created out of the young and
demoralised troops within its walls, armies
of unquestionable valour and worth. These
armies commenced offensive operations on
the 29th and 30th November, by making immense
sorties from the capital; and though
they have not succeeded in breaking through
the net which hems them in, it is not impossible
that they may yet do so. The situation,
in fact, has so completely changed since
the beginning of the month of November,
that all competent persons now think that if
Paris can hold out five or six weeks more,
the result may be fatal to the Germans. It
is almost useless to speculate on events
which may be solved before these lines shall
be printed, but we venture to hazard a
glance into the future. It appears to us
that in all probability Paris will ultimately
succumb to famine, that it will not be relieved
from without, and that General Trochu
and his brave troops will have to yield to
adverse fortune. This blow, if it happens,
will be terrible, but if France continues to
evince the resolution and energy of the last
two months, its military consequences need
not be decisive. In that event the defence
of France will have to be undertaken on the
Loire; and if her young armies are carefully
husbanded; if her generals and statesmen
admit the truth that the siege of Paris has
gained time for developing her restored vigour;
and if no fatal mistakes are made, we
believe that she yet may repel the invader.
What is most to be feared is, that if Paris
falls, a collapse of authority may ensue, that
Red Republicanism may lift its head, and
that the men who have done such eminent
service, may be overthrown by popular fear
and terror. But if France is true to herself,
if she goes on as she has done lately, and if
her forces are rationally handled, she may
possibly succeed in shaking off her assailants,
and avoid the dismemberment with
which she is threatened. Let the nation
comprehend that if Paris falls, it will have
done wonders in gaining time, and in allowing
the spirit of France to revive, and then
let it go on with the contest, obedient as a
man to the existing Government, and looking
steadily to the one great object, deliverance
from impending subjugation.</p>

<p>Such has been, up to the middle of December,
the memorable war of 1870. We
have well-nigh exhausted our space, and can
only make a few brief reflections. History
has yet to describe the real causes of this
terrible and devouring conflict, and the persons
really responsible for it; but, allowing
that Napoleon was in the wrong for throwing
down the gauntlet to Prussia, what is now
to be thought of the Power which is carrying
on an internecine contest after she has
received offers of ample compensation, and is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
endeavouring to dismember France, and to
annex two of her most loyal provinces for
the sole purpose, we fear, of making her
former rival her vassal? Ever since the interview
with Bismark at Ferri&egrave;res, when,
after Sedan, M. Jules Favre proposed to give
Prussia more than satisfaction for all losses
incurred by her, the war has been one of
simple conquest on the part of King William
and his minister. France, who at the outset
of the conflict may have been, at least
through her ruler, in the wrong, is now fighting
against an invader for her national existence
and her place in history; and beaten
down as she is, it is not impossible that she
may yet succeed; certainly she is rapidly
winning the sympathy which was at first
denied her. It is creditable to the mind of
England, which was at first almost unanimously
on the side of Germany, believing
that it was unjustly attacked, that the majority
of our countrymen are beginning to
see through the ambition of Prussia, to distrust
the cynical fraud of Bismark, and to
wish well to the nation which is now really
fighting for all that makes life dear. But it
may be said, 'France has been beaten; the
victor offers her peace on the terms of the
cession of Alsace and Lorraine, which after
all were at one time German; why does she
not admit her overthrow, and thus restore
quiet to awed Europe?' But to such suggestions,
France, we believe, will not listen.
We do not see how, until her resources are
destroyed, she can consent to abandon
Alsace and Lorraine, because these provinces
are absolutely necessary to her safety as an
important Power, as any military student
must know; nor ought she, as a leader of
civilization, to give up populations devoted
to her to invaders whom they detest. As
for the ethnological argument derived from
the German origin of their territories, France
may fairly adduce their present attitude as
evidence of the real sentiments of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>We cannot dwell at the present moment
on the lessons to be deduced from this war.
Those who think that it conclusively proves
the superiority of the German over the
French soldier, will do well to read a little
history and to study the battles of Jena and
Austerlitz. No doubt on several occasions
the French have fought badly under the
moral depression of repeated and overwhelming
defeats; but nothing has yet been seen
in this campaign compared to the demoralization
of Prussia in 1806. Nor may we assume
that the French military character has
deteriorated, though a corrupt layer of Imperialism
has injured the upper ranks of society;
the nation which after crushing reverses
can still show such an indomitable
front, will be yet found by its foes to be terrible.
What the campaign proves is the
immense superiority of German generalship
over its antagonists, a superiority which, seconded
by irresistible force, and by great
advantages in artillery, has produced results
of an astonishing kind, yet not more marvellous
than those witnessed sixty years ago on
the other side when Napoleon commanded
the Grand Army. As to the military operations
of the French commanders, they have
been throughout as bad as possible. From
the outset of the campaign to the first battles
we see nothing but reckless rashness; we
then behold vacillation and weakness followed
by the astonishing blunders of Sedan;
and the news which has just arrived of the
defeats of the Army of the Loire at Orleans,
prove, we fear, that another series of mistakes
in the plainest strategy have been committed.
These have been the causes of the
disasters of France of which an able adversary
has reaped the advantage; and to these
we should add the enervating results of Imperialism
on the upper classes, corruption
and peculation in the higher ranks of the
army, the false confidence engendered by
martial traditions, and not least, the numerical
inferiority of the French forces to those
of the Germans. Yet we do not doubt that
if France continues her present resolute attitude,
if common sense prevails in her councils,
if she remains united and patriotic, she
may yet pluck safety out of her dangers;
and in a long and internecine struggle the
Power which has the command of the sea,
superior wealth, and more compact unity,
may in our judgment ultimately triumph.
For ourselves this cruel and fearful war
ought to teach us to look after our national
defences, to array ourselves in complete
panopoly, to take good assurance that this
England of ours, the home of freedom and
good government, shall at least be secure in
the shock of arms now crashing over a large
part of the Continent. It cannot be questioned
that the sudden rise of Bismarkian
Prussia is a threat and a peril to the world;
the demands of Gortschakoff and the letters
of Bernstorff already prove that it bodes no
good to England; and we shall do better to
look after our fleets, and to put our military
organization in order, than to believe the
idyls of sentimental professors who assure us
that the plunderer of Silesia, the divider of
Poland, and the despoiler of Denmark, is
'wise, pious, moral, and unambitious.' If it
is not our duty to interfere actively in the
interest of the balance of Europe, we, at
least, in the conflict now rending France
ought to read a warning address to ourselves;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
and while the boundaries of nations
are being shifted, while justice and right are
in danger of being trampled under foot, that
brute force may work its will, we ought to
take good heed that this our England shall
retain her high position in the world, shall
be able when necessary to lift her hand in
the cause of civilization and human progress,
shall never 'lie' at the proud foot of a conqueror,
shall be as powerful as she is great
and glorious.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>History of England, from the Earliest to the
Present Time.</i> In Five Volumes. By Sir
<span class="smcap">Edward S. Creasy</span>, M.A., Emeritus Professor
of History in University College, London;
late Fellow of King's College, Cambridge.
Vol. II. Completing the History during the
Early and Middle Ages. Walton. 1870.</p>

<p>Sir Edward Creasy's second volume embraces
nine reigns, from Edward II. to Richard III.,
both inclusive. We consider the strong point
of it, and that which has had most of the writer's
heart, to be the constitutional and social
history. The narrative of public and military
transactions has not the same merit; and especially
that towards the latter end, including the
Wars of the Roses, which is too compressed&mdash;we
had almost said too perfunctory&mdash;to be even
interesting. In the earlier portions, where the
author takes all the room that he wants, he lets
us see that he does not lack the power of placing
the events of war in an instructive light.
Coming to Edward III.'s reign, he corrects the
impression that is probably entertained by
many, that the great contest with France arose
from a wanton and ambitious claim upon the
crown of that kingdom; and shows, by a very
careful statement of facts and dates, that it was
Philip of Valois' war, not Edward's.</p>

<p>Few of our historians have attempted thoroughly
to penetrate Edward's plan in that
famous expedition of 1346-7, in which he traversed
the North of France, landing at La
Hogue, and embarking at Calais, just as though
it had been a piratical expedition needing no
further explanation. Sir Edward makes a
good suggestion as to the commencement and
early stage of the invasion; namely, that one
great object of it was to deliver a blow at the
nourishing woollen manufactures of Normandy,
and thereby relieve English trading towns from
their powerful competitors in that quarter.
But we think he fails to account satisfactorily
for Edward's movements after the taking of
Caen, when he assigns it as a sufficient reason
for his advance on Paris (after being obliged to
turn away from Rouen, be it remembered), that
he wished to divert French troops from the
South of France, where a small English army
was being hard pressed. But could not the
king of England have effected such a purpose
by establishing himself in Normandy, where he
rested on his fleet? To dismiss his ships, as
he did at Caen, and to take a moderate force of
some 40,000 men into the interior without a
base of operations, in the hope of relieving a
distant province, would not have been worthy
of the genius of Edward III. We have little
doubt that after achieving his success as far as
Caen, if not before, Calais itself (not Paris, nor
yet Guienne) was in his eye. In fact, the
speech of Sir Geoffrey Harcourt to Edward, at
Caen, reported by Froissart, distinctly recognises
Calais as the ultimate goal of the expedition.
His having found the North of France so
defenceless (to say nothing of his having taken
prisoner at Caen the Count of Guisnes, on the
border of whose territory Calais lay), probably
suggested the feasibility of capturing Calais on
the land side. Hence the immediate attempt
to cross the Seine at Rouen; and hence, when
this failed, the march up the Seine&mdash;not to relieve
Guienne, but to effect a passage of the
river. The famous fortress fell to Edward as
the result of a bold calculation, not as a piece
of good luck after a desperate escapade. To
judge how tempting it must have seemed to
him, even so far off as Caen, we have only to
reflect on the immediate use he made of it as
soon as it was his own; to say nothing of his
resolution in maintaining a longer winter siege.
He immediately converted what had before
been a piratical stronghold against him into an
English colony; besides which he made it the
Continental staple for the English wool trade,
by which means he delivered himself from certain
Flemish towns, which hitherto had converted
his necessities into their own gains.
Those who understand something of English
State finance in this reign, and the peculiar importance
of the woollen trade to Edward as a
financier, will be able to comprehend his views
when he resolved on obtaining hold of this important
position upon the Straits of Dover.</p>

<p>In a fresh history of Edward III.'s reign,
various episodes, of minor importance, indeed,
but ineradicable from the English mind, will
always be turned to, to see how far the new
lights will permit the old favourites of the popular
imagination to stand their ground. Let
us turn, then, to the Ostrich Feathers. Mr.
Longman, in his recent 'Life of Edward III.,'
simply remarks that the current story is a very
doubtful one; while Sir Edward Creasy's remark
is, that there is no reason at all to doubt
it. But passing observations like these, on the
one side or on the other, entirely fail to do justice
to a very interesting series of papers (not
referred to by either of these authors), that
may and ought to be read in the 'Arch&aelig;ologia,'
mentioning the curious discovery of a
contemporary statement of the popular story
(Camden having been hitherto the earliest authority
for it), which, nevertheless, cannot
overcome the strong evidence marshalled by the
learned antiquaries, that the feathers really
came from Hainault, and through Queen Philippa,
not from Bohemia at all, or its gallant
old king. The story of the six haltered citizens
of Calais Sir Edward accepts likewise,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
and finds himself able to support it by fresh
evidence. In fact, there was never any sufficient
reason to doubt it, and our historic scepticism
is apt sometimes to be over-scrupulous. For
the anecdote, singular as it is, is by no means
unique: the incident mentioned in 1 Kings, xx.
31, if not strictly parallel, was quite sufficient
to have originated the custom in the picturesque
days of the Middle Ages, with the
genius of which, too, it entirely harmonises.
Monstrelet records a similar instance in the campaigns
of the Duke of Bedford, in the following
century; and another in Papal history, belonging
to 1540, may be read in Ranke.</p>

<p>A narrative work ought not to be dismissed
without an examination of its dates. And
here we are obliged to admit that our narrator
has not shown sufficient vigilance. The death
of Roger Mortimer, Queen Isabella's favourite,
is undated, although we are carefully told that
Edward III.'s real reign only began from that
event. One-half of the narrative of his overthrow
is on a page headed 1328, and the other
half under 1330. The death of the Black
Prince is described and its importance to public
affairs is acknowledged, but it is undated.
The page on which it is narrated is headed
1376; but the next page, dealing with the
events of the moment, is dated 1377. The
battle of Cressy is dated August 25th, a day
too soon. Henry V.'s setting sail for the Agincourt
campaign is twice on one page dated Sunday,
August 12th, instead of Sunday, August
11th. The Duke of Bedford engages the enemy at
the mouth of the Seine on August 18th (it
should be 13th), returning home August 16th.
The famous coronation of Charles VII. at
Rheims, when the Maid of Orleans assisted, is
dated July 18th, instead of Sunday, July 17th.
Lord Talbot fell in the battle of Castillon, and
this is dated July 23rd, a date of that hero's
death quite new to us, although we have seen
four others recorded. But we do not at all
feel confident that our author gives this figure
as the result of any special inquiry. We are
sure that our writers will never be induced to
guard wakefully against the crime of circulating
false dates until their eyes are thoroughly
open to the dreadful state in which our popular
chronology stands, making it unsafe for us to
adopt any figures whatever without every means
of verification in our power.</p>

<p>We have expressed ourselves freely as to
where this volume might, in our opinion, have
been stronger. We therefore gladly invite attention
to what we have felt Sir Edward Creasy's
chief success to be, and to what we consider
our chief gains in possessing this record
of his studies.</p>

<p>The constitutional and social history of the
period comprised in this volume will soon attract
the reader's warm interest; for he will
perceive that it is not merely inserted for the
sake of filling up a department, but written <i>con
amore</i>, and out of full stores of knowledge.
The author has made diligent and zealous use
of the numerous and valuable works published
under the Master of the Rolls, and has not lost
sight of the researches of our local antiquarian
societies, and other good authorities. Matters
which in most current histories are simply referred
to as known, and which therefore remain
long unknown, such as obsolete medi&aelig;val
taxes, the nature of impeachment, the council,
and the like, are here carefully explained,
which makes the history popular in the best
sense, as well as a thorough student's book.
What he calls the Thirty Years' War between
capital and labour, from the Black Death to
Wat Tyler, is a most lucid and interesting piece
of social history, fully worked out, and by no
means useless in view of present-day questions.
As the result, Tyler's insurrection, as
well as Cade's, will wear a new complexion, we
suspect, in the minds of many general readers.</p>

<p>One feature of Sir Edward's pages will certainly
gratify not a few; we mean the conspicuous
absence of partisanship and all unfairness
of statement. While forming his judgments
on the past, he succeeds in throwing
himself into the times he is describing, and
consequently preserves a calm and reasonable
tone, without being querulous and hasty. A
striking instance of this judicial temper occurs
in his account of persecuting Arundel and the
frightful statute <i>De heretico Comburendo</i>, the
tenor of his observations on which we hope no
one will be so uncandid as to misunderstand or
misrepresent. The danger of such a habit of
mind is, of course, a liability to that amiable
weakness which wants to whitewash everybody
and palliate everything; but this danger we
think Sir Edward succeeds in avoiding. He has
a moral firmness of his own, and an independence
of mind which would not permit him to be
simply an allowance-maker. If we wanted a
proof that he has his strong partialities, unfalteringly
expressed in the right direction, we should
point to his chapter on Wycliffe, which also is
the weightier, from its being, as usual, discriminating.
Here, facing the great religious
movement of the Reformation, our historian expresses
himself as a Christian believer, and
one who venerates the Holy Bible, and as
though he considered himself writing for those
who ought to be both.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>Lectures and Essays</i>. By Professor <span class="smcap">Seeley</span>.
Macmillan &amp; Co.</p>

<p>To those who are acquainted with 'Ecce
Homo,' we need not say that this is an interesting
volume. There is something so fresh
and bold, so frank and vigorous in all that Professor
Seeley writes, that we must enjoy reading
him, whether we agree with him or not,
and whatsoever topic he discusses.</p>

<p>He writes on the 'Revolution at Rome,' and
on the 'Decline and Fall of the Empire,' with
a masterly grasp on an obscure and complex
subject. We entirely agree with him in his
estimate of Julius C&aelig;sar's motives and character;
and while we acquit Brutus himself of
any mean and sordid impulse, we cannot think
that he served Rome or humanity in the 'taking
off' of the Dictator. If we can trust Sallust
at all, the nobles for whom Pompey fought
were quite unfit to govern Rome. Our author's
explanation of the final fall of the Empire has
more than probability. The facts justify it to
a large extent. Wherever population is at a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
standstill, we may be sure 'there is something
rotten in the State,' and may confidently anticipate
its dissolution. Is not the prostrate
condition of France at the time we write another
illustration of the truth? Have not similar
causes there produced like effects?</p>

<p>Our author's analysis of Milton's opinions
and his critique on Milton's poetry, deserve perusal.
He appreciates the solitary grandeur
of the gentle and cultivated Puritan,&mdash;Titanic,
yet not coarse. It is not easy to reconcile the
utter disappointment, the deep heart-sorrow,
of Milton's old age with his uniform hopefulness.
All the more honour to him! There is nothing
more paralyzing than despair. We doubt
whether it should ever find utterance in a
Christian's writing. We at once recognise the
parallelism of Carlyle's position with Milton's in
some aspects of it. We were taken aback to
hear of Ruskin in a similar aspect, but our author
makes out a good case for him too.</p>

<p>Nothing can be juster in our view than the
'Essay on Art.' These 'elementary principles'
must be recognised, one is apt to say, by
all thoughtful men, and we are greatly indebted
to the Professor for setting them forth so
clearly. We cannot too soon adopt the principle
that 'art is not always independent, but
in some cases parasitic; and accordingly, in
judging particular performances, in architecture
and oratory, it is necessary to apply two standards
in succession&mdash;the practical and the artistic
... the decisive test of merit "here" being
art in subordination.'</p>

<p>Surely no one has more right than he to
speak with authority on 'University Education.'
And his strictures upon the course at Cambridge,
and the effects of it upon both teachers
and taught, are well worthy of attention.
Somehow or other it is true that life-long study
is not secured by present methods, and it is a
topic deserving of careful discussion. 'Why
is it so, and how can it be mended?' With a
great deal advanced in this searching essay we
heartily agree, and we are glad to see that some
suggestions in it are already being acted upon.
Many more we hope and expect will become the
usage of the future. We were pleased, not
surprised, to find him frankly acknowledging,
that in one important particular the method at
Oxford is to be preferred to that at Cambridge.
It is not a little humbling to us as a nation to
have him say parenthetically (not as 'thesis'
to be maintained&mdash;observe&mdash;but as an axiom&mdash;an
unquestioned truth) that 'most good books
are in German.'</p>

<p>Again, in regard to the study of 'English in
Schools.' Who so competent as he to speak?
With all that he says about the duty of teaching
more fully in our schools, both the language
and literature of our country, we heartily
agree, though we are not prepared to go with
him quite so far as to say, 'No Latin at all till
a boy is fourteen.' The 'accidence' of any
language are more easily learnt by young
minds&mdash;it is a mere effort of memory, and
strengthens it&mdash;while in later life such matters
cannot be learnt as accurately, in our conviction.
We hold with him, however, respecting the
English, and are inclined therefore, in this matter,
to the rule, 'Then ought ye to do, and not
to leave the other undone.'</p>

<p>The strictures on preaching, again, are excellent.
How well it will be if all our young
preachers ponder them well! The world needs,
and more than that, it likes practical preaching,
if it be intelligent, sympathetic, and sincere.
Every word he says about 'political
preaching' we would gladly endorse. Surely
it is as much within a Christian teacher's
sphere as the domestic relations, and we believe
that greater fidelity in the pulpit on the
subject of political morality, will be followed
by a great advance at the poll. Men are willing
to be told where they are wrong and ought
to amend, if only it be a true man who tells
them so. Wherever one who is 'bone of their
bone' speaks 'to them on vital topics, men
will come and hear. They will not then leave
the Church to the women and the children.'</p>

<p>With the inaugural address at Cambridge
the volume closes. His subject, 'History, a
Teacher of Politics,' promises much, and we
are inclined to envy those who are in the way
of hearing the discourses to which this one is
preamble and preface. May they profit by them
as much as we think we should, and our children
reap the fruits in the wiser legislation of
the coming generation of statesmen! Somewhere
lately, we have seen the doctrine put
forth, with marvellous confidence, that 'the history
of the past cannot give wisdom for the future,
inasmuch as Society is ever progressing,
and no past state therefore can ever be exactly
reproduced.' It would be as sensible to say that
a legal education is of no good, because laws
are ever being altered (ought we to say mended?);
or a medical training, because no two
human constitutions are exactly alike. 'Men
are of like passions' with their forefathers, and
masses of men are moved by impulses similar
to those which stirred the men of old. So we
believe in 'History as the Teacher of Politics,'
and are glad indeed that our young politicians
at Cambridge have so learned, and faithful, and
courageous a guide. May they have the graces
to profit by their privileges, and give their countrymen
the benefit hereafter, and so disappoint
the somewhat disheartening forebodings of the
exordium of this discourse!</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>The Mutineers of the 'Bounty' and their Descendants
in Pitcairn and Norfolk Islands.</i>
By Lady <span class="smcap">Belcher</span>. John Murray.</p>

<p>Lady Belcher, having obtained possession of
a variety of private documents, and having
from private sources gathered a variety of details,
has, in this volume, told over again the
romantic story of the Pitcairn Islanders. Lady
Belcher herself is the step-daughter of Captain
Heywood, a midshipman of the 'Bounty' at
the time of the mutiny&mdash;she naturally, therefore,
feels a personal interest in the subject.
She is not very skilled in book-making; her
narrative is desultory and overlaid with documents;
but she has told the story with a fulness
of detail to which the volume of Sir John
Barrow, written for 'The Family Library'
thirty years ago, makes no pretension. The
diary of Morrison, a petty officer of the ship,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
gives for the first time the details of the voyage,
and of the tyrannous conduct of the commander
of the 'Bounty,' Lieutenant Bligh, prior to
the mutiny. Clearly, Fletcher Christian was
maddened by insults and overbearing tyranny.
Bligh's conduct indeed seems to have been that
of a madman rather than of a sane person. After
the mutiny the narrative divides itself into
three independent branches. First, a history
of Bligh and his companions, who were sent
adrift in the boat; next, of Christian and those
who remained in the 'Bounty,' some involuntarily,
having taken no part in the mutiny, simply
because the boat in which Bligh was sent
off could contain no more&mdash;among these was
Peter Heywood, the midshipman. This section
of the crew of the 'Bounty' landed at Tahiti,
and there gave themselves up to the captain of
the 'Pandora,' by whom they were treated with
great and unnecessary harshness. They were
put in irons, and sent to England for trial. The
'Pandora,' however, was wrecked upon a reef,
and after a hazardous boat voyage, they reached
Batavia, and were thence sent to England. Heywood
and Morrison were adjudged guilty, on
the formal ground of insufficient resistance to
Christian, but were instantly and honourably
pardoned; others were executed.</p>

<p>Christian and eight Englishmen, who remained
in the 'Bounty,' went to Pitcairn
Island, taking with them some Tahitian women,
and founded a colony there. After some
dissensions and violence, in which Christian,
Edward Young, and others, lost their lives, the
colony, under the rule and teaching of John
Adams, became singularly peaceful and virtuous.
They were not discovered for many
years; and were permitted to remain unmolested;
one or two adventurers joined them, and
the colony remains to this day. It outgrew
the small island, however, and a few years
since the entire population was transferred,
under the auspices of Sir William Dennison,
to Norfolk Island; a few of them returned,
and were last visited by Sir W. Dilke, who
gives an account of them in his 'Greater
Britain.'</p>

<p>No wonder that so romantic a narrative, and
so picturesque a community, fascinated the
muse of Byron, and elicited 'The Island' from
his pen.</p>

<p>Lady Belcher has told a plain unvarnished
tale, but it is one hardly to be paralleled in the
romance of the seas.</p>

Historical Selections from the best Authorities.</i>
By <span class="smcap">E. M. Sewell</span> and <span class="smcap">S. M. Yonge</span>.
Macmillan and Co.</p>

<p>This is the second volume of an attempt to
render history attractive and popular with
young readers, and there is much to be said in
its favour. The era of which it treats is from
1088 to 1228. The characters foremost on the
scene are Henry II., Frederick Barbarossa,
Richard I., Philip Augustus, John, St. Bernard
and Abelard, Becket, Longchamp, and Langton.
According to the design, we have a set
of pictures by hands of very unequal power.
Gibbon and Capefigue are side by side with
Milman and James, while from Mr. Stubbs's
masterly analysis of Henry II.'s character we
pass to a portrait of Longchamp by Lord
Campbell, and one of Langton by Dean Hook.
The result is rather like a mosaic, but of
course it could not well be otherwise. The
editorial introductions are admirably done;
the first, which describes the position and
character of our Angevin kings, is a sketch
both brilliant and accurate. The chief objection
to this method of teaching history is, that
writers of historical monographs are too apt to
become amorous of their theme, and to indulge
in much fine writing in consequence; and this
objection specially applies to Mr. Morrison's
account of St. Bernard, which is painfully verbose
and magniloquent. Undoubtedly the
best chapter in the book, and the one that will
most severely tax the young student's mental
energy, is that which contains Mr. Stubbs's
account of Henry II.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>On the Trail of the War.</i> By <span class="smcap">Alexander
James Shand</span>, Occasional Correspondent of
<i>The Times</i>. Smith, Elder and Co.</p>

<p>This little volume purports to be nothing
more than a full and true account of the ordinary
incidents in an extraordinary state of
things which occur on the trail of the war. To
this position the author strictly confines himself,
leaving the more stirring events of the
front to be described by others. Some of the
papers are reprints from <i>The Times</i>, but the
greater portion of them are original, and may
be supposed to be a veracious account of the
progress of the armies as beheld from the rear.
The author's departure from London is told
with a picturesque dash, which predisposes the
reader for the hacking, hewing, and slashing
he has subsequently to go through; while the
last chapter resumes the situation, as the
French say, in a warm outburst of dread, and
admiration of the strength of new-born Germany.
Mr. Shand evidently sees amid all this
ponderous power, the stumbling-block over
which she must one day totter and fall. To
the paramount passion of nationality from
which this gigantic Germany has been created,
will likewise be owing her quick decay and
sudden dissolution. This feeling makes the
wisest of Germans lose his head when speaking
of united Germany, and proclaim himself
proud to belong to God's chosen people. To
this we can only answer from our own personal
experience, that if the impatience created by
the restless variety and overweening self-laudation
of the French, are to be exchanged for
the cold pedantry and haughty arrogance of
the Prussians, Europe will have made but a
sorry bargain. We cannot agree with Mr.
Carlyle in his opinion that we may be greatly
benefited by this sudden transfer of moral
power from light satirical France to heavy overbearing
Prussia. We can only pray to be preserved
from both.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>The Revolt of the Protestants of the Cevennes;
with some Account of the Huguenots in the
Seventeenth Century.</i> By Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bray</span>,
Author of 'The Good St. Louis and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
Times,' 'The White Hoods,' &amp;c. John
Murray.</p>

<p>Of all the stirring romances hitherto published
by Mrs. Bray, the <i>true</i> history before
us is assuredly the most stirring and the most
romantic. The single story of Jean Cavalier,
the baker's boy of Anduze, contains the elements
of a dozen romances. From his first
appearance on the stage of history to do his
allotted work, to his final sinking into honourable
obscurity when his work was done, Jean
Cavalier shines out as the true and gallant soldier
of the cross, the faithful defender of the
right, the constant avenger of the wrong. He
was a youth of seventeen, the eldest of three
sons of a shepherd of Anduze. 'Altogether,'
says Mrs. Bray, 'he was such as we may fancy
him to have been, who, armed with the shepherd's
sling in the cause of the Lord, overcame
the giant Philistine.' None could have thought
that such a one could have been chosen to
avenge the iniquitous Edict of Nantes, issued
by the greatest monarch of Europe, at the instigation
of the wisest woman of her day.
The boy had been apprenticed to a baker at
Anduze, and this circumstance was in itself a
fund of amusement at the court of Versailles,
where the '<i>Petit Ma&icirc;tre</i>' and the '<i>Gar&ccedil;on
Boulanger</i>' served as whetstones to the wit
of the courtiers at the <i>petit lever</i> and <i>grand
coucher</i> of the king. But the baker's boy had
been endowed by heaven with the strangest
and most mysterious of gifts&mdash;a military genius
untaught, and frank as nature's self&mdash;which
ere long caused the boldest of the Great Monarch's
generals to tremble and turn pale at
even the mention of his name. No other account
of this extraordinary talent has been
given than that during his shepherd life he
would love to spend whole hours on the Garden
watching the man&oelig;uvres of the soldiers, who
at that time were stationed in the country in
order to force the Protestants into adoption of
the Catholic faith. No other lesson in military
science had he ever taken, and yet he defeated
the boldest troops and ablest generals of the
proudest army in the world! The mysterious
nature of his mission, reminds one strongly of
Joan of Arc. At nineteen years of age he
quitted France for ever, leaving behind him
the memory of his glory and the grateful affection
of the Protestants of the Cevennes, by
whom his name is revered and cherished to
this very day.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bray has performed her task of biographer
of Jean Cavalier in the most satisfactory
and conscientious manner, with all the stedfastness
of the historian and the enthusiasm
of the romance writer. 'The Revolt in the
Cevennes' is a charming book, and should be
placed in the hands of every Protestant boy
and girl throughout the world.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>The Correspondence of the Right Honourable
William Wickham, from the year</i> 1794.
Edited, with Notes, by his Grandson, <span class="smcap">William
Wickham</span>, M.A. Two vols. 8vo. London.
1870.</p>

<p>These volumes are another contribution to
the still increasing store of material for the history
of the great French Revolution; the first
act of that great drama of which another is
now being played amid sympathies and antipathies,
hopes and fears, perhaps as intense,
certainly more widely felt, than those which
accompanied the first lifting of the curtain.
Now, however, the Revolution and the <i>ancien
r&eacute;gime</i> have become accustomed to each other,
and know that though it be but as cat and dog,
they must awhile lead some sort of life together;
and they have modified their reciprocal
attitude accordingly. Then each startled by
the first apparition of the other, glared at it
with the hate, not of prolonged antagonism,
but of instant death-grapple. Free England,
guided by great and noble-minded men&mdash;Pitt,
Lord Grenville, and Burke&mdash;not only joined
in, but led the resistance of the Continental
sovereigns, and we have no need to blush for
the conduct of our grandsires. Whether, looking
from our present coign of vantage, we may
judge England's course then wise or imprudent,
the evidence afforded by these volumes
is enough to show&mdash;admitting the hostile prejudice
which an established and aristocratic
government must needs have against a mushroom
democracy&mdash;that our statesmen descended
to the fray with an honesty of purpose, and
an elevated sense of national duty on which
we may reflect with grateful and patriotic
pride.</p>

<p>Mr. Wickham was twice sent by Lord Grenville
as minister to Switzerland; to the comparatively
slight duties of which office was
added the onerous task of concerting, in correspondence
with the Royalists in France, with
the Prince of Cond&eacute;, the Court of Vienna,
Marshal Suwarrow, General Pichegru, and
many others, the measures to be taken against
their common foe&mdash;the Directory in Paris. At
the time of Mr. Wickham's earlier mission,
Bonaparte had not yet risen to power, and if
Mr. Wickham could have inspired with his
own zeal and prudence the selfish and blind
potentates whom he was aiding with English
counsel and treasure, the glittering series of
Napoleonic phenomena might never have appeared.
Mr. Wickham was regarded with the
most perfect confidence by his own Government.
How dangerous he proved to their foes
may be judged from the fact that when at a
later period he was named to represent his
country at the courts, first of Berlin and then
of Vienna, his appointment was objected to
because it would be displeasing to the French
Government.</p>

<p>By those who are either well acquainted
with, or are studying the history of the French
Revolution, these volumes will be highly prized,
while general readers will find much of great
interest in a correspondence which comprises
letters from George III., Louis XVIII., the
Prince de Cond&eacute;, and the Duc d'Enghien, the
Archduke Charles, Marshal Suwarrow, and
many others, besides the despatches and other
communications which passed between Mr.
Wickham and his chief, Lord Grenville. The
present Mr. Wickham has added succinct biographical
notes concerning the several correspondents
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
and persons named, some introductory
remarks to the several groups of despatches,
and a slight sketch of his grandfather's
career, written with grace and modest
pride. The first volume is embellished with a
portrait of the diplomatist; and the second
with a very interesting one of the most eccentric
of great men&mdash;Suwarrow.</p>

<p>Nearly all the letters now published relate
to Mr. Wickham's foreign missions. He afterwards
served as Secretary for Ireland, and
while he held that office Emmet's rebellion occurred.
He was also a member of the ministry
of 'All the Talents.' If he has left as interesting
memorials of his later services as of his
earlier ones, we hope that his grandson may at
a future time let his present good work be followed
by a publication of Mr. Wickham's later
correspondence.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>Cicero</i>. Select Letters. With English Introductions,
Notes, and Appendices. By <span class="smcap">Albert
Watson</span>, M. A. Macmillan and Co.
Clarendon Press Series.</p>

<p>The letters of Cicero, on account of the materials
they supply for the history of the Roman
constitution during its last struggles, the
light they throw upon the motives and movements
of the partisan leaders, and the insight
they afford into the character of Cicero himself,
are justly regarded as the most important and
instructive of his literary productions. Cicero's
correspondence extends over the space of twenty-six
years; and of the letters written during
this eventful period to a wide circle of literary
and political friends and connexions, there are
extant upwards of 850, which are undoubtedly
genuine. Up to the present time, this portion
of Cicero's writings has received but little attention
at the hands of English editors. In
Germany, excellent editions have been published
by Billerbeck, Boot, Frey, Hofman, and
S&uuml;ple; while in England we have only an inferior
edition of the letters to Atticus by a
Master of Arts, and a selection of 111 letters
by E. St. John Parry, intended to illustrate the
public life of Cicero, accompanied with notes
which are purely historical. The volume before
us is also a selection of 148 letters, taken
almost exclusively out of the two chief divisions
of Cicero's correspondence&mdash;the <i>Epistol&aelig; ad
Familiares, those ad Diversos</i>, and the <i>Epistol&aelig;
ad Atticum</i>&mdash;containing together 822 letters.
The first letter in this volume is dated July 65
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and the last July 43 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> The collection,
therefore, covers one of the most momentous
periods in Roman history. Mr. Watson, in
making the present selection of letters, has
been principally guided by considerations of
their historical importance, or of their value as
illustrating Cicero's character. The collection
is divided into parts or groups, each of which
is preceded by a lengthy and valuable introduction,
furnishing the reader with a digest of
the leading public events, and a review of the
state of political parties during each period.
In this portion of the work, the editor has borrowed
largely from the well-known 'History
of Rome,' by Professor Mommsen, and from
Br&uuml;ckner's 'Life of Cicero.' The works of
Zumpt, Drumann, Abeken, and Reen, have also
been laid under heavy contributions. In
the appendices to those sections, the reader
will find discussed with clearness and ability
many legal and historical questions, highly important
for the right understanding of allusions
in the letters&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, the legal question at issue
between C&aelig;sar and the Senate, the Calendar,
the meaning of the terms 'colonia,' 'municipium,'
and 'pr&aelig;fectura,' &amp;c. These introductions
and appendices add greatly to the value
of the volume. The notes are far more numerous,
but not so learned and valuable as those
of the German editions. Indeed, many are so
brief and unimportant that it is difficult to account
for their insertion, and seem quite out
of place in a work which is evidently not intended
for tyros. The only persons qualified
to read the letters of Cicero are the highest
classes in schools, and students at the Universities,
neither of which stand in need of a
translation of passages and of words that involve
no particular difficulty. The following
are taken <i>ad apertram libri</i>:&mdash;<span class="greek" title="hysteron proteron">&#8021;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#972;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;
</span>,
'I will answer your last question first;'
<span class="greek" title="Hom&ecirc;rik&ocirc;s">&#8009;&#956;&#951;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#8182;&#962;
</span> 'after the manner of Homer;' contiones,
'addresses to the populace;' manum,
'crew;' in eo ... erant omnia, 'on that
everything depended;' inopiam, 'the neediness;'
judicium, 'the trial.' Most of the notes
are, in our opinion, too elementary for qualified
readers of the correspondence of Cicero. The
abundant references to Madvig's Grammar will
be found exceedingly useful. On the whole,
it is an excellent edition, and cannot be perused
without greatly enlarging one's knowledge
and deepening one's interest in these unique
epistolary writings.</p>

<p>Another successful attempt to rescue a great
historical reputation from the slanders of the
scurrilous pamphleteers of the Restoration, and
one of which it is no mean praise to say, that
it is not unworthy of a place beside Mr. Markham's
recently published noble vindications of
Fairfax. The 'Goodman Button (a hoyman of
Ipswich), his boy' of the 'Mystery of the Good
Old Cause,' which would seem to have been the
source from whence Bates, Winstanley, Heath,
and the author of the 'Lives of the King-killers,'
as well as Clarendon, drew their inspiration,
turns out to have been the son of a
Gloucestershire gentleman, who was connected
both by birth and by marriage with such families
as the Wickhams, the Hampdens, and the
Mildmays; and the 'Hoyman of Ipswich' to
have been a captain in the King's service, who
was attached to the Royal Dockyard, at Harwich,
and was a kinsman of Sir Thomas Button's,
a near relative of the St. Johns and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
Cromwells. Mr. Deane having been fortunate
enough to discover a copy of the elaborate and
elegant Latin inscription which was composed
for the tablet erected to the memory of his
illustrious ancestor in Westminster Abbey,
among the additional MSS. in the British Museum,
has been directed by it to the entry of
his baptism in the register of the parish of
Lower Guyting, near Winchcombe. It is as
follows: 'Anno Dni. 1610, ye viii daie of Julie,
was baptized Richard Deane, ye sonne of Edward
Deane.' His mother was a Warre, and
his grandmother a Wickham, through whom he
was connected with the Hampdens and the
Cromwells; and his aunt Joan seems to have
married Robert Mildmay, of Terling, the grandson
of Sir Thomas Mildmay, one of the auditors
of the Court of Augmentation in the reign
of Henry VIII., and grand-nephew of Sir
Walter Mildmay, the founder of Emmanuel
College, Cambridge. We have no knowledge
of Deane's career up to the year 1642, beyond
the fact of his having served under Captain
Button, of Harwich, during some part of that
period; nor have we any of his private life at
all, except that he married Mary Grimsditch,
and that at his death he left two daughters by
her, Mary and Hannah, the former of whom
died unmarried, and the latter married Goodwin
Swift, attorney-general of Tipperary, and
uncle to the well-known Dean of St. Patrick's,
Jonathan Swift. From the year 1642 to that
of his death, however, few names are more
frequently mentioned in the annals of his day
than that of Richard Deane. He early and
heartily espoused the cause of the Parliament
in the great civil war, under a conviction that
in no other way could the religion and the
liberties of the country be saved; and soon
proved himself to be 'one of those extraordinary
men, produced by revolutionary times, who by
the innate force of an energetic character, surmount
the difficulties of birth and station, and,
rising to authority, seem as if they had been
born and educated for it; no one wondering
either at their elevation, or at the ease with
which they discharge the duties of the highest
offices.' His biographer has related his great
services to the cause which he espoused with
singular impartiality, which renders his work a
valuable contribution to the general history of
his times. After the trial and execution of the
King, in which, as is well known, Deane took
a very prominent part, he was appointed, 'in
connection with Colonels Edward Popham and
Robert Blake, as one of the three generals at
sea,' with 'co-ordinate powers.' In 1651, he
assumed the chief command in Scotland, where
he was the principal means of bringing about
the 'eight years' tranquillity' which Bishop
Barnet 'so commends and attributes to the
(happy) usurpation.' War now breaking out
with the Dutch, Deane was hastily summoned to
rejoin the fleet. It was in action with the Dutch
that he met with his death, June 2, 1653. 'He
fell at the moment of victory, sword in hand,
in the bow of his ship, as he was waving his
sword and encouraging his men to follow him
in boarding 'the Dutch Admiral,' Van Tromp.
Deane was buried with all honour in the chapel
of Henry VII., at Westminster Abbey, on the
24th of February following. 'The corpse,' the
authors of the 'Parliamentary History of England'
inform us, 'was brought from Greenwich
to Westminster Bridge by water, attended by
thirty barges in mourning. The procession was
saluted in their passage by all the ships in the
river, and the Tower guns. In the evening, the
body was interred in the Abbey with great
pomp; the lord-general and his council, with
all the officers of the navy and army then in
town, attending the funeral.' After the Restoration,
his body, together with those of twenty
others of his contemporaries, was removed and
re-interred in the adjoining churchyard. The
sympathies of his biographer may be inferred
from the following comments on this act of
Charles II. and his advisers. 'If their bodies
had been decently removed from the church to
the churchyard, no blame can justly attach to
the King for the removal, for he naturally desired
to clear his own family vaults of those
whom he might undoubtedly regard as intruders.
But it is not quite so certain that the
removal and re-interment were so decorously
conducted as tradition says they were. The
present Dean of Westminster, with the laudable
desire of ascertaining not only the place, but
also the manner of re-burial, caused, in November,
1869, the ground to be opened on the spot
supposed to be the grave of the removed, but
found no evidence of a decent and careful interment,
such as fragments of coffins, and
skeletons lying side by side in the order of deposit,
but only a confused mass of bones, so
mixed together as to suggest an irreverent
emptying of coffins into a large common pit.
The Dean, and other members of the Chapter
who accompanied him, went away, and still remain
in the charitable hope that they have
failed in discovering the deposit which they
sought, but have fallen in with some other not
unusual spectacle in crowded churchyards,
where the callous sexton of one generation
shovels away the coffinless bones of the preceding,
to make room for the bodies of his
own contemporaries who may have occasion
for his services. It is earnestly to be hoped
that such was the case here, and that the only
indignity to which Richard Deane and Robert
Blake were exposed, was the removal of their
remains from the burial place of kings to that
of ordinary Christians, with no other memorial
of their names than that of their deathless renown.
Be the case as it may, these facts are
certain, they fought on the same deck, died in
the same cause, and were buried in the same
pit. They had been loving and pleasant in
their lives, and in their graves they were not
divided.' We congratulate Mr. Deane on the
ability, the fairness, and the diligence which
he has brought to his praiseworthy undertaking.
He has rendered the historical student admirable
service.</p>

<p>Our literary and ecclesiastical authorities are
much occupied at present with the life-work
and surroundings of John Wesley, with his relation
to the Church of England, and with the
probable position that would have been assigned
to an ecclesiastical reformer, or revivalist,
occupying in the Church of Rome a position
analogous to that of John Wesley in the English
Church. We do not endorse the big words
with which Mr. Tyerman opens up his subject.
'Is it not a truth (he asks) that Methodism is
the greatest fact in the history of the Church
of Christ? Methodism has now existed one
hundred and thirty years. Is there any other
system that has spread itself as widely in an
equal period? We doubt it.' Whether the
victories of Methodism over other ecclesiastical
organizations, or over religious indifferentism, or
over the stubborn resistance to God's truth of
the barbarian or the idolater, can be paralleled
with the past successes of the Apostolic Church
or not, and whether numbers or area can now
be used as measures of greatness, may be considered
open questions, but no ecclesiastical
writer pretending to honour truth or candour
can hide his eye to the fact of Methodism, or to
the vitality it displays at the present moment.
We are thankful for this instalment of Mr.
Tyerman's valuable work. There is a mine of
wealth, a store-house of treasure, in the unimpeachable
diary and authentic correspondence
contained in this first volume, which will amply
repay most careful attention.</p>

<p>Miss Julia Wedgewood, in our opinion, has
done very excellent service. She has not attempted
to write a memoir of John Wesley or
his brother, or a history of Methodism, nor has
she kept up a chronological continuity in her
fascinating pages, but she has shown us the
remarkable figure of Wesley upon a great variety
of backgrounds. Methodism at Oxford,
with its first obstacles in the painfully exacting
conscience and scrupulosity of Wesley himself,
becomes a vivid sketch of Oxford life at the
commencement of the eighteenth century.
Methodism in Virginia becomes an impressive
representation of the relation of England to her
colonies. The conflict of Methodism with
Bristol and Cornwallese colliers; its hand to
hand fight with the devils of hysteria and fear,
and with those of bigotry and exclusiveness;
with Moravian theology, and with Calvinism
and its old problem of the universe, are all well
told in a succession of bright and thoughtfully
conceived pictures. There is very remarkable
candour, much good sense, and wise use of
material in her work; and the volume will
bring the high enthusiasm and glorious
earnestness of Wesley into contact with classes
that would remain strangers to the more elaborate
biographical details of Mr. Tyerman. The
subject is so large&mdash;so important in all its
bearings&mdash;that we cannot dismiss these works
with a cursory notice; we shall hope, at an
early date, to return to the literature and
ecclesiastical position of the Wesleys.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>Memorials of the late Rev. William M. Bunting;
being Selections from his Sermons,
Letters, and Poems.</i> Edited by the Rev. <span class="smcap">G.
Stringer Rowe</span>. With a Biographical Introduction
by <span class="smcap">Thomas Percival Bunting</span>.
Wesleyan Conference Office.</p>

<p>The characteristic of William Bunting which
all who knew him would assuredly mention
first was an unbounded power of loving; and
as the effect of this as near an embodiment of
the 'charity' of the Epistle to the Corinthians
as is perhaps possible to men who love truth
and the God of truth. 'Grace to all them that
love the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity,' was
not only a sentiment upon his lips, it was an
instinctive, irrepressible feeling of his heart.
Few men were more attached to his own Church;
few men had more large-hearted and loving appreciation
of the good men and good things of
all other Churches. Charity was the 'bond of
his perfectness.' Wherever Christ was to be
served, the souls of men benefited, faithful
preachers to be heard, fervent worship to be
joined in, there, according to his opportunity,
William Bunting was to be found. Our cathedrals
were familiar with his tall, attenuated,
intellectual figure. In any Nonconformist congregation
in London, where worship and preaching
were edifying, he was at any time as likely
to be found as in a Wesleyan Chapel. Few of
the principal Nonconformist pulpits were unfamiliar
with his ministrations. His friends
were the best ministers of every evangelical
church. He was a lover of all good men, and
all good men loved him. He was a kind of
<i>tertium quid</i>, around which the best men and
feelings of the different sects crystallized into
beautiful forms of charity. No one thought of
him as belonging to any one section of the
Church; the feeling towards him was that he
belonged to all. This volume of memorials will
be valued by his friends. The brief biographical
sketch by his brother is sufficient for the
record of his uneventful life; it is racy and piquant
in its style, yet fervent and tender in its
love and devout sympathy.</p>

<p>As a preacher, Mr. Bunting was diffuse and
therefore lengthy, and sometimes tedious, although
his brother testifies to his great efficiency.</p>

<p>As a letter-writer he was wonderfully
loquacious; some of his letters, as he says,
'as long as a life,' even as abbreviated here,
filling eight or ten pages of print. Rarely
could he have said with Paul, 'I have written
a letter unto you in few words:' but they are
wonderfully loving, enthusiastic and brilliant,
full of delicate sympathy and beautiful piety
and charity.</p>

<p>Chiefly, however, Mr. Bunting excelled as a
writer of hymns. Two or three of his compositions
have found their way into popular
hymnals, and are not likely to be forgotten.

<p class="hang p2"><i>The Life of Arthur Tappan.</i> With Preface
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
by the Rev. <span class="smcap">Newman Hall</span>, LL.D. Sampson
Low and Co.</p>

<p>Mr. Tappan was a New York merchant, of
a type which the <i>laudator temporis acti</i> would
tell us was once not uncommon, but is now
rarely to be met with either in America or
England. This we are loth to believe. There
are still, thank God, not a few upright, God-fearing,
noble-hearted men, who will do and
dare whatever righteousness and religion may
demand. Mr. Tappan was eminently one who
'feared God and eschewed evil,' whose business
was as much a religion to him as church-worship.
His one simple maxim was to do
right at any cost. He is said to have been
the first man in America 'to make use of
money in large sums for benevolent objects.'
Certainly he was generous, to the verge of
prudence; and when reverses came upon him
he did not begin retrenchment with the things
of God. His high-toned morality did not always
square with the morals of Wall-street,
and often involved him in perplexing and ludicrous
entanglements; but nothing could shake
his determination to do right. Several business
friends wished to help him in his pecuniary
difficulties, but urged upon him as a tacit
condition the desirableness of lessening his
anti-slavery denunciations. His short and decisive
answer was, 'I will be hung first.' He
was the prime mover and leader of many
things, greatest and best, in the religious life
of America. He was president of the Anti-Slavery
Society, and one of the founders of
the Bible Society, the Tract Society, Oberlin
College, and the American Education Society&mdash;to
all of which he gave large pecuniary and
laborious personal assistance. He was a kind
of American John Thornton in his religious
philanthropy. He fought many a fierce and
fearless battle, especially in the anti-slavery
cause&mdash;when to be its advocate was to imperil
life. He was mobbed, and had a price set upon
his head. A more beautiful, single-hearted,
noble life of integrity, industry, fearlessness,
and generosity has rarely been lived.
His closing days at Newhaven have an interesting
setting of New England Puritanism,
and were quiet, devout, and beautiful. In a
higher sense than mere amassing of money he
was a 'successful merchant.' Our merchants
will do well to read this interesting memoir,
and to learn anew from it the old lesson that
'the fear of the Lord is, indeed, the beginning
of wisdom.'</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>Journeys in North China, Manchuria, and
Eastern Mongolia; with some Account of
Corea.</i> By the Rev. <span class="smcap">Alexander Williamson</span>,
B.A., Agent of the National Bible Society
of Scotland. With Illustrations and 2
Maps. Two vols. Smith, Elder and Co.</p>

<p>Mr. Williamson has contributed to the literature
of travel and of science another of those
thorough, sober, and instructive books which
have been one of the incidental results of
Christian Missions. To the ordinary advantages
over casual visitors, which long residence
and familiar intimacy gives to a missionary,
and to the conscientiousness which his religious
position and character impose upon him,
Mr. Williamson, as a highly-educated medical
man, adds a higher degree of scientific
knowledge than many of his brethren possess,
which qualifies him to speak of the
configuration, products, and possibilities of
the country in a way that will impart valuable
knowledge. Mr. Williamson first visited China
as a missionary in connection with the London
Missionary Society. His health failed after
two or three years' residence, and he returned
to England. On the re-establishment of his
health he returned to China, about seven years
ago, as an agent of the National Bible Society
of Scotland. These volumes are, virtually,
the journal-records of eight extensive journeys
through various parts of North China, which
he has made in the prosecution of his evangelistic
labours. It need scarcely be remarked
that a man so occupied, the very business of
whose life is to travel from place to place, and
to cultivate familiar intercourse with the people,
has opportunities for the acquisition of
knowledge, to which no mere casual traveller,
or resident merchant, or professional man can
pretend. Accordingly, Mr. Williamson's volumes
are full of minute, thorough, and novel
information of all kinds concerning the country
and the people; they are utilitarian enough
for a blue book, while they have the general interest
of a book of travels in countries of which
we are almost entirely ignorant. We do not,
in fact, remember two volumes the information
of which is so valuable, and the interest
of which is so great, at this particular juncture
especially, when our peaceful relations
with China are again in peril. Our Government,
as well as the general public, may gather
from them more accurate and extensive
information respecting the sources and character
of Chinese feeling towards us, than from
any other source whatever&mdash;not excepting even
the valuable and intelligent information furnished
by our diplomatic agents. Mr. Williamson
has been among the people as distinguished
from officials, and he speaks confidently
concerning the peacefulness and friendliness
of their disposition towards Protestant missionaries.
He travelled unarmed, and encountered
no violence or rudeness, nothing
more than the occasional attempts at extortion
with which travellers are not unfamiliar in
London and New York. They are grossly
ignorant, and in some places look upon Europeans
as a different species of beings. 'In
some places they calls us "devils," not in impertinence,
but in genuine ignorance of our
origin and character; so much so, that they
often use this term with complimentary prefixes,
as <i>e.g.</i>, their practice of calling a friend
of ours Kwhe tze ta jen, "His Excellency the
Devil." Moreover, they often use this term in
our courts of justice. In other places they
look upon us as a race of fierce men not quite
up to the mark in mental powers. Many a
time have foreigners been provoked by Chinamen
coming up to them, patting them on the
shoulder, and caressing them just as we
would a huge Newfoundland dog, or a semi-tamed
lion. Nor is this all. They appear in many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
districts to look upon us as a species of fools.
Often have I observed Chinamen address myself
and others just as mendacious nursery-maids
address children, as if we were incapable
of seeing through their barefaced lies and
shallow deceit.' The Imperial claim is as
preposterous as ever&mdash;as shown by the refusal
to receive Prince Alfred&mdash;and is a serious obstacle
in national intercourse. Lord Elgin
attempted effectually to destroy this by a
march on Peking, which was baffled by the
flight of the Emperor to Tartary. The Chinese
people sadly lack truth, uprightness, and
honour, the fear of God. The opium trade,
which has been our great disgrace, and which
has, it is feared, extended beyond all legislative
or diplomatic control, is the deadly curse of
the country. 'There are literally millions,'
says Mr. Williamson, 'to whom opium is more
valuable than life. The only hope is the creation
of a public opinion against it among those
who abstain from the poison, and among the
young; so that the generation of opium smokers
may, in due course, die out. The reformation
has already commenced, and only needs
to be fostered and systematized.'</p>

<p>The Roman Catholics are much disliked by
the Chinese, chiefly because of the outrages
committed by the French soldiers during the
late war&mdash;the fatal blunder into which our
neighbours always fall in their dealings with
weaker nations, or in their attempts to colonize:
wherever they go, they invariably succeed
in getting themselves well hated. Another
cause of dislike to the Roman Catholics is the
assumptions of the priests, and their arbitrary
claims to property. 'There is no hostility on
the part of the people towards Protestant missionaries.'
And Mr. Williamson thinks that
'were the matter of inland residence made a
provision in treaty engagements, there would
be little or no difficulty in carrying it out.'
The hostility of the mandarins during the last
year or two, the Tien-tsin massacres, and other
indications of dislike in the governing classes,
are attributed by Mr. Williamson to 'the ultra-liberal
policy of our Government, and especially
to that outburst of hostile criticism in
the spring of 1869, on the part of our officials
and leading politicians and writers at home, all
of which was duly communicated to the Chinese
authorities, leading them to believe either
that we were sure of our strength, or had lost
all interest in our countrymen in China.' Mr.
Williamson lays great stress on a demand being
made for 'inland residence under proper
sanction;' and he argues this from the perfect
success of the experiment, so far as it has been
made. 'Protestant missionaries, British, German,
and American, have been labouring unmolested
for some years, in many of their inland
cities.' The Chinese opponents of missionaries
are not the people, but corrupt officials,
who oppose everything foreign and everything
calculated to enlighten or improve the moral
tone of the people. Mr. Williamson's reply to
such diplomats and writers as denounce the
missionaries in China, or sneer at them, is not
only conclusive, it is perfectly crushing. Five
powerful foreign legations have for several
years resided in Pekin, viz., the British,
American, French, Russian, and Prussian.
They had very able men and very great facilities.
Not long ago, the head of the British Legation
thought fit to taunt the missionaries, by
urging them to begin by converting the higher
classes, adding that 'China would be raised
through them, not in spite of them.' Mr. Williamson
pertinently asks, what with all their
ability and opportunities they have done, and
unhesitatingly answers, nothing! All the European
books, lesson books, and books of
science especially, which it is no part of the
missionary's function to produce, have been
compiled or translated by them. 'Dr. Hobson
has given them works on Physiology; on the
Principles and Practice of Surgery; on the
Practice of Medicine and Materia Medica; on
the Diseases of Children; on the Elements of
Chemistry and Natural Philosophy. Mr. Wylie
has given them the whole of <i>Euclid</i>; De Morgan's
<i>Algebra</i>, in thirteen books; Loomis'
<i>Analytical Geometry and Differential and
Integral Calculus</i>, in eighteen books, and also
the first part of Newton's <i>Principia</i> which is
now in process of completion. Mr. Edkins
has translated Whewell's <i>Mechanics</i>, and given
them many other contributions on science and
Western literature. Mr. Muirhead has produced
a work on English history, and another
on universal geography. Dr. Bridgman has
published a finely illustrated work on the United
States of America. Dr. W. P. Martin has
translated Wheaton's <i>International Law</i>, and
just published an elaborately illustrated work
in three large volumes, on Chemistry and Natural
Philosophy. Other missionaries have
given them works on Electro-telegraphy, Botany,
and elementary treatises on almost every
subject of Western science.' Would it not be
as well for some of these diplomatic gentlemen
to employ their abundant leisure in emulating,
rather than in sneering at the earnest philanthropy
of these hard-working missionaries.
Until they can show something like such a list
of contributions to Chinese enlightenment,
shame should keep them silent, even if they
are incapable of generous appreciation.</p>

<p>These matters, however, are only touched in
the introductory part of Mr. Williamson's
book, which is an intelligent traveller's account
of China and the Chinese. It is full of matter
for quotation; but for this we have no space.
At one of the temples in Manchuria, Mr. Williamson
saw an instrument, which was the famous
praying machine. 'Prayers are pasted both
on the inside and outside of the barrels, which
being turned round, their prayers are presented,
as they suppose, to their god.' Some curious
church music was aided by 'two trumpets,
each of which was about twelve feet long,
with a mouth two feet in diameter; they were
mounted on small wheel-carriages, like guns,
and the players reclined upon the ground
when playing.' This was in the famous Temple
of Do-la-nor. At one place the landlord,
having no clock, fastened a huge fat cock under
Mr. Williamson's bed, lest he should oversleep
himself. We will add only, that the
book is written in a plain, business-like style,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
that it is full of valuable facts, that, in appendices,
Mr. Edkins and others have contributed
valuable papers, and that, in our judgment, it
is one of the most sterling and instructive, as
it is one of the most modest books of travels
that has appeared for years.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>Westward by Rail: the New Route to the East.</i>
By <span class="smcap">W. F. Rae</span>. Longmans, Green and Co.</p>

<p>The temptations to fulsome eulogy or to exaggerated
caricature are, to a writer of a book
of American travels, so great and are so rarely
resisted, that Mr. Rae, as a signal exception,
deserves the very highest praise. His feeling
to America and Americans is evidently of the
kindest, and yet he has had such a wholesome
fear of fulsome praise, that he has put himself
under almost undue restraint&mdash;the greys predominate
in his colouring. He has everywhere
manifestly endeavoured to see things as
they are and to describe them as he saw them;
the result is a sober, judicious, intelligent
book, that vouches for its own trustworthiness.
Mr. Rae describes only the route across the
American continent from New York to San
Francisco by the Great Pacific Railway. He
tells us that the basis of his book is two series of
letters which appeared in the <i>Daily News</i>, revised
and recast. He writes in an easy, accustomed
style, as men write whose pen is the
weapon with which they fight the battle of
life. He has imagination enough and descriptive
power enough to redeem his narrative
from the dryness of a log, and he has sufficiently
large and varied knowledge of the
world to qualify him to form wise, practical,
and genial estimates of things. Much in
American life is novel and experimental, and
demands in its judge no small power of constructive
imagination. Much in American feeling
is provincial, wayward, and almost morbidly
sensitive, and needs great candour for
the appreciation of its fresh, generous, and noble
elements. The Americans are rapidly outgrowing
some of the follies of their youth;
there are still in the practical administration of
politics and social economies many things&mdash;worse
than follies&mdash;that belie the noble principles
of their constitution, and that the warmest
friends of America cannot but look upon with
anxiety. The extent of administrative corruption,
the unscrupulousness of party politics,
not only as towards each other but as towards
other nations&mdash;such passionate, undignified,
and manifestly venal messages as the one just
sent to Congress by President Grant for instance,
with the political interpretations of
which it is susceptible&mdash;render it a question of
great solicitude whether these are the moral
weaknesses of childhood, which experience
and discipline will cure, so as to develope a
nation high and courteous in political as in social
and personal honour, or whether its political
maturity will manifest the faithlessness and
unscrupulousness which so sadly stain the
escutcheons of some European nations, and
which necessitate a constant and suspicious
vigilance; we strongly hope in the higher developement,
but the centenary of the nation's
birth is near at hand, and we are longing to
see a high-minded government and policy such
as we do not see yet.</p>

<p>Mr. Rae describes with smartness, the railways
and cars and travelling ways of America
as they have often been described. He especially
commends to our own greater railway
companies the luxury of Pullman's sleeping
cars, and we heartily endorse the recommendation.
It is no small luxury to be able to go to bed
while traveling at the rate of thirty miles an
hour in America&mdash;of from forty to fifty here&mdash;those
who cannot sleep may at any rate enjoy
a sprawl with disencumbered limbs. We
would also add a recommendation of the check
system with luggage; what should prevent our
companies giving passengers a check, to which
a corresponding number is affixed to the piece
of luggage, so that the latter might be delivered
to the porter or a servant presenting the
check? The comfort of being delivered from
all anxiety about luggage is a great luxury of
American travel. Mr. Rae describes Chicago
'the Garden City,' 'the Queen of the West,'
'the Queen of the Lakes,' as it is proudly
called. Forty years ago it was a log fort, to-day
300,000 well-to-do people, many of them
as wealthy merchants as any in the States, occupy
in palatial residences one of their most
imposing cities. Mr. Rae's account of the
Mormons is not very eulogistic, and is we suspect
much nearer the truth than most of the
superficial accounts, the result of an hour's
conversation, note-book in hand, that have
reached us. Brigham Young's peculiar institution
does not commend itself even on utilitarian
grounds: the intolerance, jealousy and
violence of the Mormon city, restrained only by
the adjacent United States' camp, must make
it an unenviable residence: while even the
vaunted industry of the residents is seriously
qualified in Mr. Rae's estimate of what has
been done in relation to the condition of the
place. We commend Mr. Rae's careful study
of Mormondom to all who have been fascinated
by the glamour of writers like Mr. Dixon.
Mr. Rae has much to say concerning California,
the enterprise of the people and their great future;
but he gives special emphasis to their
ultra-provincialism, and what surprises us
more, implies a slighting estimate of their hospitality.
Of their literature he speaks in
glowing terms&mdash;indeed he seems to think the
provincial press of the States superior to the
New York press. Mr. Rae's book is restricted
to the route which he travelled, and to matters
connected with it; it is therefore limited in its
range. He has also a slight tendency to
preach, but, as a whole, his book may be
very highly commended as an honest and successful
attempt to represent Brother Jonathan
as he really is.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>A Voyage round the World.</i> By the Marquis
de <span class="smcap">Beauvoir</span>. In Two vols. John Murray,
Albemarle-street. 1870.</p>

<p>These charming volumes come before us with
every claim to interest. The author is a Frenchman
without national prejudice&mdash;a mere boy

nobleman of high degree without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
<i>morgue</i> or arrogance, to whom fortune has allotted
an inestimable opportunity of improving
the gifts of nature by sending him as companion
to the young Duc de Penthi&egrave;vre, on this
easy, pleasant 'Voyage round the World.' All
these conditions unite to predispose the reader
to a series of novel emotions in traversing an
already beaten track. The Duc de Penthi&egrave;vre
is introduced to us as a young man of high intelligence
and sterling character, who, in spite
of his youth, had already seen six years of
service in the United States' navy, and gained
promotion therein by merit alone&mdash;not as
homage to his position as scion of a royal
house. The princes of the House of Orleans
have been apt scholars in the great school of
adversity. It would be well for France if the
lessons they have been learning could be turned
to account in the government of their own
country. We learn from M. de Beauvoir's
preface that, during the space of three months,
three princes of Orleans left Europe to see if in
some distant land they might not utilize their
talents and energy, as at present they were
unable to devote them to the service of their
own. The Duc d'Alen&ccedil;on entered the Spanish
service, and took command of the artillery during
the glorious expedition to the Philippine
Islands; the Prince de Cond&eacute; went to India
and Australia, where death cut him off at the
commencement of his career; and the Duc de
Penthi&egrave;vre, the Prince de Joinville's son,
started on a voyage round the world. No
greater proof of the great change which has
come over the social world of France could be
found than this announcement made so simply
by our author.</p>

<p>The two volumes under review are devoted
to Australia, Java, Siam, and Canton. The
novel judgments of men and things, attributable
to the extreme youth and exceptional position
of the writer, gives an entirely original
insight into the manners and customs of the
higher classes of these different countries. Naturally
enough, we turn at once to Australia.
Throughout the whole of the volume which
treats of Australia, the national pride of the
English reader is gratified to its fullest extent,
not by empty praise of material wealth and
rich produce, but by solid admiration of the
perseverance, tenacity of purpose, and high
intelligence with which the mother country
has resisted all temptation to impose a yoke
upon her distant children; and has thereby
caused their hearts to cling closer to her own,
than those of her nearer and dearer progeny.
We can readily sympathise with the pleased
astonishment which seizes upon the Marquis
de Beauvoir, when he contrasts the wise abstention
from all interference in the local government
of the colony, with the petty and vexatious
pressure of French authority in Algeria.</p>

<p>One instance of the equity of the law as
practised in the colony, contrasted with the
following of its mere letter, peculiar to the
tribunals of Europe, we cannot pass over.</p>

<p>'In going through the workshops we remarked
two native blacks, mere children, and
utterly hideous, but with a perfectly gentle
expression. Their extremely white teeth exposed
to view by a mouth split from ear to
ear, formed a strong contrast with their black
skins, as their jolly and perpetual laugh did
with the dress which is worn by those condemned
to hard labour for life. Their appearance
was so cheerful, that we were naturally
much interested in them. Besides, there was
a great deal in their novelty as aborigines.'
All interest in these merry culprits was, however,
at an end, when the visitors were informed
that one of them had murdered three sailors,
and the other had waylaid and hacked to
pieces two white women. They had not been
condemned to death, because 'they were natives&mdash;and
none of the aborigines had as yet been
hung&mdash;their instincts and belief being so different,
that with them murder is no crime; they
are tamed more by gentleness than cruelty.'</p>

<p>The Marquis expatiates, with true youthful
ardour, upon this generous forbearance, and
declares that a government professing such
principles after invading, in the name of civilization,
a country occupied by a barbarian race,
deserves the admiration of all Europe. The
records of Sydney law confirm the distinction
made between barbarous native and civilized
colonist; for a little while after, seven white
men, having murdered a family of natives,
were hung without mercy, to give a good example
to the rising generation of the young
colony, who are taught to pity the blind, ferocious
instincts of the native race, and to feel
contempt and horror of the civilized white men
guilty of the same cold-blooded atrocities.</p>

<p>Life in the bush has charms for our youthful
author as great as those of the handsome
drawing-rooms of Melbourne and Sydney.
After much visiting amongst the highest circles
of Sydney&mdash;banqueting at the Government
House, and dancing in the spacious halls of
the great officials of the colony&mdash;the buoyant
spirits of the young Marquis lead him to throw
himself, <i>a corps perdu</i>, into the delights of
savage life. His enthusiastic description of
the visit to Mr. Capel&mdash;the arrival of the party
at the hut inhabited by the triple millionaire,
on the banks of the Murray river&mdash;the glee
with which he recounts the danger of fording
the stream, while the horses were left to swim
to the bank as best they could, and the subsequent
scramble up the muddy side to Mr.
Capel's dwelling, will make many an English
boy's eyes sparkle with delight and envy as he
reads.</p>

<p>We can only mention the journey through
Java, Siam, and Canton. Much of the interest
lies in the description of the court of the King
of Siam, rendered familiar to the English public
by the recent account of the 'English Governess.'
At Hong Kong, the author's admiration
of English rule again breaks forth. And
we take our leave of the distinguished party,
of which he appears to have been the very life
and soul, with hearty thanks for the boldness
with which the young Marquis has dared to
assert his conviction that the English alone are
fitted to found a colony, and that no other
nation is possessed of the patience, the calmness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
and true sense of justice which are needed
to render the natives submissive to civilization
and the yoke of the foreigner.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>Fair France.</i> By the Author of 'John Halifax,
Gentleman.' Hurst and Blackett.</p>

<p>At a time when France is torn and tortured
by the most terrible war the world has ever
known, it seems strange to open a volume of
peaceful travel in the beautiful country which
most of us know so well, and which has undergone
such an unparalleled transformation.
The authoress (<i>pace</i> Thackeray) of this charming
volume is well known to the public as a
novelist, and however critical judgments may
vary as to her artistic power, of her purity of
tone and freedom from the vicious tendencies
of modern fictitious literature, there can be no
question. For our own part, we find her even
more agreeable as a tourist than as a novelist.
She looks at the world with unprejudiced
eyes; she finds that even French <i>cur&eacute;s</i> are
human beings, and not the frightful demons
that they appear to the excited imagination of
the honourable member for Peterborough.
We have, in these days, been accustomed to
travellers of many kinds: there is the sensational
tourist, who bursts into mysterious eloquence
on the slightest provocation; and there
is the cynical tourist, who with upturned nose
regards all the world as a gigantic imposture&mdash;looking
up into the dome of St. Peter's, or
down into the crater of Etna, and contemptuously
remarking that 'there is nothing in it.'
But the truly pleasant traveller is the man or
woman who starts with intent to enjoy the
trip, who looks at the bright side of everything,
and who, writing a book, writes cheerily
and gaily. This is precisely what we find
in 'Fair France.' The dedication deserves
to be quoted: 'I inscribe "Fair France"&mdash;France
of yesterday&mdash;to those heroic and suffering
souls in the France of to-day, who yet
suffer in hope, seeing light through the darkness,
and believing in a new and nobler "France
of to-morrow."' That new and nobler France
is no dream of the ivory gate. This siege of
Paris, to which the siege of Troy seems trivial,
will purge the French people of many evil
qualities, and leave them greater than before.
This is the belief of all who know them well&mdash;who
know how their higher life has been
eclipsed by noxious influences. However this
war may terminate, and whatever may be the
fate of the country of Lothair, it is pretty certain
that the fatal follies which have misguided
the French people are now exploded for ever.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>The Land of the Sun.</i> By Lieutenant <span class="smcap">C. R.
Low</span>. Hodder and Stoughton. 1870.</p>

<p>This book makes no pretensions to be regarded
as a regular diary of connected travel,
but is a series of vivid sketches of such places
in the East as the author frequently visited.
In a succession of interesting chapters he
carries us from place to place, describing each
locality with many of its historical associations,
and his own personal impressions and incidents
of adventure. He tells us something of Aden,
Massowah, and the Red Sea, the Andaman
Islands, and many other places of interest,
some of growing importance; leaving us finally
at that city of romance, Bagdad. Those who
have commercial relations with 'the Land of
the Sun' will find valuable information in this
volume, especially in the chapters on Aden
and Persia. As Mr. Low says, 'The Suez
Canal has opened a new era for Aden and
Persia, and indeed for all the ports of the
Red Sea, and it is impossible to exaggerate
the mighty future in store for them.' It
did not require that the title-page should inform
us that the writer belonged to the navy, for
almost every paragraph contains expressions
which are possible from only a joyous, enthusiastic
sailor-nature. He makes the reader feel
as though he were listening to some clever
Jack-tar, who can describe the places and people
he has visited, and can spin a yarn with
startling effect. The lieutenant revels in adventure,
and any skirmish excites his vigorous
sympathy. Like a true British sailor, he has
an infinite contempt for all his enemies, and a
supreme belief in English seamanship and
courage. Our readers may get considerable
instruction and many a hearty laugh out of
this capital book.</p>

Rapid Journey to the Chief Places of Interest

'Two Months in Spain.' Nisbet and Co.</p>

<p>This little volume is what its title indicates.
It gives useful information, and records the
<i>impressions du voyage</i> of an intelligent traveller.
While it does not wholly refrain from
historical reminiscence and arch&aelig;ological speculation,
it touches them lightly, and without
dogmatism. It is a pleasant record of experiences
in sacred scenes, whose interest no
number of travellers' books can exhaust.

<p class="hang p2"><i>Daybreak in Spain: a Tour of Two Months.</i>
By the Rev. <span class="smcap">J. A. Wylie</span>, LL.D. Cassell,
Petter and Galpin, 1870.</p>

<p>Whatever other distinguishing traits Dr.
Wylie may possess, he is at least a famous
hater of the Papacy. In several former volumes
he appears as the earnest champion of Protestantism,
and in his vigorous declamatory rhetoric
gives the enemy no quarter. It is no matter of
surprise, therefore, that the remarkable movement
in Spain which preceded and followed
the expulsion of Isabella II. should have
awakened his most energetic sympathy. With
a <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> perfectly charming he informs the
reader that he entered Spain on the anniversary
of the Queen's summary dismissal. The coincidence
of the two events may be an important
historical incident, but as yet we fail to see it.
However, he presents to us the results of two
months' tour in a light sketchy manner, though
in a very readable book. His descriptions of
the scenes and people are sometimes vivid, but
they leave the impression of haste and effort
to be striking. The author also compiles a
number of noteworthy facts concerning the
progress of the Gospel in that long unhappy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
land, which enable us to share his prophetic
hopes for its brighter future. The book would
be immensely improved by the omission of
many of those eulogistic paragraphs on the
Bible, which mar the continuity of the narrative,
and read like the perorations of innumerable
speeches. The illustrations by Gustave
Dor&eacute;, which he says (page 12) accompany the
first chapter, are wanting in our copy.</p>

<p>This most admirable and faultless reprint of
the classic history of a great period of our
annals is now completed. Never have publishers
considered more carefully the convenience

The volumes are portable, and the type is suited

consulting Mr. Froude's works is moreover
enhanced by a copious and well-arranged index,
which occupies no fewer than one hundred
pages. The dates are given on every page,
from first to last; and this great work, on
which we have so often commented, is now
placed within the reach of thousands who have
for their perusal of it hitherto had to depend on
library copies. Whatever difference of opinion
may be entertained as to the justness of certain
conclusions, and the good taste of some revelations,
the extraordinary merit of this history
of the most eventful epoch in the development
of the English church, nationality, and constitution,
can hardly be exaggerated.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>Sketches from America.</i> By <span class="smcap">John White</span>,
Fellow of Queen's College, Oxford. Sampson
Low and Co.</p>

<p>Mr. White's book has but very little of the
character of a tourist's book of travels, although
it is, he tells us, 'founded upon a tour
that was undertaken without any design of
collecting materials for a book.' Personal experiences
are but little obtruded. We get the
most of them in the second section, 'A Pic-nic
to the Rocky Mountains.' The party consisted
of newspaper editors and Mr. G. F. Train; who
probably is an editor, and a dozen things besides.
This personal part of Mr. White's book
indicates a keen observer and a graphic pen.
We would gladly, had we space, extract some
of the amusing incidents of his journey. The
first and third parts of the book&mdash;on Canada,
and on the Irish in America&mdash;are disquisitions
founded in part upon personal observation, but
chiefly upon facts and opinions collected from
diversified sources with care and discrimination.
They constitute, therefore, a series of judgments
by Mr. White, and are to be taken simply
as such, <i>quantum valeat</i>. We are bound
to say, however, that they are marked by great
moderation, scholarly intelligence, and plausible
credibility. But clearly, other observers
equally well-informed and judicial, might come
to very different conclusions. We can only
indicate some of Mr. White's opinions. He
points out acutely the distinctive characteristics
of the Canadians; their many points of difference
from the citizen of the States, both in
manners, feeling, and political interest. Canadians
are strong in a theoretic loyalty, and
are proud of their English belongings, while
they have very little of patriotic passion. The
Irish in Canada are not, Mr. White thinks,
so loyal as is often boasted, although they are
less hostile than the Irish in America. They
feel no affection for the English, and, as a class,
desire annexation. The French Canadians are
contented without being patriotic. They are
not annexationists, and see nothing better for
themselves than English rule. The best classes
in Canada, like those in the States, studiously
eschew politics, and affect indifference, even
while the streets of Montreal are crowded at an
exciting election. Mr. White conveys no very
exalted idea of the dignity of Canadian legislation,
by the account he quotes of the behaviour
of the members of the Ottawa Parliament
singing choruses and indulging in other forms
of obstructive boisterousness all night. 'Men,
not measures,' is the Canadian political motto,
although to a less extent than in the United
States. Mr. White gives a good account of
the Church legislation of the last few years,
and of its beneficial results, which we commend
to our Church and State partisans.
While admitting that the feeling of Canada is
adverse to annexation with the States, Mr.
White seems to think that commercial interests
and necessities will make it inevitable&mdash;a forecast
from which there is both room and reason
for differing.</p>

<p>Mr. White's book is, throughout, written
with an amount of information, a scholarly
intelligence and care, and a studied moderation
of feeling, which place it above most books
of its class, and entitle it to a permanent place
in the library. It will have value when the
interest of ephemeral books of mere travel has
passed away.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>The Transformation of Insects.</i> By <span class="smcap">P. Martin
Duncan</span>, F.R.S. Cassell, Petter, and Galpin.</p>

<p>The metamorphoses of insects comprise some
of the most interesting phenomena of the most
attractive class in the animal kingdom. They
lose none of their attractions in the hands of the
enterprising publishers to whose energy the
public are already indebted for so many handsome
and profusely illustrated works on various
branches of natural history.</p>

<p>The present volume, like the rest, abounds
in pictures of all kinds, from those which are
diagrammatic, and should accompany a scientific
treatise, to those which are highly pictorial
and life-like; and they are all of high
merit. Of course, the illustrations, for the
most part, are not original. They do not
come from the hand of the author, nor were
they designed to illustrate his text. No work
with such first-class engravings, drawn expressly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
to elucidate the meaning of a writer,
could be produced at ten times the cost of the
book before us. Collected from all sources,
and more or less judiciously distributed through
the volume, the plates constitute the chief value
of the work. The letter-press, however, like
the illustrations, is full of interesting matter.
Almost all the well-known facts which science
has revealed to us concerning the whole life-history
of the <i>Arthropoda</i>, are stripped of their
technical phraseology, invested in an amusing,
and sometimes a grotesque garb, and displayed
so as to attract those to whom real scientific
study would be repulsive. To our youth, and
to that numerous class of casual and unscientific
observers of Nature who rather delight in
interesting facts than in the causes which
underlie them, 'The Transformation' will, no
doubt, be found amusing and satisfactory. On
the other hand, we are bound to state that
there is nothing in the book before us, either
in the shape of original contribution to our
information, or of philosophic grouping of
phenomena into wider generalizations, which
will really assist the scientific student.</p>

<p>We have purposely mentioned the publishers
rather than the author as the originators of this
work, because the resources of the former are
far more evident than those of the latter.
Probably no one but the publishers could have
produced so handsome and entertaining a
volume at so small an expense, while almost
any one might have been the author of it. We
have also designedly made the plates occupy
the first place in our commendation. It is
evident that the book was made to order from
a large stock in hand. We do not wish to disparage
the work at all, or any more than is
necessary to let the public know exactly what
it is. Such a book would not be written except
to order, and could not be so good unless there
were a large stock of material on hand. Such
books have a definite use, and this particular
book is good of its kind. It is, as it professes
to be, an 'adaptation of M. Emile Blanchard's
work.' If the author had done for his own
work what he has done for M. Blanchard, <i>i.e.</i>,
'eliminated large portions which, although very
interesting, do not refer directly to the phenomena
of metamorphosis,' we should have been
deprived of half the volume; and as the illustrations
could hardly have been crowded more
closely together, we should have lost them also,
and this would have been a great pity. That
the letter-press is but accessory, and sometimes
hardly accessory, to the pictures is abundantly
manifest. Thus, at p. 366, we have a beautiful
engraving representing the transformations of
<i>Cicada fraxini</i>&mdash;an insect belonging to, and
even the type of, the homopterous division of
the order 'Hemiptera'&mdash;incorporated, without
reference to it, into the chapter on the 'Neuroptera;'
while, in the chapter on the 'Hemiptera,'
the metamorphosis of the same species is
described without reference to the engraving.</p>

<p>The term 'insects' is used in the old Linn&aelig;an
sense, and not according to its more modern
and definite scientific signification, and so is
made to include not only moths, bees, beetles,
locusts, dragon-flies, bugs, and flies, and the
orders of which they are the types, but also
spiders, hundred-legs, and crustaceans. <i>The
Metamorphoses of the Arthropoda</i> would be the
more correct title, but this would not have been
so popular, and therefore not so well suited to
a popular work. This dominant idea of rendering
the book popular is always kept in view.
Thus, when we have a description of the habits
of that popular favourite, the water spider
(<i>Argyroneta aquatica</i>), it is hoped, no doubt
with some degree of confidence, that we shall
be so pleased with the wonderful facts, that we
shall forgot to ask why a species which has no
metamorphosis, and belongs to a genus, family,
and order which never exhibit transformations,
should have been introduced to our notice at
all. Again, when we are facetiously told that
<i>Cimex lectularius</i> drops from the ceiling on
to sleepers, and grows more or less rapidly
according to the temperature of the room and
corpulency of its inhabitants, and we have 'to
thank Providence that it has no wings,' it
would be ill-natured to inquire whether the
statements are strictly accurate, and with regard
to the latter statement, to whom we are
indebted for the rest of the anatomy?</p>

<p>Mr. Duncan thinks it only just that M. E.
Blanchard should be relieved from the authorship
of opinions as to the nature of metamorphosis
contained in this work, but as the only part
of the book which treats of metamorphosis philosophically
consists of a long, well-chosen, and
acknowledged quotation from Newport's 'Essay,'
we think this delicate sense of justice
somewhat misplaced.</p>

<p>We cannot too highly recommend the 'Transformation
of Insects' as a glorious picture-book
full of moderately trustworthy anecdotes; but
we warn all students of physiology or natural
history that there is no such royal road to learning
as its pages present.</p>

Topographical Description of the Site,
Buildings, and Neighbourhood of Ancient
Rome.</i> By <span class="smcap">Robert Burn</span>, M.A., Fellow and
Tutor of Trinity College, Cambridge. Deighton
and Co. 1871.</p>

<p>There is something singularly opportune in
the publication of this book at this time. Rome,
dear to all men of taste, for its countless treasures
in the department of the arts&mdash;to all scholars,
for its multitudinous associations with relics
of classical times&mdash;to many a Christian
too, for its memories of our holy religion, has
just passed into new hands, and is henceforth
to be subject to other rulers. We will not
affect to regret this. We have long despaired
of any substantial improvement under the <i>r&eacute;gime</i>
now happily brought to an end; but there
can be no reason, in the nature of things, why
modern Rome should be the worst drained and
dirtiest of Christian cities, and why the Pontine
marshes, once so fruitful, should now be a
pestiferous waste. We believe that a thorough
revolution may be worked, both in Rome itself
and all around it, not only without any detriment
to those precious relics of the old world
with which this volume deals, but with great
advantage to them; and we hope to read ere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
long of the appointment of a commission (we
are not sure what is the proper Italian word
for it) with some such man as the Cavaliere
Rosa at its head, whose business it shall be to
guard with jealous care whatever already discovered
may interest the student of art or of
history, and to watch for new matter of a kindred
nature wherever public works or private
enterprise may lay open the still unworked
mines which underlie in all directions the accumulated
rubbish of many centuries in this city
of Rome. A board of antiquaries and artists,
with two or three practical men amongst them,
may earn for themselves the gratitude of the
civilized world, by an enlightened and earnest
prosecution of this work.</p>

<p>As to the book before us, we can hardly find
words to express our sense of its varied excellence.
It has evidently been a <i>con amore</i> labour
with its author; and he has brought to his work
the three qualifications essential to its thorough
discharge&mdash;learning, sagacity, and zeal. His
references to the classical writings of Rome,
and to those who have been his pioneers in
these researches, prove the first; while the accuracy
with which he observes and compares
both objects and opinions are sufficient evidence
of the other qualities.</p>

<p>Starting with a geological discussion of the
soil on which the city is built, we are introduced
to the original materials for building in
Rome and its immediate neighborhood. There
is abundant evidence of volcanic action in the
tufaceous rock which is characteristic of the
region; and this is associated with the depositions
of water&mdash;both salt and fresh&mdash;and in
some cases has been manifestly modified by
their action. Indeed, there is proof that the
valleys between the famous hills were marshes,
frequently flooded by the Tiber, down into the
early period of Roman history. There are two
sorts of tufa, one more granular, and so lighter
than the other, as well as a fair portion of a
limestone rock, named travertine, harder than
either of the tufas; besides these there is capital
clay for bricks, and matter which makes
the best mortar in the world. We are not surprised,
therefore, to find that not only during
the Republic, but in later times, when, under
the emperors, the wealth and luxury of the
Romans was boundless, the main substance
even of the most magnificent of their buildings
was brick; and marble 'facings,' columns, and
pavements came in to give finish and beauty to
their solid brickwork. Indeed, to this fact we
owe it that so much is still left to us. The
barbarous rapacity of the Middle Ages, which
ruthlessly appropriated these enrichments,
would no doubt have taken all, had all been
marble.</p>

<p>Our author regards the myths which connect
the early Romans with the Greeks, and with
the Trojans under &AElig;neas, as belonging rather
to the domain of poetry than history, and confining
himself to the facts as illustrated by
these ruins, begins with the Palatine, as the
hill originally occupied by the first fathers of
the Romans; and he gives us, in chronological
order, as far as possible, notices of all ruins
now uncovered there. He then passes on to
the Capitoline, as having been occupied next in
point of time, dealing with it in the same manner;
after this we return southward to the
Aventine; thence, turning east, we cross the
valley of the Circus Maximus to the C&aelig;lian
Hill, and then proceed northward to the Esquiline,
the Viminal, Quirinal, and Pincian, in succession.
On all these we are introduced to
the remains of ancient buildings; their chronology,
their identity, their extent, their present
condition, and their associations with such historic
matter as has come down to us, are all
set before us with great accuracy of detail.
Then we cross the Tiber, and visit Janiculum
and the Vatican Hill; recrossing into the valleys
among the hills, we visit the Circus Maximus,
the Campus Martius (now occupied by
the modern city), and the Via Lata. The
'Forum' (Romanum) is discussed in the earlier
part of the work, and with it the Fora of the
emperors, which were meant to supersede it
and its associations, and did so. The line of
the walls of Servius, built mainly of the tufa
already mentioned, in large rectangular blocks,
is traced all round the city with ingenious care;
and then the more extensive walls of Aurelian,
with notices of the fortifications of the present
day. Before we have done we take a delightful,
though hasty, run through the Campagna.
We visit Hadrian, at his villa Tiburtina (Tivoli);
Cicero, at Tusculum (Frascati); and dear old
Horace, at his Sabine farm. At Laurentum we
inspect, in detail, the country seat of our communicative
host, the unlucky Pliny, who perished
miserably when Pompeii was destroyed.</p>

<p>We would gratefully acknowledge our sense
of obligation to our intelligent guide; and shall
reckon it henceforward as among our pleasantest
reminiscences that we have thus visited
with him the spot where Virginia bled, where
Cicero spoke, where C&aelig;sar fell; that we have,
in his company, trodden the Forum, the Capitol,
and the Appian way; and wandered, silent
and awe-stricken at their grandeur, in the golden
house of Nero, the Forum of Trajan, the
Coliseum of Vespasian, and the baths of Diocletian.</p>

<p>We must not close our notice without a word
about the maps and ground plans, and the
illustrations. All are worthy of the work.
Here and there, in the ground plans, we miss
the arrow-head, indicating the points of the
compass, and this, we hold, should always be
put in; and if the illustrations, engraved from
photographs, as we are told, are a trifle too
sharp and hard, we gain in accuracy what we
lose in beauty, and would not have it otherwise.
We heartily thank Mr. Burn for his
valuable work, and his publishers for the style
in which they have put it forth; and shall be
only too happy to find it in our portmanteau
when we next visit Rome.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>The Wonders of Engraving.</i> By <span class="smcap">Georges Duplessis</span>.
Illustrated with Ten Reproductions
in Autotype, and Thirty-four Wood Engravings,
by P. Selher. Sampson Low, Son, and
Marston.</p>

<p>This translation of 'Les Merveilles de la Gravure'
will doubtless, in the words of the editor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
be 'acceptable to all lovers of this important
and deeply interesting branch of art. It traces
from its different origins in wood engraving
and <i>nielli</i>, this effort of one high art to become
the handmaid and herald of another, until the
genius of the engraver has developed a comprehensive
department of original design and
elaborate artistic work of his own. Our author
has told the story of this development as it unfolds
itself in the different schools of Italian
art in Spain, in Flanders, in Holland, in Germany,
England, and France. This necessitates
brief sketches of distinguished engravers in
wood or copper, belonging to all these countries,
with some account of their works. As many
of these engravers are far better known to
fame by their paintings, we have fresh interesting
details concerning the life-work of Leonardo
da Vinci, Marc Antonio Raimondi, Albrecht
D&uuml;rer, Rembrandt, Ruysdael, Lucas v. Leyden,
Paul Potter, Hogarth, Gillray, Nicolas
Poussin, and Claude Lorraine, with very many
others. The author rather glories in a clever
reference which he made of some anonymous
engraving of the early Italian school to the
hand of Leonardo himself, and in some interesting
and independent confirmation of his
guess, which he afterwards derived from other
quarters. To those who have not made the
art of engraving a practical and prolonged
study, many of these chapters may have the
appearance of a catalogue of strange names,
and of partially comprehended work, rather
than of a dissertation to make one wise. The
transition is rapid from one great name to another,
and the volume will be used as a book
of reference rather that as a continuous treatise.
The autotype copies of several old engravings,
as well as numerous woodcuts,
greatly enliven and enrich the pages. It is
very interesting to see in this department of
human endeavour, how great results have followed
accidental discovery. The Italian goldsmiths,
who, before running their enamel
(<i>nigellum</i>) into the ornamented and engraved
gold, tried the effect of their work by staining
paper or linen, and by the impressions (<i>nielli</i>)
which the engraved surface when first washed
with colouring matter would produce, no more
anticipated the extraordinary development
which their chance trials would receive, than
could the early printers have prophesied the
marvels of the modern printing-press. M.
Duplessis has briefly and clearly enumerated
and described all, or nearly all, of the processes
of engraving. We are surprised that he has
not given some place to the wonderful process
of lithography. The volume is a marvel of
finish and beauty.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>Art in the Mountains.</i> By <span class="smcap">Henry Blackburn</span>.
London: Sampson Low, Son, and Marston.</p>

<p>Mr. Blackburn is well-known as a traveller
with a special faculty; he has an artist's eye,
and his record of wanderings in Algeria, Spain,
Normandy, are pages of picture. Hence was
he the very man to make a pilgrimage into the
Bavarian highlands, and bring back an intelligible
account of that strange Passion-Play performed
by the peasants of Ober-Ammergau;
and excellently well he has done it. There is
something strange, something almost weird in
the enactment of a medi&aelig;val miracle-play in
this nineteenth century&mdash;by peasants, too, who
are some of them before Paris by this time,
obeying Bismarck's iron will. Extremes meet
in the oddest manner. As to this old-fangled
representation, which has come off once a decade
for the last two centuries, there seems to
be nothing irreverent about it. They are a
child-like folk, these Bavarian peasants; they
have no Prussian <i>geist</i>; they possess a strong
imitative faculty, such as belonged to the first
villagers who, in ancient Greece, originated
what we now call comedy. Mr. Blackburn's
illustrations amply show what sort of people
they are. Look at the maiden at page 59, with
the mild bovine eye that Homer loves to attribute
to Hebe, and the well-shapen yet utterly
unlightened face, and the comfortable, unfascinating
curves of shoulder and arm, a woman&mdash;a
dull, good, unimaginative 'young person'&mdash;with
no tendency towards witchery or ladyhood.
Having examined that portrait, you have
no difficulty in understanding how it is that a
Passion-Play lives alongside the railway and
the telegraph. The slow-moving, cow-eyed
maiden is typical; that she would heartily and
reverently enjoy the show of our Lord's Passion
is clear enough. But how long she, and
such as she, will crawl on in their snail-like
groove, now that our 'own correspondent' has
appeared in Ammergau, now that the representatives
of Judas Iscariot and Pontius Pilate have
gone together to besiege Paris, is a question
not easy to settle. Mr. Blackburn states that
there will probably be ten performances of the
Passion Play in 1871, and that then it will not
be repeated till 1880. We commend anybody
who really desires to see it to go to Ammergau
next year. We move fast nowadays&mdash;that
Bavarian village will be quite another sort of
place in 1880.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>Church Design for Congregations: its Developments
and Possibilities.</i> By <span class="smcap">James Cubitt</span>,
Architect. With nineteen plates. Smith
and Elder.</p>

<p>The practical divorce of Art and Utility has
told nowhere more disastrously than in the
building of churches. Gothic buildings with
'long-drawn aisles and fretted roof,' designed
and adapted for the processional and ritual
worship of the Romish Church, have for three
centuries been the dreary reverberating theatres
of Protestant reading and preaching. Perhaps
few of us could recall a more comfortless ideal
than a rural parish church in winter, half the
congregation excluded from seeing, and the
other half from hearing the monotonous reader
of prayers and sermons. Nonconformists,
while rightly deeming that the Episcopal
Church had no monopoly of Gothic architecture,
have not been always wise in their appropriation
of it. They have built the old
Gothic church with its nave, two aisles, transepts,
and chancel, its clustered stone pillars
and clerestory, utterly unmindful of the fact
that of all styles of ecclesiastical building it was
the most unsuited for their worship and preaching.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
Their dignified discomfort led to the substitution
of iron columns, as incongruous, and,
in artistic effect, as ugly as anything that could
be imagined&mdash;'a medi&aelig;val church,' as Mr.
Cubitt says, 'in the last stage of starvation.'
If we must have nave and aisles, as he justly
remarks, we seem shut up either to bad arrangement
or bad architecture. Fame and fortune
await the architect who can create a new
order of buildings for Congregational worship
which shall avoid both. Mr. Cubitt seems ambitious
to attempt this, and he breaks a lance
with old conventionalism with great courage
and skill. The type that is required, he says,
'does not present itself in the ordinary nave
and aisles plan, whether its nave-piers are thick
or thin; but it may be hopefully sought in
either of these two ways&mdash;'by designing our
churches without columns at all, or by designing
them with substantial columns placed where
they will cause no obstruction. The former
system is already adopted in small buildings,
and there are some signs of its future employment
on a larger scale. It allows great variety
of form. Its plans may be oblong, cruciform,
circular, or polygonal; or still better, a fresh
combination of three different elements. On
the latter system the columns may be few in
number and far apart, or they may be placed
so near the side walls as to obscure, not the
seats, but only the passages leading to them.
We may thus have either the wide nave with
narrow side aisles, or the ordinary nave with
very wide bays, or both together. We may
plan a grand open space before the pulpit and
communion table&mdash;surely a natural arrangement
for a Protestant Church&mdash;and we shall
find ample scope for architecture in its external
and internal treatment.' The subsequent
chapters are virtually a development and illustration
of these ideas. The writer advocates
the admission of the dome into Gothic architecture;
he has much to say on behalf of the
Eastern mosque; and no one who has stood in
the vast and simple area of St. Sophia, at Constantinople,
built, it must be remembered, as
a Christian church, could fail to have been
greatly impressed with its magnificent congregational
capabilities. Galleries in theatre form,
iron column churches, lanterns, and most other
things that perplex church builders, are discussed.
The merit of Mr. Cubitt's work is
that it is strictly utilitarian. It recognises the
actual necessities, not only of Congregational
worship, but of Congregational church builders;
it boldly grapples with all inartistic incongruities;
it avoids 'schools' and 'orders,' and
honestly seeks to supply what is wanted under
genuine artistic conditions. Abundance of
plates and drawings illustrate Mr. Cubitt's
theories. We heartily commend this book to
all whom it may concern, as the most independent,
intelligent, and scholarly attempt in
the direction indicated that has been made.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>The Window; or, the Loves of the Wrens.</i>
Words written for Music, by <span class="smcap">Alfred Tennyson</span>,
Poet Laureate; the Music by <span class="smcap">Arthur
Sullivan</span>. Strahan.</p>

<p>So many rumours have been for so long in
circulation about this volume, and the names
of its joint authors are so eminent, that it is
not surprising it should have excited much curiosity
and many hopes. We venture to predict
that neither the curiosity nor the hopes
will be disappointed. Mr. Tennyson's songs
need not fear being 'tested' in the same crucible
with the 'Lotos Eaters,' or 'In Memoriam,'
or we may add with 'Maud,' or the 'Princess.'
Nor will Mr. Sullivan's music be found
less characteristic of his genius, or other than
fully worthy of the words to which it has been
composed.</p>

<p>The 'Window' is, we believe, the first attempt
in English&mdash;certainly the first attempt
of any eminent English poet&mdash;to cast a series of
events or emotions into the form of a set of connected
songs. Wordsworth's well-known series
of sonnets are an approach to the same thing;
but the song&mdash;a composition of two or three
stanzas, suitable to music&mdash;is not so favourite a
form with English poets as with those of Germany.
There the cycle of songs&mdash;the <i>Liederkreis</i>
or <i>Liedercyclus</i>&mdash;is better known. Readers
of Heine and Chamisso will remember more
than one instance. We are glad to welcome it
to English literature, not only as a new form of
verse, but also because of the promise which it
gives of many a marriage between fine poetry
and fine music&mdash;a marriage hitherto far too
rare among us.</p>

<p>The 'Window,' then, is a 'circle of songs,'
twelve in number, describing the hopes and
fears of a lover parted from his mistress, and
uncertain what her reply will be to the great
question he has asked her.</p>

<p>In the first&mdash;'On the hill'&mdash;he stands on the
slope of the valley which separates his home
from hers, and as he looks across the distance
sees the flash from the window-pane of his
love:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">  'The lights and shadows fly!</p>
<p>Yonder it brightens and darkens down on the plain.</p>
<p class="i1">  A jewel, a jewel dear to a lover's eye!</p>
<p>O is it the brook, or a pool, or her window-pane,</p>
<p class="i1">  When the winds are up in the morning?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">  'Clouds that are racing above,</p>
<p>And winds and lights and shadows that cannot be still,</p>
<p class="i1">  All running on one way to the home of my love,</p>
<p>You are all running on, and I stand on the slope of the hill,</p>
<p class="i1">  And the winds are up in the morning!'</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>He knows the window of which the flash has
thus come to him, and is familiar with all the
charm both of what surrounds it, and what it
enshrines:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span></p>

<p>All of flowers, and drop me a flower,</p>

<p>The flowers are there, but their mistress is
gone:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>The letter is sent, and no answer comes; and
then he despairs, as he well may, and in the
'wet west wind' of the spring he wishes himself
dead:</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>And the grass will grow when I am gone,</p>

</div>

<p>The answer is still delayed:&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p>Surely these songs, even in the fragmentary
state in which we have been forced to give
them, will be recognized as the work of a great
master, by everyone who has the feeling and
the fancy requisite for any appreciation of
poetry, and are surely as worthy of Mr. Tennyson's
genius as Shakspeare's songs are of his,
or the lyrics in 'Wilhelm Meister' of Goethe's.
They are full of the old exquisite art that has
endeared the songs of the 'Princess' to so
many thousand hearts. We find here, as in
those and other old favourites, those lovely
and indescribable touches which seem to paint
in sound or air the very things they name&mdash;the</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'Winds and lights and shadows that cannot be still;'</p>
</div>

<p>the</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'Wet west wind, how you blow, how you blow;'&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>There is the alliteration that is so magical
because so seldom used&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'Woods where we hid from the wet,</p>
<p class="i1">Stiles where we stay'd to be kind,</p>
<p>Meadows in which we met;'</p>
</div>

<p>There are the familiarity with nature and the
accurate observation at once so characteristic
of English poetry and of Mr. Tennyson's
muse&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>'The blue woodlouse and the plump dormouse.'</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">'The wren with the crown of gold.'</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>'The fire-crowned king of the wrens from out of the pine!</p>
<p class="i1">Look how they tumble the blossoms, the mad little tits!</p>
<p>Cuckoo! Cuckoo! was ever a May so fine;'</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>There too the hundred links of connexion
which bind the twelve songs into one golden
chain&mdash;the constant references to the 'light,'
or the 'blaze,' or the 'flash,' or the 'window
pane,' which form the keynote of the whole;
and lastly the human sentiment at once so
deep and broad which fuses the whole into
poetry in its noblest sense&mdash;all these proclaim
the deep and abiding worth of this unpretending
series of lyrics.</p>

<p>The Shakspearian ring in one or two of
them (especially in No. 8), is as obvious, though
in a different vein, as in any of the well-known
lyrics in the 'Idylls of the King.'</p>

<p>It will be obvious that we do not agree with
those who regard Mr. Tennyson's last effort as
'a trifle from beginning to end.' Slight in
texture it may be, but slightness is not triviality.</p>

<p>Mr. Sullivan's task in setting these charming
songs to music has not been without its difficulties.
The very qualities which render verse
characteristic of its author often militate
strongly against its adaptability to music. The
subtleties which form the main charm of the
poet may be mere blemishes and hindrances to
the musician. Irregularity of metre and
variety of form are among his most serious
difficulties. What the composer requires is a
strong pervading sentiment or idea to inspire
character to his music, with regular even verse
for the vehicle. The finest songs of Schubert,
Mendelssohn, and Schumann are written to
little poems of the simplest structure, almost
always in stanzas of four lines of eight or ten
feet, the syllables linked together in easy concatenation.
Such are the 'Auf Fl&uuml;geln des
Gesanges,' the 'Widmung,' the 'Junge Nonne,'
and the 'Sey mir gegr&uuml;sst.' Was it instinct
or calculation that led Goethe, Heine, Eichendorff,
and other great poets of Germany, to
throw so many of their enchanting thoughts
and passionate emotions into these simple
forms? Whichever it was, the end has fully
justified the means; and the poems of these
great geniuses have a double beauty and a
double gift of immortality in the strains of
their composer-brethren. Now the very charm
of the songs of the 'Window' on which we
have been insisting, and so rightly insisting, are
all in opposition to those of the poems just
spoken of. What is he to make of such
stanzas as</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="i1">'Gone!</p>
<p>Gone till the end of the year,</p>
<p>Gone! and the light gone with her, and left me in shadow here.</p>
<p>Gone&mdash;flitted away'?</p>
</div>

<p>or such unequal lines as</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'Go little letter apace, apace,</p>
<p class="i2">Fly!'</p>
</div>

<p>or,</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'For it's ay, ay, ay, ay, ay;'</p>
</div>

<p>or,</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'And my thoughts are as quick and as quick, ever on, on, on'?</p>
</div>

<p>If we want to see what can be made of them,
by what adroit shifts their difficulties can be
avoided and overcome, we have only to turn to
Mr. Sullivan's music; and the examination
will well repay the trouble, and will open the
eyes of anyone who was not before aware of
the laws which must govern verse that is to be
married to music. No. 6 has been altered
since it was set, and we thus have the advantage
of two versions.</p>

<p>For the music itself we must really refer our
readers to the book. Dissertations on music,
unless in connection with actual performance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
or with technical study, are very much like
attempts to paint a sunrise in words. At any
rate, without musical quotations, any description
of these songs would be unintelligible.</p>

<p>The finest of the set are indisputably the
first and the last. Next, perhaps, for depth of
sorrow, comes No. 7, 'The mist and the rain.'
No. 3, 'Gone,' with its persistent accompaniment,
is beautiful. Of the tender songs, Nos.
9 and 10 are especially charming, while No. 4
is a bold air, which we venture to predict will
be in the mouth of many an amateur baritone
before a month is out. We have only one
word of regret to add&mdash;if regret be not too
strong a term. We wish that Mr. Sullivan
had availed himself of the chance which the
words gave him to do what Beethoven has so
finely done in his 'Liederkreis,' namely, to re-introduce
the melody of the first song in the
last one, and thus make his work really a
'circle.' But this is so obvious that we do not
doubt he had some sufficient reason for not
doing it.</p>

<p>Mr. Sullivan has written many fine songs;
and indeed great as is his genius for the
orchestra, it often seems as if it were equally
great for vocal music. And it is not too much
to say that in this direction at least, his last
effort has been his greatest, and that these
songs surpass all that he has written before.
Of their popularity among the best class of
amateurs&mdash;that class which we delight to believe
is rapidly increasing&mdash;there can be no
doubt. They will want not only good singing,
but what is rarer still, good accompanying,
and we trust some opportunity may be shortly
found for their being given in public by Mr.
Reeves and Mr. Stockhausen, or Mr. Santley,
accompanied by the composer himself. After
that we are bold enough to hope that he may
score some of them for the orchestra. Connected
though they be, they are not indivisible,
and there are several which would not suffer
by being taken from their place in the 'cycle'
and transferred singly to the concert-room.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>The Paradise of Birds.</i> By <span class="smcap">William John
Courthope</span>. Edinburgh: William Blackwood
and Sons.</p>

<p>Verily the young English poet who dares tread in
the footsteps of the Attic Aristophanes has a fine
audacity. This does Mr. Courthope, and not
altogether without justification. He is a lover
of birds; he is disgusted at the way in which
they are murdered at pigeon matches, and for
the adornment of ladies' hats. He goes to
Aristophanes for inspiration, and gives us a
very charming poem as the result. Mr. Courthope
is unquestionably a poet. The fault we
find <i>in limine</i> is, that he is not sufficiently
original and varied in rhyme and rhythm, for
a professed follower of Aristophanes. All the
birds of the air sing in the pages of the mighty
Greek, sing in character, with the very music
that belongs to them. We cannot say this of
Mr. Courthope, yet is he often fortunate and
felicitous. Here is the Nightingale, pitying us
unfeathered bipeds:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'Man that is born of a woman,</p>
<p class="i1">Man, her un-web-footed drake,</p>
<p>Featherless, beakless, and human,</p>
<p class="i1">Is what he is by mistake.</p>
<p>For they say that a sleep fell on nature</p>
<p class="i1">In the midst of the making of things;</p>
<p>And she left him a two-legged creature,</p>
<p class="i1">But wanting in wings.'</p>
</div>

<p>Wings! ay, that is what we should all of us
like. Fancy being able to soar and tumble in
mid-ether, like those pigeons that flash round
our roofs. Fancy having power to follow the
summer like 'the temple-haunting martlet,'
which leaves its house under our eaves for a residence
somewhere in Central Asia! What Mr.
Courthope wants, in our judgment, is greater
imaginative intensity: he plays laughingly with
his theme, and even so did Aristophanes, his
master; but he does not attain as yet the lofty
poetry, the strong humour, which are born of
earnestness in Aristophanes.</p>

<p>There is curious variety of style, of finish,
and of theme in this little volume. A classical
epos is followed by a monody on Lord Derby,
and translations from Horace and Heine.
Elegies on Napoleon, Peabody, and Mozart, are
interspersed with love ditties and theological
speculations. A discussion of the probable

<p>There is some spirit and fire in the 'Song of

<p>There is a charm of novelty and freshness
about these poems. The thoughts expressed
are often both original and beautiful; and in
this lies the chief attraction of the book. The
language in which the thoughts are clothed is
not remarkable for elegance, and the style is
occasionally rather obscure, but the reader will
find it worth his while to take the little trouble
that may now and then be needed fully to grasp
the author's meaning. There is no particular
arrangement in the poems, but they all turn in
some way on the subject indicated in the title-page;
one (by no means the best of them) describing
an Utopian world perverted and ruled
by love alone. There is an elevated tone of
feeling about the work in general, befitting the
high theme to which it is devoted. We will
content ourselves with one specimen of the
poetry, though it would be easy to select many.

<p class="hang"><i>The Inner Life: a Poem.</i> By <span class="smcap">William Tidd
Matson</span>. Elliot Stock.</p>

<p>Mr. Matson does not now first come before
the world as a poet, but in his best poem, on
'The Inner Life,' he has done something better
than any of his previous productions. The
book consists of meditations, not perhaps very
strictly connected, yet passing naturally from
one into another&mdash;all treating on themes of the
deepest interest, as the title implies; the poetical
strains adding greatly to the charm of the
Christian philosophy that is conveyed in them.
It is true poetry, though not poetry of the
highest order. The reader of this little work
will be glad to turn to a volume of poems by
the same author which appeared some years
ago. Mr. Matson speaks in the preface to this
book of the joy he has found in poetry. We
do not feel in his case as we are sometimes
tempted to do, that the poet himself is the
only person benefited&mdash;the pleasure found in
making the verse being the only pleasure it can
ever afford. Far from this: we are much indebted
to Mr. Matson for giving his poetry to
the world. The versification is unusually easy
and flowing&mdash;no straining after effect; no determination
to be original at all costs: all seems
to come naturally and without effort. There is
an evenness of merit in the poems which would
make it difficult to specify one above another;
but one characteristic marks them all, and distinguishes
them from those of many other writers,
<i>i.e.</i>, the Christian sentiment by which
they are all pervaded. Instead of the wail of
unrelieved disappointment and regret for the
past, and dark and vague forebodings for the
future, the voice of resignation and heavenly
hope is never wanting, mingled with the plaintive
strains in which we always expect to hear
a poet sing. We cordially recommend both the
books to all lovers of this class of poetry among
our readers.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>The In-Gathering</i>. By <span class="smcap">John A. Heraud</span>.
Simpkin, Marshall and Co.</p>

<p>Mr. Heraud, whose first poem was published
in 1820, ten years before Tennyson, shows no
perceptible decrease of poetic faculty now, after
the lapse of half a century. It is doubtless
true with some men that</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'The soul's dark cottage, battered and decayed,</p>
<p>Lets in new light through chinks that time has made.'</p>
</div>

<p>The little volume before us contains 'Cimon
and Pero,' a series of two hundred somewhat
mystical sonnets under the title of 'Alcyone,'
and several minor poems. 'Cimon and Pero,'
which we prefer to any of the other poems, is
based on the fine old story, told by Valerius
Maximus, of the Greek woman, who, to save
her imprisoned father from starvation, fed him
at her own breast. Mr. Heraud has avowedly
chosen to tell the tale in the austere style of
Wordsworth's noble 'Laodamia,' and not without
success. It may be but a fable this, but
no fable is devoid of significance, and we may
say with Valerius, 'Putaret aliquis hoc contra
rerum naturam factum, nisi deligere parentes
prima natur&aelig; lex esset.' Several of the minor
poems have a delicate beauty: among these
may specially be noted the short lyric entitled
'Eres,' which is quite in Herrick's vein; the
well-known story of 'The Brides of Venice' is
also pleasantly told. The author's admirers
will be glad to find that he has still the vigour
and versatility of his youth, with greater skill
of artistic execution.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>The Poetical Works of William Cowper.</i> Edited,
with Notes and Biographical Introduction,
by <span class="smcap">William Benham</span>, Vicar of Addington.
Globe Edition. Macmillan and Co.</p>

<p>It was a matter of course that Cowper's
works should form a volume of the Globe
series. His popularity has scarcely waned
since he first became the poet of the religious
world, beloved for his piety by those who had
but small appreciation of his poetry, and admired
for his poetry by those who had but little
sympathy with his themes or his spirit. As
a realistic painter of middle-class life he anticipated,
and in delicacy and sensibility infinitely
surpasses Crabbe; while as a humorist of the
purest water he took the kind of hold upon the
general public that Sydney Smith afterwards
did&mdash;only Cowper's humour was more delicate
and subtle&mdash;and as a poet of nature he was the
literary progenitor of Wordsworth. Mr. Benham's
biographical introduction is very carefully
and very modestly done. He is, we think,
right in his judgment on the point questioned
by the <i>Spectator</i>, 'that Lady Austen would
gladly have married Cowper;' and perfectly
conclusive, we think, is the evidence concerning
the contemplated marriage with Mary Unwin.
Newton and Bull were Cowper's most intimate
friends, and the denial of Southey, who was by
no means so accurate as the <i>Spectator</i> assumes,
cannot be put against their positive and explicit
evidence. The works are arranged in chronological
order, and the notes are intelligent, accurate,
and true. Altogether, we possess in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
the Globe volume the best edition of Cowper
hitherto given to the world.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>The Poetical Works of John and Charles Wesley,
reprinted from the Originals, with the
latest Corrections of the Authors; together
with the poems of Charles Wesley not before
published.</i> Collected and arranged by <span class="smcap">E.
Osborn</span>, D.D. Vols. VII. to X.</p>

<p>This admirably edited collection of the poetical
works of the Wesleys proceeds steadily towards
its completion. It reveals a surprising
fecundity of verse, and an amazing degree of
sustained fervour, strength, and excellence.
There are treasures of song in Charles Wesley's
compositions, unused and unknown as yet
by the Church, that would give him high rank
as a hymn writer, independently of the compositions
which are in every church and on every
lip. We do not think he ever reaches the reverent
sublimity of the best hymns of Watts.
Watts, for instance, would scarcely have used
the somewhat incongruous adjective 'tremendous
deity;' nor would Watts have fallen into
the German jingles of some of his metres; but
in devout inspiration, sacred passion, and felicitous
verse, Wesley holds his own against any
hymn writer of the Church of Christ. We
shall have more to say concerning him when
the collection of his poetical works is complete.
The eighth volume contains his admirable version
of the Psalms, and a great variety of personal
and national hymns, which furnish a
kind of devotional commentary on the history
of both. The ninth volume consists of the
first portion of the short hymns on 'Select
Passages of the Holy Scriptures.' The two-volume
edition of 1762 has long been a table
book with us. We specially commend some of
Wesley's exquisite poetical versions or uses&mdash;this,
for instance:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'O that I knew where I might find him,</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>A Syren.</i> By <span class="smcap">J. Adolphus Trollope</span>. Three
vols. Smith, Elder and Co.</p>

<p>Mr. J. A. Trollope has returned to the scenes
of his first love&mdash;to Italian skies, artists, maidens,
marchesi, and friars. We are plunged at
once into the hot sunshine and tropical excitements
of a Ravennese Carnival. The author
gives us exuberant descriptions of female
beauty, of fastidious adornment, dexterous
<i>deshabille motiv&eacute;e</i>, and of fierce sexual passion
met by cold calculating resolve to play a high
stake without love, or faithfulness, or even
wisdom. Mr. Trollope is matchless in his portraiture
of Italian <i>artistes</i>, and of the simple
<i>contadina</i> of refined and delicate taste, and
pure seraphic devotion to the one over-mastering
affection. He has, in this story, contrasted
the natures of two beautiful portionless girls,
who by strange fortune are thrown, during the
same carnival, into the way of the two Marchesi
Castelmare. The one is an opera singer,
the other a painter. The former resolves on
making a conquest of the elder nobleman, and
the latter does win the affections of the younger.
The uncle is described as the pattern of
the highest virtue, of stone-cold passions, of
infinite proprieties; and La Lalli, the syren,
succeeds during the carnival in bewitching, maddening,
and befooling him into promise of marriage,
and inspiring the most deadly jealousy
of any interference with his claim. A noble
nature is ruined by the fierce fires of a foolish
attachment, and most tragic are the issues. We
will not diminish the fascination of the story
by revealing its secret. <i>La diva Lalli</i> is actually
murdered on the very day when the old
marchese has publicly admitted his intention
to marry her, and everybody but the murderer
seems to have run the risk of having to bear
the brunt of the charge. More than a volume
is occupied with an endeavour to answer the
question, 'Who has done the deed?' There is
more delicacy, and subtlety, and meaning in the
inquiry, than in the inquiry, 'Who killed Tulkinghorn?'
and the reader is reminded of the
heart-searching of Mr. Browning's 'Ring and
Book,' rather than of Mr. Dickens's popular
story. The story cannot be called pleasing or
profitable. It is a wonderful drawing, full of
brilliant effects, and crowded with narrative
and suggestion. The style is clear, and the
Italian expletives and appellatives give it an
operatic grace and sweetness that are very attractive.
If '<i>tesoro mio</i>' had been translated
'duck of diamonds,' and the rest of the prettiness
turned into plain English, perhaps the blue
sky and the <i>circolo</i> and the <i>carnival</i> would
have had to vanish likewise.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>Against Time.</i> By <span class="smcap">Alexander Innes Shand</span>.
Two vols. Smith, Elder and Co. 1870.</p>

<p>The machinery that Mr. Shand has contrived
is clumsy, and looks like a violent effort to
be original. The hero of the story is put into
circumstances of maddening temptation to
make money by unfair means. He is exasperated
by discovering that a relative has made
him sole heir to her vast estates, on the proviso
that in the course of three years he developes
out of the few thousands that are left to
him, a fortune equal to that which he may then
receive. On his failing to fulfil this condition,
the designation of the property is concealed
from all except a pair of contemptible villains,
who endeavour to play a series of underhand
tricks to secure it ultimately for their own uses.
The hero came from the Kursaals of Germany
to hear of this race that he had to run 'against
time,' and he is determined, by huge speculation,
to win the prize. The monetary scheme,
the Credit Foncier and Mobilier of Turkey, is
described by one who has seen the eggs of
many of these vipers hatched in the sun of
England's prosperity. There is a grandeur about
the conception, and a rapidity in the inflation
of this great balloon, that is enough to take
away the breath of ordinary financiers. The
young aristocrat is the Ulysses in council, the
Achilles in strife, the Bayard <i>sans peur, sans
reproche</i>; and though he makes, in the course
of three years, some quarter of a million sterling,
and might claim the possession of family
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
estates, he has positively contrived to withdraw
the greater part of it from the 'concern,' and
to have done it without dishonour. He has
been dabbling up to the elbows in boiling pitch,
and is neither scorched, nor blistered, nor defiled.
Most surprising is his nobility. When
the bubble bursts, he has the magnanimity and
magnificence voluntarily to sacrifice his splendid
fortune, and more splendid prospects, at the
shrine of the honour which seems for a moment
in the dust. Finally, of course it all
turns out for the best, and the young lady who
has won the heart of the great financier is prepared
to second his sublime sacrifice, and as the
two are starting for Australia in beautiful poverty,
it turns out that on the bridegroom's failing
to fulfil the conditions of the will, the penniless
bride has herself become the heiress of
the immense estates, and so the pair are happy
ever after. There is much brilliant writing in
the story, some caustic satire, and a great deal
of clever and pleasant characterization.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>Diary of a Novelist.</i> By the Author of 'Rachel's
Secret,' 'Nature's Nobleman,' &amp;c.
Hurst and Blackett. 1871.</p>

<p>The title of this volume is attractive. What
speculations and hopes are excited by the mere
announcement, 'Diary of a Novelist!' The
secrets into which curious readers have attempted
to pry are about to be unfolded, the
originals of the characters described are to be
revealed, a real personal living interest is to
surround the author's fictions ever after. What
would we give to have such a diary from the
pen of George Eliot or Charles Dickens! But
amid such a rush of eager anticipations, we
turn to the book itself, and find that no explanations
are given&mdash;the authoress does not lift the
veil. It is the journal of a year's most striking
thoughts and noteworthy experiences. The
first feeling is one of disappointment that the
volume is so different from our expectations;
but disappointment soon changes into hearty
admiration and sincere gratitude. It is emphatically
a good book. Sympathy with all
that is beautiful and noble pervades the whole,
and it is written with the ease of a practised
hand. The rippling chat runs on through a
succession of bright sunny scenes, ever and
anon deepening into shady pools of profounder
thought, and then again merrily hastening on
its way. We are permitted to read the aims
of this novelist's life, so true, pure, earnest,
that we involuntarily exclaim, 'O si sic omnia!'
There is also a cheerful religiousness in this
diary, which will equally surprise those who
think that a fiction-writer's only use is for
amusement, and those who indiscriminately
condemn all novels as unmitigated evils. The
following sentence gives us the key-note of the
book:&mdash;'I like to feel that this fair earth, which
God has made, which even now, where man has
not marred it, keeps the touch of his hand upon
it still&mdash;breathes back its life to Him in love.
And so the whole world becomes to me at once
a Temple and a Home&mdash;a place for worship and
for happy life: and I live in it, not alone, but
sharing with all created things in the great Father's
care, and joining with them in their
many-voiced psalm of love and praise.' The
charming sketches of natural scenery show the
touch of an artist and a poet; the outline descriptions
of character reveal the writer as a
keen observer of human life; while her reflections
on some of the tangled problems of the
world tell us that she, too, has wrestled with
the mighty mystery, and found peace only in
trust.</p>

<p>We notice an exuberance of enthusiasm
which might be toned down with advantage to
the general style. The attempt to transcribe
the Yorkshire dialect is not successful; but, as
we have ourselves failed in that accomplishment,
we appreciate the difficulty, and only notice
the fact&mdash;'a fellow feeling makes us wondrous
kind.'</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>The Iliad of the East.</i> By <span class="smcap">Frederick Richardson</span>.
Macmillan.</p>

<p>The title of this book is of course <i>ad captandum</i>;
the East has no Iliad, in any intelligible
sense. What is here offered us is a series
of legends, taken from Valmiki's Sanskrit
poem, the 'Ramagana,' and taken from the
French version of M. Fauche. It is a readable
little volume, and may be recommended to
those who desire to obtain some slight knowledge
of the early Sanskrit poetry. When we
compare a work like the Ramagana with the
Iliad and Odyssey, we cannot avoid the conclusion
that in the Greek mind there existed a vivid
view of poetry, which is quite absent from
the Hindoo mind. Rama's adventures are absurdly
grotesque. We meet garrulous vultures,
chivalrous monkeys, and so forth. The
supreme imagination, which obtains a sublime
effect by depicting humanity in its intensest
forms, as in Achilles, Diomed, Odysseus, as in
Helen, Andromache, Penelope, has no place in
the Oriental poems. They are childish, exaggerated,
mere nursery tales. The theorists,
foremost among whom is Mr. Max M&uuml;ller, who
conceived that both the Greek and Sanskrit
poetry come from one source, ought assuredly
to explain to us why there exists so wide a difference
between the Homeric poems and all the
Oriental cycle. Homer's epic, like the goddess
Athene, seems to have sprung perfect in person
and panoply from the brain of its creator.
The Eastern pseudo-epics are mere strings of
ridiculous stories, with no definite connection,
no beginning, middle, or end. This manifest
literary difference would appear to indicate some
definite racial difference. Valmiki is not an
entirely unreadable author, but between Homer
and him there is about as much difference
as between Shakespeare and Quallon. Now, what
the Sanskrit scholars ought surely to do for us
is to state some theory whereby to account for
the fact that their favourite language contains
no literature worth perusal. There is neither
the poetry of the Greek nor the theosophy of
the Hebrew in Sanskrit. Hence we venture to
infer that there is some innate racial distinction
as yet undiscovered by the modern ethnologist.</p>

Blackwood and Sons.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Oliphant's delicate touch in social description
is too well known for it to be necessary
to dwell upon it here. She is one of the few
lady-novelists who improve as they go on; the
truth being that she has never sought to obtain
startling effects by absurd means, but has
always studied nature and human nature. In
'John,' re-published from <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>,
which is a novelette rather than a novel,
she is very felicitous. There is no more story
than Canning's knife-grinder had to tell: it is
a mere love-tale, 'Silly sooth,' as Shakespeare
hath it. John is a country parson's son, and
Kate is a banker's daughter, and she is thrown
from her horse near the parsonage, and has to
be taken there, and as she convalesces makes
sad havoc with poor John. A simple story,
but charming in its simplicity. The <i>situation</i>
is well conceived. Dr. Clifford is a worldly
person; his son John is utterly unworldly;
Crediton, the banker, is a plutocrat of the first
force; Kate is a spoilt child, who means to
have her own way in marriage. The end of it
all is easily conceivable; but the comedietta is
played out with consummate skill, especially by
its heroine. We are less interested in her lover
than in her; and although doubtless Mrs.
Oliphant is an able nomenclator, we venture
to think that the book would have more properly
represented its title if that title had been
'Kate.'</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>From Thistles&mdash;Grapes?</i> By Mrs. <span class="smcap">Eiloart</span>,
Author of 'The Curate's Discipline,' 'Meg,'
&amp;c., &amp;c. In three vols. Richard Bentley,
Publisher in Ordinary to Her Majesty, New
Burlington-street.</p>

<p>Given a bundle of thistles, how many bunches
of grapes can it produce? Answer, none.
This theory Mrs. Eiloart seeks to develope to
its fullest extent; and, as a natural consequence,
we find the miserable 'grapes,' the
son, dangling by the neck on the scaffold whither
the testimony of the 'thistles,' the unnatural
parent, has sent him. There is nothing
so new or original in the plot of the novel as
the title, which with its note of interrogation at
once arouses the interest of the reader, an interest
which unfortunately goes little further
than the title-page. The scene is laid in a cathedral
town of England. Dr. Langton, a sanctimonious
divine, who has sown a terrible crop
of wild oats, as well as 'thistles' in his early
youth, excites the enmity of one of his parishioners,
a ragged vagabond, who has been convicted
of robbery, and sentenced to one month's
imprisonment in the county jail. The fellow,
having escaped from durance, is concealed by
the hero till morning, and succoured by the
heroine in a wood, where he lies helpless and
prostrate from a sprained ankle. But unfortunately
Dr. Langton, passing by that way, discovers
the poor wretch of whom the officers are
in pursuit, struggling amidst the brambles, and
instantly gives the alarm. The vagabond is
consequently conveyed back to prison, muttering
threats and imprecations against his betrayer.
From these preliminary incidents arise
a series of events, which, as they pass before
us, we salute with all the reverence to which
they are entitled from their venerable age and
ancient service. But notwithstanding the long
acquaintance we have enjoyed, in the land of
romance, with the greater part of the adventures
contained in these three volumes, some of
them appear before us with their old garments
so delicately patched and mended with Mrs.
Eiloart's new materials that we willingly forget
the proverbial weariness of the thrice-told tale.
The death of the heroine is well managed.
The kindness to the wretched offender, her
efforts to drag him out of the mire into the atmosphere
of intelligence and feeling, meets with
the usual result. He becomes deeply enamoured
of the sweet gentle girl according to
the brutal instincts of his nature, and pushes
her through the wood even to the brink of the
precipice down which she is bent on throwing
herself, maddened as she is with the discovery
of the hero's attachment to another. The
vagabond, whose brain is as usual muddled
with beer, suddenly becomes sobered at the
sight of her peril, and rushes forward to save
her. Seizing her by the folds of her dress, the
frail material gives way, and a portion of it remaining
in his hand and afterwards found in
his possession, becomes the circumstantial evidence,
which causes his arrest. Now the
thistles come forward to bear witness to having
beheld the frantic flight of the girl through
the wood, and the subsequent appearance of
the boor on the very spot where she had met
with her death. The testimony is crushing,
the offender is condemned to die, and mounts
the scaffold proclaiming his innocence. The
revelation of the relationship in which he stands
to his denouncer is made too late, and Dr. Langton
arrives with the proof of the young lady's
meditated suicide just in time to see his own
illegitimate son swing in mid-air as the drop
falls, and the shoutings of the crowd announce
that all is over. The perseverance and tenacity
of purpose which bear an author through the
labour of executing three goodly volumes unaided
in the task by incident, description, or
dialogue, are beyond all praise. '<i>Il est si facile
de ne point &eacute;crire</i>,' exclaims Boileau. But the
lady-writers of modern times evidently reverse
the saying&mdash;with them it far more difficult to
refrain.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>'Six Months Hence.'</i> Being Passages from
the Life of Maria <i>n&eacute;e</i> Secretan. Three
volumes. Smith, Elder and Co.</p>

<p>In the anonymous author of this story we
have, we suspect, a new writer of fiction,
and of considerable power. The novel is
mainly a psychological one&mdash;although full of
tragic incidents, and complicated in its plot.
Indeed, the story is constructed with a mechanical
ingenuity, which in the minuteness and
mosaic of its incidents, is not unworthy of the
author of the 'Lady in White.' The story is
told autobiographically by the heroine, in a
plain matter-of-fact way; full, however, of
psychological self-analysis that would do credit
to the author of 'Dr. Austin's Guests,' especially
in the delineation of Fortescue's madness.
The heroine enters upon a situation as governess
in the family of Mr. Armitage, of Harcourt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
Villa, Hastings; who, being left a widower,
with a son and daughter, Charles and
Helen, has married, a second time, a woman of
coarse nature and unscrupulous character, who
has one son, Fred, a little boy of six. A Mr.
Fortescue, an accomplished and wealthy young
man, is a constant visitor at the villa, and is the
presumptive lover of Helen, although he has
never declared his love. Helen, and Maria, the
governess, who are of the same age, become
fast friends; gradually, however, Mr. Fortescue
transfers his attentions to Maria, whose first
guilt consists in yielding to ambitious desires,
and permitting in herself and Mr. Fortescue
treachery to her friend. The incipient attachment
is strengthened by a long nursing of little
Fred, who meets with an accident; the rescue
of Maria from the tide by Mr. Fortescue precipitates
matters, and they are secretly engaged
to be married; two or three days before the
intended disclosure of the engagement, and a
few days before the intended marriage, Mr.
Armitage dies, having, through the machinations
of his wife, made an iniquitous will,
whereby little Fred is made his heir in the
event of his attaining the age of twenty-one;
should he die before that age, the estates revert
to the natural heir, no other provision being
made. Maria and Mr. Fortescue are married.
On the very week of their arrival at Dalemain
Castle, Mr. Fortescue's seat in Cumberland,
little Fred is murdered,&mdash;Mr. Fortescue being
absent from home on some business in another
part of Cumberland. Helen is suspected and
tried; then suspicion falls upon Charles, against
whom circumstantial evidence is strong, and
public indignation stronger still. The mob at
Lewes attempt to lynch him on the day of his
trial, and he receives injuries of which he dies.
In the meanwhile, Maria discovers that she has
married a maniac, who inherits the fatal taint
from his grandmother. In the event of such a
contingency, by the grandfather's will, the property
is to go to the next heir. Now comes
the struggle between Maria's cupidity and her
conscience; she tries to hide the fact of her
husband's insanity, and discovers that, under
a strong hallucination, he has been the murderer
of little Fred. Again a struggle between
selfishness and conscience&mdash;Helen is accused
of the murder, and Maria conceals the evidence
that will exculpate her, and, to put it out of
her power to save her, goes with her husband
into Switzerland; there she hears that the accusation
is transferred to Charles, whom she
has secretly but passionately loved. What
conscience would not do for Helen, love does
for Charles; she hastens to England with
proofs of his innocence, but arrives only in
time to see him die of the injuries received
from the mob. All this is told with great
power&mdash;the anatomy of selfishness in herself,
of madness in her husband, and of love in
Helen and Charles is very masterly, and almost
painfully minute. The story is one of intense
interest, and gives promise of another powerful
writer of fiction, who, notwithstanding the
feminine autobiography, and the minute analysis
of female passions, is, we suspect, of the
sterner sex.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>The Struggles of Brown, Jones, and Robinson</i>.
By One of the Firm. Edited by <span class="smcap">Anthony
Trollope</span>. Smith, Elder, and Co.</p>

<p>Mr. Trollope has, in this little <i>brochure</i>, essayed
the epic of modern advertising. The
following sentences epitomise the moral thereof:&mdash;Robinson,
<i>loquitur</i>&mdash;'Did you ever believe
an advertisement? Jones, in self-defence, protested
that he never had. And why should
others be more simple than you? No man, no
woman, believes them. They are not lies; for
it is not intended they should obtain credit.
I should despise the man who attempted to
build his advertisement on a system of facts,
as I should the builder who lays his foundation
on the sand. The groundwork of advertisement
is romance. It is poetry in its very
essence. Is Hamlet true?'</p>

<p>'I really do not know,' said Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>'There is no man, to my thinking, so false,'
continued Robinson, 'as he who in trade professes
to be true. He deceives, or endeavours
to do so. I do not. Advertisements are profitable;
not because they are believed, but
because they attract attention.'</p>

<p><i>Per contra.</i> 'The ticketing of goods at
prices below their value is not to our taste, but
the purchasing of such goods is less so. The
lady who will take advantage of a tradesman,
that she may fill her house with linen, or cover
her back with finery, at his cost, and in a manner
which her own means would not fairly permit,
is, in our estimation, a robber. Why is
it that commercial honesty has so seldom
charms for women? A woman who would
give away the last shawl from her back will
insist on smuggling her gloves through the
Custom-house. Is not the passion for cheap
purchases altogether a female mania? And
yet every cheap purchase&mdash;every purchase
made at a rate so cheap as to deny the vendor
his fair profit, is, in truth, a dishonesty&mdash;a dishonesty
to which the purchaser is indirectly a
party. Would that woman could be taught to
hate bargains! How much less useless trash
would there be in our houses, and how much
fewer tremendous sacrifices in our shops?'</p>

<p>Those who read in the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i>
this sketch of the advertising firm, its wonderful
puffs, and the sensations they caused in
Bishopsgate; with the unromantic, hard, business-like
match-making which is interwoven
with it, will remember with what a keen and
somewhat cynical satire, too much upon a dead
realistic level perhaps, the story is told. Those
who have not read it there, are recommended to
make themselves acquainted with it. It is but
'An Editor's Tale,' but its moral is wholesome
and timely.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>Mariette; or, Further Glimpses of Life in
France</i>. A Sequel to Marie. Bell and
Daldy.</p>

<p>This story of humble life in the French provinces
is intended as a sequel to that of 'Marie,'
and is a mere narrative of events occurring in
the daily existence of the humblest of serving
women, who reports the sayings and doings of
her masters, through the incidents, political and
municipal, occurring in the good town of Nantes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
where they reside. The book is amusing enough,
a sort of French country town chronicle, such a
record as Mrs. Gaskell would now and then give
us of English life under the same conditions;
there is nothing in it to stir the passions&mdash;nothing
to irritate or vex; but on the other hand,
nothing to soothe or calm the nerves. It resembles
a long unbroken chant, as if from the lips
of an aged crone, which neither commands the
attention of the listener nor prevents him from
bestowing it on anything else, and yet is regretted
when it is over, simply because the
scenes, the characters, the conversations are all
familiar to our memory, and hallowed by long
association. The little volume possesses one
charm of its own. It is written without the
smallest pretension, easy and simple in style,
and delicately subdued in sentiment, in keeping
with the character and station of the supposed
narrator.</p>

<p>In her new story, Mrs. Charles has ventured
to tread the oft-trodden paths of the age of the
Incarnation, and with a delicacy, grace, and
devout tenderness that perhaps none of her
predecessors have attained. The story opens
in Rome in the year <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 17. Its personages
are a captive German family, brought to Rome
by Germanicus&mdash;slaves in his household, first
becoming acquainted with the pagan life at
Rome, then with the heaving Jewish life,
which He who was Immanuel was stirring to
its depths. Jew and Roman, Greek and Christian
represent the various classes of contemporary
life. Mrs. Charles is too refined and reverent
an artist to bring us into the actual presence
of him who taught in Capernaum; but
we vividly feel and realize his life; and Siguna
and her children, Seivord and Hilda, and Laon,
the old Greek, and Cl&oelig;lia Diodora, the Roman
maiden, find its salvation. A more beautiful,
pellucid, and tender story has rarely been

<p class="hang p2"><i>Chips from a German Workshop.</i> By <span class="smcap">F. Max
Muller</span>, M.A., Foreign Member of the
French Institute, &amp;c. Vol. III., Essays
on Literature, Biography, and Antiquities.
Longmans, Green, and Co.</p>

<p>The first and second volumes of Mr. Max
M&uuml;ller's occasional essays on the subject of
comparative mythology, and on the so-called
science of religious development, received the
modest and quaint title of 'Chips from a German
Workshop.' Our author has given the
stress of his energy and the prime of his life to
great undertakings. His edition of the 'Rig-Veda,'
and now his elaborate translation and
interpretation of its hymns, have not prevented
his delivering important courses of lectures on
the Science of Language. The great assistance
he rendered to Baron Bunsen in his Oriental
and philological speculations has been abundantly
recognised by all students of the greater
works of Bunsen. But scientific scholarship
on this high scale has brought our author into
contact with other and allied themes of literary
research; and we find in the present volume a
reprint of sixteen additional essays, of varied
interest and merit, which greatly enhance our
idea of the wide extent of Mr. Max M&uuml;ller's
scholarship, and are, moreover, of a class which
may be safely commended to the general reader.
Comparative grammar is clearly the key which
this accomplished student of ancient and modern
languages is tempted to use on all occasions,
and for the solution of all puzzles, historical,
theological, political, and even scientific.
His keen and penetrating eye sees analogies,
histories, reaches of civilization, bonds and
bars of fellowship, in non-extant words, where
one less trained to the business would utterly
fail to discover them; and his linguistic omniscience
makes us, in our ignorance, not seldom
feel that he is too clever by half, and that his
conclusions come almost too 'pat' upon his
speculative theses. Be this as it may, we
thank him very heartily for the exceeding refreshment
and peculiar charm of this volume.
The three articles on 'Cornish Antiquities,' on
the question 'Are there Jews in Cornwall?'
and on 'the Insulation of St. Michael's Mount,'
which were written in 1867, form a trilogy of
extreme interest. We have seldom read anything
more perfect or complete in its way than
his demolition of Mr. Pengelly's plausible
theory, that the Cornish language was spoken
before the insulation of St. Michael's Mount,
in Cornwall, could have taken place; even
though, geologically speaking, that event must
be thrown back from 16,000 to 20,000 years.
His learned refutation of the idea that Jews
worked in the mines of Cornwall, in part effected
by the discovery of the true etymology
of the name of the town Marazion, on which so
much had been built, and his instructive exposition
of the nature and value of the Cornish
antiquities and language, will well repay perusal.</p>

<p>The gem of the volume is the eloquent and
affectionate tribute to the memory of Bunsen,
in the form of a review of his memoirs. To
these Max M&uuml;ller has now added a valuable
postscript, in a selection of some hundred letters
addressed to himself by the great scholar
and diplomatist. They are charged with kindly
and generous feeling, and with noble enthusiasm;
and they give fresh insight into Bunsen's
astounding activity, far-reaching glance,
and prodigious range of literary endeavour.
They would many of them be more intelligible
if they were read in their proper place in his
biography; but the perusal of them recalls the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
zest with which three years ago the memoirs of
this great man were devoured rather than read.
We are not surprised that M. M&uuml;ller should
say, 'It has been my good fortune in life to
have known many men whom the world calls
great philosophers, statesmen, scholars, artists,
and poets; but take it all in all, take the full
humanity of the man, I have never seen, and I
shall never see his like again.'</p>

<p>One of the essays to which we would direct
special attention is that on the language and
poetry of Schleswig-Holstein. The biographical
articles on Schiller, and Wilhelm M&uuml;ller,
and some of the shorter 'chips' on 'Ye
Schyppe of Fools,' 'Old German Love-songs,'
and on 'A German Traveller in England, A.D.
1598,' are racy, and highly entertaining.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>The World of Moral and Religious Anecdote;
Illustrations and Incidents gathered from
the Words, Thoughts, and Deeds in the Lives
of Men, Women, and Books</i>. By <span class="smcap">Edwin
Paxton Hood</span>. Hodder and Stoughton.</p>

<p>Mr. Hood is a man who reads everything, and
who, making allowance for such slight inaccuracies
as are characteristic of voracious readers,
forgets nothing that he has read. It would be
difficult to name a man better qualified to compile
a volume of anecdotes. We wish, however,
he would not call Samuel Bailey, the
thoughtful author of the 'Essays on the Formation
and Publication of Opinions,' Bail<i>lie</i>.
Eccentricities of this kind are frequent in Mr.
Hood's writings, and not easy to be accounted
for.</p>

<p>The volume published by Mr. Hood, under
the more general title 'The World of Anecdote,'
has met with a reception so favourable,
that he has published this companion volume,
'The World of Religious Anecdote,' filled with
anecdotes of religious men or things, gathered
from a very wide circle of religious biography
and history, and from all imaginable miscellaneous
sources&mdash;from a quarterly review to a
newspaper. Mr. Hood does not exaggerate
the importance and significance of anecdote,
either in history or biography; if exactly told,
such incidents as constitute anecdote, indicate
the movement or the man, more truthfully than
formal disquisition. We do not pretend to
have read through Mr. Hood's volume&mdash;this
would be a task, less arduous only than to read
through a dictionary&mdash;but we have read enough
of it cordially to commend it as a repertory of
many things that are both new and good, and
of some that are neither.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>The Essays of an Optimist</i>. By <span class="smcap">John William
Kaye</span>. Smith, Elder, and Co.</p>

<p>Mr. Kaye tells us that he had no particular
design when writing these papers; no purpose,
that is, of illustrating any special philosophy.
They were not to him a serious work&mdash;they
were 'holiday tasks, written by snatches, and
sent off piece by piece as they were written;
the loose thoughts of a loose thinker, desultory,
discursive,' written away from books, 'in country
inns, or sea-side lodgings, or other strange
places far away from home.' Criticism is
exonerated from dealing in any serious way
with a book so produced. Literature is not
thus achieved. Cameo-cutting should be as
artistic and patient as <i>genre</i> painting. Mr.
Kaye is pleasantly garrulous, and intelligently
superficial. He writes as one would write good
letters; and what he writes is very pleasant to
read. He throws the regulating good sense of
a sober well-informed man upon such matters
as Holidays, Work, Success, Growing Old, Toleration,
&amp;c. He has done and can do good
work; therefore we accept with a certain degree
of interest these 'chips.'</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>A Book of Golden Thoughts</i>. By <span class="smcap">Henry
Attwell</span>, Knight of the Order of the Oak
Crown, &amp;c. Macmillan and Co.</p>

<p>This is one of the most charming volumes of
the Golden Treasury series. The author, with
rare discernment and fine taste, has selected
the richest, sweetest thoughts of our greatest
and wisest teachers on a marvellous variety of
themes, but all tending in the direction of high
spiritual culture. The apothegms or longer
passages extracted from French or German
writers are translated with delicate tact and
placed in an appendix. The words of Pascal&mdash;<i>J'ecrirai
ici mes pens&eacute;es sans ordre, et non pas
peut-&ecirc;tre dans une confusion sans dessein: c'est
le veritable ordre, et qui marquera toujours
mon objet par le d&eacute;sordre m&ecirc;me</i>&mdash;are placed at
the head of the volume. It would take a long
time to try and unravel the design of Mr. Attwell,
but whoever wishes to have the choicest
words of Bacon, Pascal, Montesquieu, Goethe,
Ruskin, Helps, and many others, may find
them here brought together into small compass,
and presented in a very attractive form.</p>

<p>These issues are not quite according to the
Society's programme in their report of January
last, which, stated that three or four other
works besides the first part of the 'Bruce'
were in the press for their extra series of 1870,
and made no mention of the volume which Mr.
Furnivall has edited. Indeed, the opportunity
for his undertaking this work did not, he tells
us, occur until February, when he purchased
an early copy of the Dyetary at Mr. Corser's
sale.</p>

<p>Dr. Andrew Boorde or Borde, was a Carthusian
monk of Henry the Eighth's time, who
'was dyspensyd of the religion,' whatever that
may mean&mdash;a point obscure to Mr. Furnivall&mdash;travelled
over a great part of Europe, and returned
to practise as a physician, having for his
patient the Duke of Norfolk, when that great
noble was in the Royal favour. Of several
works which the Doctor wrote, Mr. Furnivall
has printed two; in a preface and epilogue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
which he is pleased to style 'Forewords and
Hindwords,' are collected many particulars of
the author's life, and long extracts from others
of his writings. 'The Introduction of Knowledge'
is a book of travel, partly in rhyme, giving
characteristics and specimens of the languages
of the several countries the author had
visited. The Dyetary is a book of hygi&egrave;ne,
containing many prescriptions which modern
physicians would approve. Both tracts abound
in quaint, curious, and shrewd remarks. One
of the Doctor's last works was a treatise on
beards, which he seems to have condemned,
and to have advocated shaving. For this Mr.
Furnivall, who 'left off the absurdity some
three years before his neighbours,' thinks him
'a noodle,' as it seems did 'Barnes, whoever
he may be,' whose defence of the Berde is here
printed. There is, however, some reason to
suppose that the learned editor thinks Barnes
was a noodle also. The subject is clearly a
pet with him.</p>

<p>The 'Bruce' is well-known, and has been
frequently reprinted, editions having appeared
as lately as 1856 and 1869. The last was issued
after Mr. Skeat had begun his labours;
but its character was not such as to lead the
Society to desire less the completion of their
own edition. About half the poem is now
printed. Mr. Skeat's preface and glossarial index
await the publication of the second part.
John Barlowe was the contemporary of
Wycliffe, Chaucer, and Gower, and his poem
is a worthy member of the group of noble
works which were the first fruits of English
literature. It may be called English, now that
Scotland and England have a common inheritance,
though it is a Scot's story of his countrymen's
resistance to the dictation and encroachment
of the English king, and the Archdeacon
would doubtless have scorned and repudiated
the epithet. The subject-matter of the poem
is a great one. It tells how, on the death of
King Alexander, a doubt arose, whether, according
to the true law of inheritance, the
Bruce or the Baliol ought to succeed to the
throne; how the dispute was referred to the
arbitration of the English Edward,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>how, instead of judging loyally, he seized the
opportunity for insisting on his own claim to a

<p class="hang"><i>Tales from Chaucer in Prose, designed chiefly
for the use of Young Persons</i>. By <span class="smcap">Charles
Cowden Clarke</span>. Second Edition, carefully
Revised. Lockwood and Co.</p>

<p>Mr. Clarke is a veteran in the field of Shakespearian
literature; although this is not necessarily
a qualification for the exposition of
Chaucer, who lived two centuries and a quarter
earlier, and at the very dawn of our literature:
the scholarly character of his Shakespearian
work, however, is a presumption in favour of a
worthy presentation of Chaucer. The work
itself justifies this presumption. The first of
these volumes is an expurgated, modernized,
and accentuated edition of Chaucer. Scholars,
or perhaps we should say, pedants, will likely
enough turn up their noses at this, and pour
upon Mr. Clarke the ridicule that has been the
meed of Bowdler; but Chaucer and Shakespeare
stand in different relations to modern
popular readers. To such the archaic language
of Chaucer makes him simply unintelligible,
while his coarseness absolutely excludes him
<i>puerisque virginibus</i>. No idolatry of English
literature can warrant a parent in putting
Chaucer as he is into the hands of his children.
Nor can much moral benefit accrue to anyone
from his perusal. If, therefore, Chaucer is to
be a popular book at all, to be read by any but
scholars, both processes are essential. Mr.
Clarke has every desirable qualification for the
work, which demands both a scholar and an
artist. The accentuation of the rhythm too
will be a great help to unpractised readers.
This edition of Chaucer may be put into the
hands of young people and modest women,
with the assurance also that it will be easily
understood and thoroughly enjoyed. We trust
that through it our first and one of our greatest
poets will be introduced into schools and homes,
and win a popularity hitherto denied him.</p>

<p>The second volume is an attempt to reproduce
the Tales of Chaucer in modern prose
after the manner of Lamb's 'Tales from
Shakespeare.' This is a far more arduous undertaking.
Mr. Clarke tells us that he has endeavoured
to render the poetry in as easy prose
as he could, without at the same time destroying
the poetical description and strong natural
expressions of the author. Some of the long
discussions are omitted, as of course is all that
is offensive in coarse expression or allusion.
The task has been difficult. 'I was,' Mr.
Clarke says, 'to be at one and the same time
modernly antique, prosaically poetic, and comprehensively
concise.' That he has succeeded
in so large a degree is very high merit. We
trust his little volume will be widely read.

<p class="hang p2"><i>The Origin, and Development of Religious Belief.</i>
By <span class="smcap">S. Baring-Gould</span>, M.A. Part II.&mdash;Christianity.
Rivingtons.</p>

<p>We have already called the attention of our
readers to the first part of this remarkable
work, in which the writer, taking the standpoint
of positive science and the facts of
human nature, endeavoured to account for the
developments of religious belief in all ages and
places, and uttered his conviction that they all
correspond to some necessity and quality of
human nature. He then hazarded the opinion
that the true and absolute religion would take
account of, and embody, and satisfy, the cravings
expressed in the strange worship and religious
ideas of all peoples. He has now pursued
his inquiry into the positive dicta of
Christian theology, and seeks to show that
they rest on facts anterior both to the text of
Scripture and the very existence of the Divine
Society. Revelation, if it exists at all, must
take up into itself all the varieties not only of
Mosaism or heathenism, but of polytheism, of
idolatry, fetishism, and mysticism, because
these and many others are facts of human nature,
and have had a great part to play in the
development and progress of human thought.
Christianity, to our author, is true&mdash;and by
Christianity he appears to mean the whole
dogmatic and hierarchical and social edifice of
Catholicism, because it contains in itself the
utterance of all truths. All other religions and
all sects and schism of the one Church, so far
as they hold positive truth, hold only what the
Church holds; their negations are to his mind
'nothing,' and are destitute, therefore, of all
vital power. The Quaker, the Lutheran, the
Anglican, the Greek, the Presbyterian, the
modern Christian philosopher, not to say the
Pagan, the Arian, the Pelagian, the Donatist,
grasped severally and forcibly some one truth;
perhaps one-half of the antinomy presenting
itself in some great synthesis. Let this be
granted, and, according to Mr. B. Gould, Catholicism
held the same great truth. It may
be found embedded in her system, taught with
greater explicitness there than by the sectary;
but each of these has <i>denied</i> some truth or
placitum of Catholicism, and its negation has
been nothing, has added nothing to the value
of belief as positive truth. Yet with all this,
the author falls foul of Rome at a hundred
points. The union between the Church and
the temporal power is denounced with unmeasured
terms; the Papacy is a violation and
a 'negation' of the <i>&oelig;cumenicity</i> of the Church,
and the encyclical of Pius IX. comes in for a
series of terrific blows. The Inquisition and
the persecuting spirit which arose in Rome under
the union of sacred and secular powers, is
treated with as sincere a condemnation as is
every form of Protestantism. Still further,
when the author comes to deal with the evidence
for the Incarnation, on which his whole
theory turns, he disposes of every vestige of
proof which may be supposed to linger in the
New Testament in favour of this stupendous
mystery of grace, and this 'conciliation of all
antinomies.' The chapter on 'The Evidence
of the Incarnation' is a feeble <i>rechauff&eacute;</i> of the
most ultra type of modern scepticism. Miracles
and prophecy, the inspiration, authenticity, and
genuineness of the Gospels, the evidential value
of specific occurrences in the life of Christ, all
go to the wall. Much is made of discrepancies
and contradictions, of the silence of contemporary
historians, and all the rest of it, with
which we are so familiar; and our author's
conclusion is, that there is no evidence worthy
of the name for the chief fact on which the
whole of the religious development of Christianity
turns. Relinquishing every proof of
the divinity of Christ derivable from the New
Testament as less than useless, the grounds on
which he calls for a belief in the incarnation of
God in Christ (who, by the way, need not ever
have existed as an historical character at all)
are, that 'such a union of divinity and humanity
is necessary to me, that my nature may
find its complete religious satisfaction;' 'such
a dogma alone supplies an adequate basis for
morals, establishes the rights of man on a
secure foundation, enables man to distinguish
between authority and force, conciliates my
double nature, rational and sentimental, and
my double duties, egoistic and altruistic, and
supplies an adequate incentive to progress.'</p>

<p>These several points furnish the matter of
several chapters; and while it must be observed
here that Mr. Baring-Gould's 'negations,' as
well as those of other sectaries, are 'nothing,'
and his condemnations and denials of many
positions for which the Catholic Christian
would be prepared to die, put him, in spite of
himself, among the most extreme left of the
Hegelian school, yet his arguments on the
worth of the dogma of Incarnation, from his
own point of view, deserve serious consideration.
After his numerous indications of a
negative criticism and spirit as hardy and
audacious as could be well imagined, he sets
to work with a will, to blaspheme Protestantism
as the negation of moral truths. His
monstrous perversions of Luther's and Calvin's
position merit severe castigation. Thus,
'Calvin denied free-will, and therefore denied
duty.' Can he have read the 'Institutes?'
The statement 'that Reformers denied the
holiness of God,' with Jewel's 'Apology,' or
any of the Protestant symbols in his hand, is
too flagrant a violation of common fairness.
The charge in this chapter against Protestants,
that they deny or negative the Personal Christ,
and in a later chapter, that they have only a
dead Christ and not a present Christ to worship
or love, comes with a bad grace from one
who has thrown away the evidence of the existence
or divinity of Christ as an historical
fact. He appears to glory in the sacramental
system of the Romanist, and assures us that
the Protestant sacraments are reduced to two,
and these are not baptism and the Lord's
Supper, but the 'Ministry' and the 'Bible;'
the latter of which, in its sacramental character,
he pleasingly describes for his purpose, as
just so much 'washed-up rags and black
treacle stains,' an euphuism for the printed
page, which is the <i>mat&eacute;riel</i> for the communication
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
of such truth and reality as we poor
destitute beings possess. We are content.
The mighty Word itself, with all its power to
kindle life and instruct intelligence, to stir the
affections, and discern even the thoughts and
intents of the heart, is graciously communicated
to us by the printed page, and by the living
voice of men charged with the Holy Ghost;
and for an actual communication of the living
Christ to our true nature, it is on an infinitely
higher level than that which can only reach
our emotional nature through the medium of
our alimentary canal and gastric juices. When
our author holds up to heartless Protestants
certain acts of special worship which Cardinal
Wiseman described so feelingly and poetically,
we can hardly refrain from telling him that
such Cremorne splendours of religious awe,
such blendings of fetishism and wax-candles
with the stupendous conception of the ever-present
Christ, will have little effect upon those
whose intellectual, moral, and sensuous nature
have been brought into their due relation with
each other, who know the Christ, who love
Him and could die for him.</p>

<p>There is much that is worthy of profound
consideration in Mr. Baring-Gould's positive
assertions with reference to the Incarnation
and the Atonement, the dogma of immortality
and the Christian sacrifice; but he has a
strange habit of putting a few transcendental
propositions one after the other, mounting up
from a 'positive' basis to something like
'Catholic doctrine,' and then calling his string
of dogmas, demonstration. He appears perfectly
rabid in his hatred of Protestantism and
Protestants, in his dislike of the doctrine of
the Atonement, as expounded in every phase
of evangelical Christianity; and he never
wearies of accusing Protestants of worshipping
a dead Christ, because they cannot, after his
Hegelian fashion, accept the Tridentine dogma
of transubstantiation and eucharistic sacrifice.
With all his rapturous admiration of the
Church and denunciation of Protestants, it is
sufficiently amusing to find him perpetually&mdash;when
he wants to give high utterance to his
most enthusiastic dream&mdash;driven to quote the
poetry of Sectaries; and once he is so far left
to himself as actually to make that heretic,
Isaac Watts, do him some service, and say for
him one of his sweetest thoughts. After all
said and done, we find him still outside the
Roman Church, and the next thing we may
hear is, that his interesting, eloquent, and
original book is placed in the 'Index.' There
is surely scarcely a position of high importance
adopted by him which would not be repudiated
by a Catholic theologian.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>The Athanasian Creed, and its usage in the
English Church: an Investigation, as to the
General Object of the Creed, and the Growth
of prevailing Misconceptions concerning it.</i>
A Letter to Very Rev. <span class="smcap">W. F. Hook</span>, D.D.,
from <span class="smcap">C. A. Swainson</span>, D.D. Rivingtons.</p>

<p>This letter is extremely interesting, coming,
as it does, on the morrow after the publication
of the Report of the Ritual Commissioners,
and following the courageous articles of Dean
Stanley and Professor Maurice in the <i>Contemporary
Review</i>, and the long discussion of the
subject in the <i>Guardian</i>. Dr. Swainson is
well entitled, by his prolonged studies in this
department of ecclesiastical literature, to be
heard in defence of the symbol of Athanasius.
The upshot of his argument is, that it is a
'hymn,' and not a 'creed.' Here he does but
re-echo the language of Dr. J. H. Newman,
Mr. Maurice, and others. He conceives, however,
that he has proved that it was in the first
instance used to prepare candidates for baptism,
and that the damnatory clauses do not
belong to it in essence, and have not the same
authenticity or value as the exposition given
in it of the Catholic faith; that their meaning
is not intended to cover every individual
clause of the exposition, but to refer to the
Catholic faith as a whole; that they merely assert
the grand distinction which faith makes
between those that are being saved and those
that are perishing for ever in the darkness of
unbelief; that the inaccuracies of the English
translation are due to the influence of the
Greek translation of Bryling, and to the obscurity
introduced by Luther's version of it
into German; that it ought to be 'sung,' in a
true translation, as an addition to the psalmody,
and not in place of the Apostles' Creed;
that as 'the articles were never intended originally
to be made a test to be subscribed or
enlarged from that point of view,' the reference
to the Athanasian Creed in the Articles does
not bind us to believe that every clause in it is
agreeable to the word of God, any more than a
multitude of other propositions in the Articles,
about which it would be absurd to make a
similar assertion. These various refinements
will not avail to reconcile the Anglican clergy
to continue much longer the use of a formulary
which, though certain portions of it may, by
antiquarian scholars, be severed in thought
from the rest, does yet assume to the majority
of those that are called to 'sing' or 'say' it,
the appearance of a homogeneous whole. Dr.
Newman's description of it as a war-song of the
Church, is unquestionably true; if so, it does
condemn, in the language of triumphant dogmatism,
the opinions of Arian, Sabellian, and
Apollinarian, as well as those who repudiate
the Double Procession of the Holy Spirit; and
it declares that, without doubt, those who hold
such opinions shall perish for ever. Scarcely
one in a thousand of the Anglican clergy can
believe in the obvious literal interpretation of
the symbol as a whole.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>The History and Literature of the Israelites,
according to the Old Testament and the
Apocrypha.</i> By <span class="smcap">C. de Rothschild</span> and <span class="smcap">A.
de Rothschild</span>. Two vols. Longmans,
Green and Co.</p>

<p>The first element of interest to us in this
work is, that it is a history of the Jewish people
and their literature, by members of their
own nation and faith. It must ever be of
great interest and of great importance to Christian
students of the Old Testament to see the
views of it taken by Jews, who certainly do
not bring to it the Christian preconceptions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
which so often overlay and perplex its interpretation.
If, as we think, the interpretation
of the modern Jew errs through his refusal to
see the relations of its predictions and types to
Jesus of Nazareth, it is certain that the interpretation
of Christians often errs through the
excess of Christian allusion which they imagine
themselves to find there. One way of correcting
the latter is to see how intelligent, pious, and
conscientious Jewish interpreters look at it.
Many things are placed by them in natural
lights, which are not the less artificial in Christian
hands, because Christian thought and
meaning are imported into them. The Messrs.
Rothschild, who claim the conjoint authorship
of the book, are accomplished and devout men,
and are remarkably free from polemical one-sidedness.
A chaste and gentle elegance of
style, illumined with quiet lights of a poetic
but restrained imagination, make the volumes
very pleasant to read. The work, moreover,
is popular in form. Its critical power is not
great, and the criticism that there is, is latent
rather than formal, and is exhibited in its results
rather than in its processes. It is sufficient,
if not to determine great controverted
questions, yet to give intelligence to the quiet
assumption of conclusions. Nothing is debated,
everything is assumed and affirmed as
unquestionable truth, although there are indications
that the writers are aware of the positions
of modern criticism.</p>

<p>The first volume is a simple recast of the
Old Testament story; the ordinary conclusions
of popular orthodoxy are accepted. It makes
no pretensions to the rectification and reconstruction
of Ewald or Stanley; Ewald, indeed,
is not once referred to. This volume, therefore,
which completes the history, calls for no remark,
except that it is written freshly and
pleasantly. The second volume, which deals
with Hebrew literature, presents many more
points for criticism. The writers have arrived
at conclusions, some of which are warranted
by the most authoritative judgments of modern
scholarship; others of which are so far from
this, that it was almost incumbent upon the
authors to justify their assumption of them.
They are such as these,&mdash;that there were two
Isaiahs, the first living down to the time of
Josiah, the second a hundred and fifty years
later in the time of Cyrus&mdash;the one the prophet
of prosperity, the other of adversity; that
the Messianic prophecies of the latter, those
contained in the fifty-third chapter for instance,
had reference to contemporary martyrs; that
the traditions of Jonah, the fretful prophet,
were handed down through many generations,
until they were embodied in their Biblical
form by some able writer of the Babylonian
period; the writers, however, repudiate the
idea of its being a legend, and contend for its
historical character&mdash;that the book of Daniel
was written about the year <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 160; that the
canonical book of Psalms was ever used or intended
to be used 'as a kind of liturgy of the
Jewish Church,' and 'that the poems were
made to serve this purpose, however different
their original object might have been;' that the
book of Job was an imaginative drama, or
dialogue, written about the Babylonian period,
constructed to prove the true doctrine of human
calamity; that the book of Ecclesiastes
was written 'in the Persian, if not in the Macedonian
period,' and that the author 'put his
ideas very appropriately into the mouth of
King Solomon;' that the 'Song of Solomon'
was 'written not long after the death of Solomon,
by a poet living in the Northern Kingdom,'
was supposed to be the production of
Solomon himself, and 'naturally believed to
have a religious tendency,' and that through
this misconception it obtained its place in the
Canon.</p>

<p>As the writers give no reasons for their assumptions,
it is impossible to indicate the reasons
of our agreement with them or difference
from them; we content ourselves with remarking,
that the absence of reasons in matters
so greatly controverted, deprives the
volume of scholarly character and critical
value. We can only say that, taking it for
what it is, it is an intelligently and agreeably
written book. Although making no pretensions
to the ability or historical power of
Stanley's 'Jewish Church,' it does not fall
into any of his great assumptions. The general
remarks on the office and character of the
Prophets, and on the schools of the Prophets,
are very meagre and feeble compared
with the chapters of Dr. Payne Smith,
or of Dean Stanley. The work, indeed, must
be commended as simply a popular and uncritical
reproduction from a Jewish point of
view of the Old Testament story.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>Present Day Papers on Prominent Questions
in Theology.</i> Edited by the Right Reverend
<span class="smcap">Alexander Ewing</span>, D.C.L., Bishop of
Argyll and the Isles. Strahan and Co.</p>

<p>These pamphlets have been published separately,
and subsequently collected into a
volume. The first bears the title 'The Atonement,'
by the Rev. Wm. Law, a reprint of
that great writer's 'Dialogue on the Atonement,'
with an elaborate introduction; the
second, by the editor, is on 'the Eucharist;'
the third to the sixth are anonymous, under
the titles 'The Rule of Faith,' 'The Present
Unbelief,' 'Words for Things,' and 'Meditations
and Prayers;' the seventh is a translation of
Luther's theses on 'Justification by Faith,' by
the Rev. J. Wace. It is impossible to deal
with these papers separately in the compass of
a brief notice. One strong spirit pervades almost
the whole of them. The burden of several
is to charge upon Evangelical doctrine the
entire blame of the 'present unbelief,' to represent
that which we hold to be the essence
of the Gospel of Christ as little better than
blasphemous misunderstanding of God, as
immoral, as defamatory to the true nature of
God and the work of Christ. It is urged that
Socinians and infidels would have had their
deadliest weapon wrenched from their hands,
if schoolmen and theologians had not perverted
the Gospel by representing the Atonement of
Christ as a means adopted to reconcile the
Father to his rebellious children, propitiate His
wrath, or satisfy His justice. We quite agree
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
so far as this with Mr. Law, and with the spirit
of several of the pamphleteers. If the
Church of Christ had been converted to the
view of Christ's work held by the Socini and
their followers, such disbelievers would have
gained a great victory. The doctrine of 'substitution'
is the <i>b&ecirc;te noire</i> of these writers.
Whatever else they attempt to explain away
or refute or repudiate, this hated doctrine
comes in for condemnation. The editor, in
his paper on the Eucharist, devotes great
space to show that the 'basis of morality is
overthrown by the idea of a substituted or
equivalent righteousness, ... all true conception
of the righteousness and holiness of
God is lost, and we are only saved from profanity
... by our non-observance of its real
nature.' To 'accept the sacrifice of the Son'
in lieu of man's righteousness, or in place
of man's punishment, 'is a terrible misconception,'
changing 'all that we naturally know
and believe about God, as good and right, into
darkness.' The paper on the 'Present Unbelief,'
which turns on man's indisposition to
recognise the self-evidencing revelation of
God, and propounds much wise and true remark
on the undue reverence paid by men and
Churches to the logical processes once needed
for special combat with evil, but now no
longer useful, tells us that 'the definitions of
God too often among ourselves, of God under
the name of Christ Jesus, or the anointed
Saviour, have been too similar to the heathen&mdash;to
Saturn devouring his children, painted,
no doubt, in milder colours, and clothed in
decent cloud, but very near the old heathen
conception, the old pictures of the Greeks.'
'God was not only in danger, but lost by such
a belief.' The author of the paper on 'the Rule
of Faith,' after much vague declamation and
mystical enthronement of the inner life, says
what is very excellent on the fact 'that the
proof of revelation being true from the character
of its operation, is the highest kind of
proof, and is not liable to the accidents which
affect other or external evidence.' He lays
great emphasis on that inner verification of revealed
truth which also makes it to be revelation
to each man. 'The God of another is not
my God; He is not my God by authority; I
must be the authority myself.' After developing
the older 'rule of faith,' as understood by
the writer, and saying some useful though not
very satisfactory or clear things about the
canon of Scripture, he endeavours to show that
the old 'rule of faith and practice in Christ
has been essentially altered.' The climax of
the offence of modern theology is represented
here and elsewhere in these papers as a transformation
of the statements, 'God so loved the
world that He gave His Son for it,' into 'God
so loved his Son as to give the world for Him.'
What the writer means we are at a loss to
understand, but he actually tells us, with a
very grave and solemn look, that 'in the
theology of substitution the way is turned into
the end,' 'darkness is brought in at the centre,'
God's 'love for man, as such, and individuals,
as such, was lost sight of, and the soul left to
a conventional relationship with Him which
left it entirely outside, and from whence it
could draw no nourishment.' All we can say
here is, that the author does not understand
the alphabet of the doctrine of substitution, or
has wilfully misrepresented it. The introduction
to the reprint of William Law's dialogue
is full of these misconceptions, and seems utterly
blind to the mighty powers of the new life
which, in the reformed theology, are the direct
form in which the justification of the soul by
faith in Christ's sacrifice becomes a matter of
experience or consciousness. The paper on
'Words for Things' is largely occupied with
the same theme. That man should not suffer
to the full the consequences of his sins in this
world and the next seems, we suppose, to these
writers a fearful violation of order; that the
work of Christ should be adapted to save a
man from his sins by guaranteeing and assuring
him of the Father's forgiveness is incomprehensible
to them. To us this state of mind
is only explicable on the supposition that these
writers cannot have felt the awfulness, hideousness
and peril of sin against the irresistible
order in the midst of which we are placed.
Christianity seems to us a very worthless thing
if this key-note of its melody, this key-stone of
its masonry be abstracted. From Confucius to
Marcus Antoninus, from Seneca to Lord Herbert
of Cherbury, from English Deists to French
Positivists, we are <i>told</i> by sages and philosophers
of all kinds to be good and self-sacrificing,
to love God and our neighbour, and do
justice and love mercy, and that all will be
well. Leave out of Christianity the 'grace'
that, to a broken heart and to a mind conscious
of guilt, comes not only with the Divine life
that makes a man a new creature, but with the
assured conviction that the order of God's
universe, the will of the Father, the justice of
His rule, are manifested in His infinite love to
the world through the death of His Son; leave
out the sublime truth that pervades the whole
revelation, and then the Bible and the Christ
have little more to tell us than we can find in
enlightened heathenism and pagan philosophy.
There is much in these papers of which we
cordially approve, and for which we feel grateful;
but this dead-set at what seems to us the
heart of Christianity wounds and distresses
us. Mr. Wace's translation of Luther's theses
is pitched in another key, and deserves separate
treatment.</p>

<p>We anticipate great advantage from the
translation of these two excellent manuals.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
We are learning in this country to value 'historical
theology' and the genesis and development
of Christian ideas. Many efforts
have been made to present to the student the
first stages and earliest forms of this wondrous
element of religious thought. Neander in his
'History of the Planting of the Christian
Church,' Reuss in his 'Histoire de la Th&eacute;ologie
Chr&eacute;tienne,' and Dr. Bernard in his Bampton
Lecture, have made us familiar with the fact
that the teaching of the New Testament,
though resulting in glorious harmony, is yet
not homogeneous, and reveals throughout a
progress from less to more&mdash;from germinant
seeds to rich efflorescence, from mysterious reticence
to open secrets, from fundamental
principles to elaborate and systematic detail.
The peculiar type of doctrine conspicuous in
the Synoptic Gospels differs from the spirit and
burden of the fourth gospel. The Petrine doctrine
is not identical either with Pauline or
Johannine theology. We are, perhaps, too apt
to explain the language of James by that of
Paul, or both by that of John, without sufficiently
taking into account the specific teaching
of each Evangelist and each Apostle. Dr.
Oosterzee's 'Biblical Theology' presents, in
small compass, the results of much careful
study, and seeks, at each stage of the inquiry,
to place the student in relation with the authors
of the New Testament respectively, and
with them alone for the time being. The references
to literature are ample, and various
points of stimulating inquiry are suggested.
The author does not go very deeply into the
separate positions, nor does he attempt any
elaborate exegesis of the Scriptures cited in
proof of the induction he makes. The Evangelical
bias of the inquiry is not concealed, and
his summaries of doctrine and the higher
unity which he claims for the somewhat divergent
forms, reveal very clearly the dogmatic
tendencies of his own investigations.
We can most cordially commend this work&mdash;especially
to those who have not access to
larger and more voluminous treatises&mdash;as an
admirable compendium of Biblical theology,
and a valuable preliminary to all honest study
of scientific and dogmatic theology.</p>

<p>The second work mentioned above pursues
the same general theme, and contrasts the
Biblical theology of the New Testament with
exegesis on the one hand and systematic
divinity on the other. This manual is a translation
by Mr. G. H. Venables of the fourth
German edition of the late Dr. Schmid's work
as edited by Dr. Weiz&auml;cker, and is a far more
elaborate treatise than that of Dr. Oosterzee.
It is divided into two parts, the one a development
of the teaching of Jesus, and the other
an exposition of the teaching of the Apostles.
The first part is preceded by an historical
review of the life of Jesus, and the second by
a fruitful and suggestive sketch of the lives of
the Apostles. The strength of learning and high
analytical powers of the author are reserved
for the doctrinal review, and very beautifully
does he bring forth the teaching of our Lord
under the three divisions&mdash;(<i>a</i>) the glorification
of the Father in the Son, involving the full
sublime teaching of Christ with reference to
the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; (<i>b</i>) the redemption
of man, including the object of
redemption, man and the world, and the subject
of redemption in all His relations; and (<i>c</i>) the
whole teaching of Christ about the kingdom of
God, which is identified with the Church; there
the author reveals his sacramentarian proclivities,
and his high idea of the function of the
Church and development of the kingdom both
in this world, and that which is to come. In
developing the teaching of the Apostles, his
chief point is that that of James and Peter
presents Christianity as in living unity with the
Old Testament, and that of Paul and John in
its fundamental distinction from the Old Testament.
Great care and skill are shown in showing
how the teaching of Paul and John roots
itself in the previous teaching of Jesus, and the
result of the entire discussion affords high
subsidiary proof of the unity of the New
Testament, the authenticity of the later as well
as the earlier of Paul's Epistles, and the
fundamental identity of doctrine in the Apocalypse
and fourth Gospel.</p>

<p>Dr. J. P. Thompson of New York, in the
third work mentioned above, has confined himself
to the high, grand, noble theme of illustrating
the 'theology of Christ.' He takes, as we
think, higher and broader ground in his illustration
of the 'kingdom of God' than either Dr.
Oosterzee or Dr. Schmid, and admirably states
the truth when he represents the Church as a
form of the kingdom of God, embracing the
whole 'commonwealth of believing souls who,
through all diversities of race, language, and
ecclesiastical institution, fraternise in the love
of Christ.' Dr. Thompson developes the teaching
of Christ under a great variety of themes
which are not concatenated in any such classification
as Dr. Schmid's, though they traverse
much of the same ground. Such topics
as 'prayer,' 'providence,' and 'eschatology,'
occupy much of the space. The exposition is
wise, candid, and eloquent.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>A Dictionary of Doctrinal and Historical
Theology.</i> Edited by the Rev. <span class="smcap">John Henry
Blunt</span>, M.A., F.S.A. L&mdash;Z. Rivingtons.</p>

<p>We see no reason for modifying the judgment
of Mr. Blunt's Dictionary which we ventured
to pronounce upon the first section of it. His
extensive knowledge is beyond all doubt, and
his indefatigable industry beyond all praise.
We give him all credit for both painstaking
and conscientiousness; but he sorely lacks the
scholarly faculty of using his knowledge in a
dispassionate way. Rash assertion, hasty generalization,
partial and illogical inference, disfigure
every page of his Dictionary. Mr.
Blunt is fairly carried away by his sacramentarian
theories; they possess him like a
fever, and affect both his vision and his judgment.
Above most of his brethren even, and
that is saying very much, he infuses a polemic
into every scrap of antiquarian fact that he
can collect, and into every particle of reasoning
that his ingenuity can devise. We are
aware that a statement like this is a very grave
accusation, and that it can be substantiated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
only by a patient induction such as a brief
notice will not permit; but we pledge our
critical judgment to the assertion that there is
not a page in which statements do not occur,
which no judicial mind can accept. Thus, on
the very first page, <i>sub voce</i>, 'Laity,' Mr. Blunt
chooses to interpret the Hebrew word &#1506;&#1463;&#1501;, which
Gesenius and all lexicographers render 'people'&mdash;in
the sense of nations&mdash;by the ecclesiastical
word 'laity,' <i>i.e.</i>, the people as distinguished
from the priests. This enables him to give to
a number of instances in which the word
occurs just the twist of interpretation that his
theory demands. Surely a conscientious scholar
would refrain from giving a general term such
a special significance for the sake of sustaining
an ecclesiastical theory. It matters not that
the term is sometimes used in this sense, and
is applied to the people as distinguished from
the priests&mdash;Mr. Blunt treats it as the generic
sense. Under the word 'Latitudinarianism,'
among much prejudiced statement, we meet this
astounding assumption, 'this article (the 18th
of the Church of England) is somewhat loosely
worded; but by comparison of the language
used with the use of similar language in the
New Testament, it will be plainly seen to amount
to a statement that salvation is only to be
obtained within the boundaries of the Church.'
Under the word 'Lay-Co-operation' we have
this unscholarly, and must we not say spiteful,
assumption: 'Puritanism confounded the idea of
the <span class="greek" title="kl&ecirc;ros">&#954;&#955;&#8134;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span> and the <span class="greek" title="laos">&#955;&#945;&#8056;&#962;</span>, and if the phrase "co-operation
of the laity" had been known to it, the
theory of such co-operation, as well as the
practice, would have been resolved into a substitution
of the laity for the clergy, by setting
the former to do those works chiefly or solely
which especially belong to the office of the
latter.' Is it the function of a theological
dictionary to utter hypothetical prophecies
founded upon rash and gratuitous statements,
and conceived in a spirit of theological malice
like this? Under the head 'Lay Priesthood'
we read: 'This sacerdotal function of the
Christian laity is a consequence of the anointing
which they receive from God the Holy Ghost
in baptism and confirmation.... The Holy
Eucharist is offered at the altar by the priest
ordained for that purpose, and the lay priest
co-operates with him by saying "Amen" at
the giving of thanks.' Will Mr. Blunt permit
us to say that no lay scholar could possibly
have been guilty of such desperate assertions?</p>

<p>Passing over the word 'Limbo,' and some
regrets that it cannot be used on account of
prejudice, although perfectly unobjectionable
in itself, we find under the word 'Liturgy' the
usual assumptions of men of Mr. Blunt's school,
<i>e.g.</i>, 'the circumstances under which, the Holy
Eucharist was instituted, make it absolutely
certain that the Apostles celebrated it from the
first with a considerable amount of ritual preciseness,
and the same circumstances make it
probable that they also used from the beginning
some liturgical form. It seems to be unnecessary
to prove that the Apostles used some set
form of liturgy in celebrating the memorial of
their Lord.' And yet if Mr. Blunt would condescend
to furnish such proof, it would convert
to his views of things one-half of Protestant
Christendom.</p>

<p>Under the word 'Lollards,' Mr. Blunt is disingenuous
enough to cite against Wickliffe the
articles prepared for his indictment in the trial
before Archbishop Courtenay; among them,
'7. That God ought to obey the devil;' and
then to say, 'Such was the teaching initiated
by Wickliffe, and assiduously promulgated by
his followers.' It is surely a new thing to adduce
an indictment of enemies as a witness to
character. Does Mr. Blunt really believe that
this was Wickliffe's teaching? If he does, what
are we to think of his scholarship? If he does
not, what are we to think of his candour?</p>

<p>This brings us only to 'L&oacute;,' under the first
letter in this division of Mr. Blunt's work. We
need not say that these are fair samples of the
whole. We protest against such gross assumptions
and perversions in the name of simple
scholarship. We greatly regret that so much
labour and knowledge are thus perverted to
the aims of the fanatical polemic. His book is
not without its value, but it sorely tries the
patience of a simple inquirer after fact and
truth. Mr. Blunt has done his best to make
worthless a work that might have been a valuable
contribution to popular ecclesiastical
knowledge.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>The Evidences of Christianity in the Nineteenth
Century.</i> By <span class="smcap">Albert Barnes</span>. Blackie and
Son.</p>

<p>We have bracketed these two volumes together,
not simply because they are alike in
theme, but because by a peculiar coincidence
they are complementary of each other. Written
as we need scarcely say, altogether independently,
they yet arrive by opposite methods
at similar conclusions. From Scotland and from
America come the same earnest, forcible national
testimony to the truth of Christianity.
There are both likeness and unlikeness. Each
author treats his subject in a clear, attractive,
popular manner, candidly confessing difficulties
where such exist, yet carrying the reader
forward by the almost irresistible power of his
reasoning to the most decided conviction. The
literary style is eminently different, as is to be
expected when two diverse thinkers express
themselves on a common topic. This, however,
arises not only from the individuality of the
writers, but also from the very circumstances
in which their works were produced. Mr. Gilbert
Wardlaw has been 'secluded, during the
later years of life, from other opportunities of
service to the cause of truth,' and his book
therefore bears the impress of a thoughtful
mind evolving for itself arguments in support
of a faith in which has been found the truest
consolation during years of retirement. We
imagine that his very seclusion from active life
has compelled him to re-examine in the light of
modern scepticism the foundations of his belief.
His work is characterized by a calmness and
quiet force which we cannot too highly admire,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
and which must be productive of the happiest
results upon the minds of sincere doubters.
Mr. Barnes's volume, on the other hand, had a
different origin. It consists of a series of Lectures
in a Theological Seminary, which are
somewhat elaborate, diffuse, and theoretical,
and were evidently intended to produce an immediate
impression on an audience by their
style as well as their matter. Yet each work
is admirable. Both should be studied together,
since they look at the argument from diverse
stand-points. Their methods of treatment, not
only in manner but substance, are in harmony
with the circumstances in which these volumes
originated. The one may be described as the
subjective, the other the objective method. Mr.
Wardlaw, believing that the moral aspect of the
Christian revelation and the attitude of the inquirer
are the most important preliminary
questions in determining the truth of Christianity,
commences with the internal and experimental
evidences; while Mr. Barnes deals
with external proofs, looking at the Bible as a
book to be accounted for on historical grounds.
It has been a real mental gratification to study
these diverse methods, and to watch how,
though travelling by distinct lines of thought,
both authors arrive at the conviction that
Christianity is from God. The volumes are in
many ways helpful to each other, for if Mr.
Wardlaw's seems to suffer from condensation,
leaving too much to his readers' minds, the
same points are often elaborated by Mr. Barnes
with abundance of detail. It would have been
an improvement if, in 'The Leading Christian
Evidences,' italics or some other form had been
adopted by which the successive stages of the
argument would have been indicated, so that we
could at a glance gather up the main points
discussed. We do not venture on any criticism
of positions which we consider weak or unsound,
as our space is limited, and therefore content
ourselves with congratulating these authors on
their well-reasoned additions to our apologetic
literature.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>The Brahmo Somaj.</i> Lectures and Tracts. By
<span class="smcap">Keshub Chunder Sen</span>. First and Second
Series. Edited by <span class="smcap">Sophia Dobson Collett</span>.
Strahan and Co.</p>

<p>We have on previous occasions given considerable
space to the remarkable movement in
Hindu thought which is known to us under the
above title. Some of these lectures, notably
that on 'Jesus Christ&mdash;Europe and Asia,' have
long been before us, and offer a remarkable
sign of the effect produced on Indian society, by
the truth of Christ's life, and its sublime ideal
of conformity with the will of God enshrined in
the Gospels. The lack, the negation, the blank
in the theology of Mr. Sen need not be wondered
at. This is a very different phenomenon
from a similar mental position when adopted by
a professedly Christian teacher. These lectures
and tracts will receive special attention in consequence
of the recent visit to England of this
remarkable man, whose obvious earnestness
and passionate yearnings after the regeneration
of India have produced so deep an impression.
We do not in the least sympathize with the
hasty disposition shown by some to accept Mr.
Sen as a prophet of an undogmatic theism, nor
with his somewhat arrogant address to English
Christians from certainly very small acquaintance
with them and their work. All that he
knows of the higher life of faith and true holiness,
and all the stimulus that his own moral
nature and Hindu society have received of late
years, are so conspicuously due to the indirect
effects of missionary labour and Christian
teaching, that his disposition to ignore the
source of the new light that has flooded his
soul is unsatisfactory in the extreme. At the
same time, we do rejoice at the moral dignity
and spiritual ideal and religious exercise which
he is proclaiming to his countrymen. His protest
against Pantheism, his grasp of the idea of
'the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of
man,' of man's sin, and need of regeneration, of
man's dependence, and need of faith and resignation,
of self-sacrifice and prayer, are very instructive.
But let us clearly recognise the
position assumed by him, that Hinduism and
Mahometanism are themselves, in some purified
form, to 'harmonize and form the future
Church of India.' The words of Jesus or His
Apostles are often quoted by him with respect,
as something 'excellently and wisely said,' but
there is no acknowledgment of fealty to the
Lord, no Gospel but what he calls 'the Gospel
of Divine mercy,' based upon his own intuitions
and experiences.</p>

<p>'The true faith,' which is expounded in a series
of apothegms arranged under a variety of
headings, is intended to appeal to those who
are accustomed to the style of some of the best
of the sacred books. There is much that is
most excellent and Christian in its tone of feeling,
beautiful and attractive in form, lofty in
conception and ideal, as were the meditations
of Antoninus. He and his friends reveal the
potent influence, the pungent leaven, the grain
of mustard seed, that has been cast into the
Oriental mind. They are feeling after God and
finding Him. God has given them by His
Spirit some faith. May it daily grow to more
and more!</p>

<p>The literature of homiletics is becoming almost
redundant. It is singular that every man
whose business it is to teach this difficult
science is dissatisfied with the text-books and
manuals that his well-meaning predecessors
have prepared for him, and tries his hand at a
new one. We cannot see any very sufficient
reason for the work of Dr. Broadus. It is
neither better nor more comprehensive nor
more helpful than the well-known treatises of
Vinet, Kidder, and Shedd. It is not so philosophical
as M. Vinet's, nor so erudite as Dr.
Kidder's, nor so rich and suggestive as Dr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
Shedd's. It goes over the old ground in very
much the old way, and tells some of the old
stories, and gives much the same old advice.
Those who can work by rule, and who thoroughly
trust the rule-maker, will find the subject
carefully and exhaustively but not energetically
treated by Dr. Broadus. The contrast between
Dr. Broadus and Dr. Parker is great. The
'Advices to a Young Preacher' are racy, caustic,
and stimulating. They are not confined to
the great theme, but wisely condescend to give
useful hints on little things. The personal allusions
to living men, the astounding eulogiums
passed by Dr. Parker on some of his brethren,
the withering satire pronounced on others, the
conversational criticism on certain printed sermons,
and the familiar epistolary offer to all
and sundry to send the respected author a sermon
to criticise, almost take the breath out of
one's mouth, and certainly remove the volume
from the range of ordinary literature. The
specimen prayers introduced by the author,
though very excellent in their way, appear out
of place. Notwithstanding these drawbacks,
the book is full of strong and wise advice.
Here is caricature and broad farce, and extreme
exaggeration and violent personal attack under
assumed or blank names, all of which are
strangely out of tune with the manly and reverent
tone of the author when he touches the
deepest themes. A preacher of such high reputation
and undoubted success must be listened
to by young preachers with great interest.
Dr. MacLeod's volume has greatly delighted us.
Seldom have the high functions of Christian
truth, and the possibilities of the pulpit, been
more powerfully or more candidly put. We
wish that some of the unsuccessful men whom
Dr. Parker grinds to powder, would ponder
with the aid of this volume the sublime work
which may even now be within their reach.
Dr. MacLeod has described with singular power
and freshness 'the preacher as an <i>Elevator</i>,
as a <i>Healer</i>, as a <i>Reconciler</i>, as an <i>Educator</i>, as
a <i>Liberator</i>, and <i>Regenerator</i>.' Under these
several headings he has touched the sorest
places in our social life, has carried a torch into
some of the darkest chambers of human sorrow
and need, and has shown the mission of Christianity
and the function of its minister with
conspicuous success. Dr. MacLeod is wise and
stringent, moreover, in his condemnation of
those who only preach fragments of the truth
of God. His rebuke has a loving, helpful peal
in it, which makes the heart soft, and calls
aloud for higher effort and more consecrated
zeal. There is neither common-place exaggeration
nor rasping personality; it is full of wisdom,
strong sense, and earnestness.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>Culture and Religion in some of their Relations.</i>
By <span class="smcap">J. C. Shairp</span>, Principal of the
United Colleges of St. Salvator and St. Leonard,
St. Andrew's. Edinburgh; Edmonston
and Douglas.</p>

<p>The volume before us consists of five lectures
delivered by the principal of the United Colleges
of St. Leonard and St. Salvator, on a
theme of high interest, at a time when the elevating
process indicated by the rather vague
term 'culture' bids high to supersede the divine
claim and authoritative sway of religion.
Professor Shairp, though dealing with the relations
of culture and religion in a vein and manner
suited to popular address, reveals on every
page his own deep sympathy with the paramount
claims of religious truth and the spiritual
life of man, and a large-hearted appreciation of
those aspects of 'culture,' which its exclusive
advocates imagine never to have shed their
light on deeply religious minds. With great
dexterity, if, in the present case, such a term
is applicable, our author shows that starting
from a fair definition of 'culture,' 'it must embrace
religion and end in it;' and on the other
side, that Christianity is the great harmonizing
principle of human affairs, bringing one region
of human cultivation after another under its
sanctifying influence 'to reconcile all true human
learning not less than human hearts to
God.' In lecturing on the 'scientific theory of
culture,' our author exhibits the ideally educated
man on Professor Huxley's theory, and quotes
and criticises the celebrated comparison drawn
by him between the liberal education he demands,
and the acquaintance which an imaginary
chess-player should possess with the laws
of the mighty game with nature, on the success
of which his fortune and his life depend. Mr.
Shairp has shown with great beauty and force
of expression, that if there were no other than
the fixed laws of this game determined by
scientific investigation, 'men would be more
than ever driven inward, and their natural selfishness
be tenfold concentrated and intensified;'
that for the 'tender conscience' which
Mr. Huxley postulates as an element in wisely
playing this great game of life the 'theory'
makes no provision; and indeed that such conscience,
though the highest part of a man's nature,
would be no help, but a hindrance, to
any successful issue of the struggle. The
scientific theory of culture leaves out facts of
our nature which are as certain, though not so
apparent, as any fact which science registers.
With fine appreciation of all the excellencies of
Mr. Arnold's theory of culture, which he designates
as literary or &aelig;sthetic, Mr. Shairp contends
that Mr. Arnold has erred in his estimate
of what the spiritual energy really is in which
our highest good is to be sought, 'has made
that primary which is secondary and subordinate,
and made that secondary which by right
ought to be supreme.' He argues with much
force, that the first great commandment 'cannot
be made subservient to any ulterior purpose;'
that religion is either a good in itself or it is not
a good at all. We have not space to describe
the remaining lectures on 'Hindrances to Spiritual
Growth' and 'Combinations of Religion and
Culture.' The volume is charged with weighty
suggestions.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>The Witness of St. John to Christ; being the
Boyle Lecture for 1870; with an Appendix
on the Authorship and Integrity of St.
John's Gospel, and the Unity of Johannine
Writings.</i> By the Rev. <span class="smcap">Stanley Leathes</span>,
M.A. Rivingtons.</p>

<p>This is the third series of Boyle Lectures delivered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
by the Rev. Stanley Leathes. In the
first and second series, the author dealt with
the witness of the Old Testament, and that of
St. Paul to Christ. In the volume before us,
he pursues a similar method; and taking nothing
for granted, not even the genuineness of
the fourth Gospel, nor the inspiration of this,
or of other portions of the New Testament,
'he does not assume that its conception is true,
but he does affirm that if its message is fraught
with substantial truth, certain results will follow,
and&mdash;do follow.' In the appendix, there
is an effort made to grapple with the question
of the genuineness of the fourth Gospel, and
to meet the difficulties raised by Dr. Davidson,
the Rev. J. J. Tayler, and others. There is
nothing special or peculiar in this argument,
with the exception of the detailed effort which
Mr. Leathes has made to show the abundant
similarity of theme, doctrine, historical fact, and
even form of expression between the three
Synoptic Gospels and the Gospel of John.
We have never seen this point so well elaborated
elsewhere, and the obvious conclusion is
that much too great a stress has been laid upon
the supposed discrepancy of subject-matter
and ethical tone discernible between these documents.
We think that both Dr. Hengstenberg
and the Rev. John Godwin have handled
the Paschal difficulty more successfully than
Mr. Leathes, but few writers have shown with
more sufficiency and clearness the unity of the
Johannine writings. In fact, everything turns
in this discussion on satisfactorily showing the
possibility, from a literary standpoint, of the
identity of authorship of the Apocalypse and
the fourth Gospel. The T&uuml;bingen school, Dr.
Davidson, J. J. Tayler, and the most thorough-going
opponents of the genuineness of the
Gospel, admit, nay contend for the Johannine
authorship of the Apocalypse. They uphold
the external evidence for it against L&uuml;cke and
others; they establish the relations between
the John of the Synoptists and the Apocalyptist.
If, then, by accumulation of independent
evidence, the identity of the author of the fourth
Gospel with the Apocalyptist is established, or
a belief in it is shown to be perfectly rational,
a great victory is won for the faith of Christ.
We commend Mr. Leathes' argument to the
profound consideration of students. The eight
lectures deal with the credibility of the witnesses,
the characteristics of John's teaching,
the essentials of this teaching, John's appeal
to the inward witness, the unity of John's
writings, their authority, John's message to
the age, and John's place in Holy Scripture.
There is much fine and strong, though rather
cold and artificial reasoning in these lectures.
The reader feels a little too much as though he
were under the authoritative commands of a
drill-sergeant, or rather of a too officious guide,
who tells him exactly where he must stand, or
where he must not stand, in order to see some
glorious panoramic landscape. The hand of
the critic and the logician is always on the
shoulder, and forcing head and heart into the
appropriate and rational conclusion. Yet, with
this drawback, every lecture leaves a healthy
impression; and the testimony of the beloved
disciple to our Divine Lord seems at length to
be so strong and self-evidencing, that it matters
comparatively little when, where, or by whom
the testimony is given.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>Secular Annotations on Scripture Texts.</i> By
<span class="smcap">Francis Jacox</span>. Hodder and Stoughton.</p>

<p>This volume is the result of very extensive
and discursive reading. Sixty or seventy passages
of Scripture have been annotated by the
author from the copious stores of his secular erudition.
Choice fragments of poetry, philosophy,
and history, the analogies of life and thought,
with the high themes suggested by the sacred
text, are heaped in almost prodigal affluence of
illustration upon the foundation of each text.
Thus, on 'the Tempter's it is written,' our
author quotes in illustrative vein not only Bunyan,
and the criticism on the Dublin Synod of
Irish Catholics, but Shakespeare's 'Merchant
of Venice,' Gray, Coleridge, Burns, Diderot,
Thomas Carlyle, and Charles Dickens. In his
beautiful comment on 'Consider the lilies,' we
have Tennyson, and Justice Shallow, Leigh
Hunt and Mr. Proctor, Bishop Copleston, Isaac
Taylor, Shenstone, and Dr. Croly's Salathiel,
Mr. Hannay, and Mrs. Browning, all laid under
contribution, and a very charming mosaic is
the result. We might imagine the book to be
the work of a life-time, or the hobby of a
highly-cultured and devout man. Many a sermon
and many a platform-speech may hereafter
benefit by Mr. Jacox's labour of love; but
none will take the pure delight in it which
it must have given to the author in his quiet
hours. The annotations of the words 'Strangers
and Pilgrims,' 1 Peter ii. 11, are peculiarly
rich and beautiful.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>Rain upon the Mown Grass, and other Sermons,
1842&mdash;1870.</i> By <span class="smcap">Samuel Martin</span>,
Minister of Westminster Chapel. Hodder
and Stoughton.</p>

<p>The ministry of the Rev. Samuel Martin has
now for nearly thirty years exerted a spiritual
force upon an ever widening circle. Westminster
Chapel has constituted a focus of holy influence,
where his varied, thoughtful, continuous
instructions have not only gathered
around him one of the largest congregations in
England, but have conferred upon it a character
for wise effort, liberal sympathies, and
Christian devotedness. It would be impossible
to measure the circumference of that influence.
Few nonconforming churches in the kingdom
have failed at least to seek Mr. Martin's presence
and assistance when any great thing was
to be done; when any difficult enterprise needed
a special consecration, when a young pastor
at his ordination, or a church entering on a
new career of usefulness, craved sanctifying
counsel and tender sympathy. It would be
difficult to convey to a stranger, or to an unsympathizing
critic, any conception of the
strange fascination, the deep thrill of holy excitement,
the solemn hush of spirit which the
spoken words of Samuel Martin have produced
on susceptible minds. It is quite beyond our
power to analyze or account for the overwhelming
impression we have known him produce by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
his mode of quoting some well-known words
of Holy Scripture, or by iterating and reiterating
in a manner almost unique, the key-word or
clause of some discourse on which he has put
forth all his strength. His sermons are often
characterized by an exceeding quaintness which
from any other lips than his might provoke a
smile; by a subtle ingenuity of illustration
which reminds one of Brooks, or Sibbes, or
even of Thomas Adams; by an elaboration of
argument which seems to throw a disproportionate
weight on some minor truth of God's
word; by a fulness of illustration bordering
on the efflorescent; and by a tone of meditation,
fitted, as it might seem, to the cloister or
some learned leisure rather than to this busy,
world-harassed, distracted age: yet it is almost
impossible to listen to one of those exceptional
discourses without an intense desire for a
higher, more beautiful, more self-sacrificing
life. The exquisite sensitiveness of the
preacher to all the sorrows of men, his obvious
personal distress over the breaking heart
of suffering humanity, his quivering sympathy
with the weak and diseased, the poor, the out
cast, the prisoner, 'the publican and the sinner,'
the old man and the little child, make almost
every sermon a lesson in the 'enthusiasm
of humanity.' Much of every good sermon, is
beyond the power of reproduction by the press;
and this noble volume of Mr. Martin's discourses
has to some extent the effect upon the reader
which a volume of Beethoven's symphonies
might have upon a musical student who had
lost the power of hearing. Notwithstanding
this necessary peculiarity disparaging the
printed and revised report of all the noblest
productions of the pulpit, we render Mr. Martin
our unfeigned thanks for the volume. It
contains thirty-two discourses. Many of them
have been preached on special occasions, and
demand a little imagination from the reader
before he can understand their full significance.
Take, for instance, the sermon preached at the
opening of the new church at Halifax on the
text, 'Then the king said unto Nathan the
Prophet, See now, I dwell in a house of cedar,
but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.'
The three sacred places, 'the home,' 'the grave,'
'the sanctuary of God,' have never been more
admirably described, and the sketch given of
'the history of places of true worship' has
never been drawn with more graphic force or
spiritual beauty; but all the circumstances of
the day and the place of that discourse gave it
tenfold meaning. It would be well for those
who disparage the Puritan theology and its
professors, to understand that the high strain
with which the volume opens on the genial
influence and character of the Gospel, was
preached with electrifying power to one of the
great gatherings of Nonconformist ministers
and churches in the North of England.</p>

<p>The sermons on 'The Saving Name,' 'The
Precious Blood of Christ,' 'The Fulness of
God,' show how Mr. Martin handles some of
the great theological problems, and there is
hardly one which is not charged with deep
emotion, with carefully expressed thought, and
spiritual force. This last element is the distinctive
virtue of a volume which can scarcely
be touched without perceiving some electric
flash of light, some new pulsation of holy,
Christ-like feeling.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>The Shepherd of Hermas.</i> Translated into
English, with an Introduction and Notes.
By <span class="smcap">Charles H. Hoole</span>, M.A., Senior Student
of Christ Church, Oxford. Rivingtons.</p>

<p>It is not long since we called the attention of
our readers to the admirable translation, from
the Greek test, of the 'Shepherd of Hermas,'
which was published, together with other writings
of the so-called Apostolic Fathers in the
Ante-Nicene Christian Library. The Greek
text of this ancient Christian allegory or romance
was found, together with the epistle of
Barnabas, attached to the Codex Sinaiticus of
the New Testament; and this may account in
part for the revival of interest among the students
of ecclesiastical history in this once popular
but long-neglected fragment of antiquity.
Mr. Hoole has executed his task with great care
and painstaking, and has given in his 'introduction
and notes' some very valuable information
bearing on its interpretation, and on its reception
by the Ante-Nicene Fathers of the
Church. We are brought by it 'into the earliest
period of Christian antiquity.' It was
doubtless quoted by Iren&aelig;us, Clement of
Alexandria, Origen, and Eusebius, with a decreasing
respect; and we can only admire the
fine tact and good sense which ultimately led
the later writers and the Church Councils unequivocally
to exclude it from the Canon of the
New Testament. The question of the authorship
is enveloped in great obscurity, and the
apparently explicit statements are easily refutable.
It is not even certain, but indeed very
doubtful, whether the author was an ecclesiastical
officer of any kind. The supposed Ebionitic
tendencies of his doctrine have been maintained
strongly by Hilgenfeld, but refuted by
D&ouml;rner and Donaldson. We are surprised
that in virtue of the non-appearance in Latin
translations of the main passage on which this
charge rests, Mr. Hoole has thought fit to omit
it. Dr. Donaldson shows at length that there
is 'nothing in the teaching of Hermas with regard
to God, Christ, the Church, or the work
of salvation, which is contrary to the truths or
spirit of Christianity.' It is interesting also to
observe from various passages, that Hermas
identified the office of bishop and presbyter,
and makes no reference to the Eucharist.</p>

<p>These two volumes are extremely valuable;

beginning of the third, and can be almost conclusively
shown to be the work of one to whom
the interpolations of the Ignatian literature
were familiarly known, we obtain a valuable
additional test of the quality of second century
literature, and another assurance that the Gospel
of John must have preceded them by more
than a generation. It is not merely the abundant
quotation from the fourth Gospel, but the
profound difference of tone between these documents,
that is so remarkable. If this is the
second century theology and ecclesiasticism,
how comes it that an author living in that century
could rise such an untold height above
them and omit what unfortunately had become
the chief features of his time? Krabbe, in his
elaborate work on the Apostolical Constitutions,
concludes that the eighth book could not have
been written before the end of the fourth or
beginning of the fifth century. Bunsen thinks
that the law of interpolation may account for
the several references to later customs and
offices which are to be found there. At all
events, throughout the earlier books, we hear
nothing or next to nothing of the sacerdotal
order, and no other officer is mentioned intermediate
to bishop or deacon. In the eighth
book we have full-blown sacerdotalism and
episcopacy, and the several apostles are made
responsible for all the innovations. We owe a
great debt of obligation to the careful editors
of these translations now approaching their
term. The admirable indices of all kinds
greatly enhance the value of the work thus
accomplished.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>The Miracles of Our Lord.</i> By <span class="smcap">George Mac
Donald</span>. Straham and Co.</p>

<p>Mr. Mac Donald is well known in the circles
of the Church, for the ministry of which he
was educated, as a preacher of remarkable
freshness and power. Whatever judgment
may be passed upon some points of his theology,
there are few living men whose words are
fuller of high religious inspiration, and indicate
a more reverent and intense love for the Lord
Jesus. This is his distinctive claim as a religious
teacher. He disregards the conventionalities
of sermon-structure, and of sermon-speech,
and brings to bear upon his themes the
fresh thought of a man of genius, and the
penetrating spiritual insight of a man of fervent
piety. Whether any of these papers have
been preached as sermons we do not know;
thousands of readers have become acquainted
with them in the pages of the <i>Sunday Magazine</i>,
to which they were contributed. Mr. Mac
Donald has no difficulty in accepting the
miraculous; nay, he justly says that if the
Supreme Being 'be a God worthy of being God,
yea (his metaphysics even may show the
seeker), if He is a God capable of being God,
He will speak the clearest, grandest word of
guidance which He can utter intelligible to His
creatures.' 'The miracles are mightier far
than any goings on of nature, as beheld by
common eyes, dissociating them from a living
will; but the miracles are surely less than
those mighty goings on of nature with God,
beheld at their heart. In the name of Him
who delighted to say, "My Father is greater
than I," I will say that His miracles in bread
and in wine were far less grand and less beautiful
than the works of the Father they represented,
in making the corn to grow in the
valleys, and the grapes to drink the sunlight
on the hill-sides of the world, with all their
infinitudes of tender gradation and delicate
mystery of birth.' Whether we agree with
every minute interpretation or not, this little
volume, precious as fine gold, is full of penetrating
spiritual insight, of fine spiritual sympathy,
and of suggestions and inspirations greatly
helpful to the noblest spiritual life.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>Saint Paul: his Life, Labours, and Epistles.</i> A
Narrative and an Argument. By <span class="smcap">Felix
Bungener</span>. Translated from the French.
Religious Tract Society.</p>

<p>M. Bungener's is one of the numerous books
elicited by M. R&eacute;nan's assaults upon Christianity.
Such have always produced the effect
of multiplying defensive exposition and arguments.
They are therefore not to be regretted;
their resultant good is much greater than their
incidental evil. Untenable positions are tested
and abandoned, and valued defences are
strengthened. M. Bungener's argument is the
narrative. He goes steadily through the incidents
of the Apostle's history, parrying
attacks, and setting forth evidences and arguments
as he goes. His French brevity and his
religious earnestness give a great charm to the
volume.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>History and Revelation: the Correspondence
of the Predictions of the Apocalypse with the
marked Events of the Christian Era.</i> By
<span class="smcap">James H. Braund</span>. Two vols. Seeley,
Jackson, and Halliday.</p>

<p>In the exposition of the Apocalypse, literally
everything depends upon a right principle of
interpretation. Whether the symbolism of the
book has its solution in historic facts or in
spiritual principles, determines everything that
a writer has to say respecting it. Into these
two schools all interpreters of the Apocalypse
may be divided. Of the former, Mr. Elliott is
the modern Coryph&aelig;us, and he has found in
Mr. Braund a laborious disciple. 'The Hor&aelig;
Apocalyptic&aelig;,' he says, 'will be found, perhaps,
the nearest to perfection of its kind extant;'
and these two volumes are devoted to a patient
working out of historical coincidences and congruities.
Mr. Braund confidently trusts that
the proof from such congruity will be so self-evident
that it will be impossible to doubt. But
clearly it must depend very largely upon the historical
knowledge and imaginative ingenuity of
the interpreter, whether a fulfilment can be demonstrated
or not. For instance, there is much
more of ingenuity than of demonstration in
the fancy of Mr. Elliott adopted by Mr. Braund,
that the white horse of the first seal is the Roman
Empire, that the rider is Nerva, and that the
bow in his hand is the symbol of his Cretan
origin&mdash;the Cretans being great votaries of
Apollo. It may be so; but the mere statement
of it does not, in virtue of its congruity, carry
with it demonstrative proof. It is a mere piece
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
of <i>ipse dixitism</i>, which might find a hundred
parallels of equally ingenious suppositions.
On what authority, again, does Mr. Braund
affirm that the 'seven horns of the Lamb symbolize
his atoning work, because the blood of
the sin offering was sprinkled on the horns of the
altar, and the seven eyes, his mediatorial character
between God and men'? Horns are usually
the symbol of power, and eyes of wisdom. The
statement of Mr. Braund, so far from being
self-evidencing, provokes our incredulity.</p>

<p>For ourselves, we hold to the opposite principle
of interpretation, as substantially adopted
by Hengstenberg, Godwin, and others, viz.,
that the rise, progress, and overthrow of antichristian
principles&mdash;Jewish, pagan, infidel,
worldly and ecclesiastical&mdash;are symbolized in the
Apocalypse, and that with the development of
these, national events have to do in only a very
subordinate way. Then much of the symbolism
takes its place as mere parabolic drapery.
Whether any specific historical event find its
type in an Apocalyptic symbol or not, we cannot
err seriously if we lay hold upon a great principle;
certain it is that every antichristian power
in the history of the world has had its strength
in the domain of superstition, rather than in
mere historic incident; and to be assured of the
destruction of this is to be assured of the main
thing. We cannot help thinking that such
laborious demonstrations as Mr. Braund's are,
comparatively speaking, exercises of painful and
wasted ingenuity.</p>

They have all the fascinating characteristics of
his pen&mdash;graceful description, imaginative
reconstruction, unconventional, and often very
ingenious, sometimes learned, disquisition, with
the light, graceful touch of poetic style and
delicate fancy which ally all his productions

Words and Visions of the Apocalypse.</i>
By <span class="smcap">J. R. Macduff</span>, D.D. James Nisbet and
Co.</p>

<p>Dr. Macduff disavows all pretensions to be
a hierophant of the mysteries of the Apocalypse.
We are left to gather incidentally that
he himself inclines to what may be called the
spiritualistic, as distinguished from the historic
school of interpreters. His object in this
volume, however, is to present those 'manifold
isolated passages of transcendent grandeur,
beauty, and comfort ... which can be
see by the naked eye, without the aid of the
prophetic lens or telescope.' His selections
are made chiefly from the opening and closing
chapters. Dr. Macduff's manner of discoursing
is too well known to need characterizing;
it is enough to say that in these glorious
manifestations of the exalted Christ, he has,
with due regard to exegesis, indulged, wisely
and profitably, in the unction of description
and application which have made his books so
popular. No man may discourse of the new
heavens and the new earth without palpable
shortcoming, but he has given to devout
readers a wise and edifying book.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>Hours of Christian Devotion.</i> Translated
from the German of <span class="smcap">A. Tholuck</span>, D.D.,
Professor of Theology in the University of
Halle. By <span class="smcap">Robert Menzies</span>, D.D. Blackwood
and Sons.</p>

<p>This excellent manual of devotional thought,
the work of one of the greatest Biblical
scholars that Germany has produced, has passed
through many editions, and has been translated
into several different languages with more
or less of abridgment. Dr. Menzies has
accomplished the difficult task not only of
translating the prose meditations, but the numerous
poetical effusions that enrich and pervade
the volume. Seventy-six brief meditations
on personal, experimental, and practical
religion, are of course very varied in their
character. Thus one of them is a running
comment of extreme beauty on Psalm xxiii.,
followed by a poetical rendering of the spirit
of the Psalm, which, even in Dr. Menzies'
translation, is of a high order, as thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'I strayed a wild tumultuous road along,</p>
<p class="i1">My mind not less tumultuous than the way;'&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>And a few verses later on&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>'Rich is the banquet both for heart and eye,</p>
<p class="i1">As varying still their hues by night and day,</p>
<p>A world of flowers, like sparkling jewelry,</p>
<p class="i1">Their opening loveliness around display.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>'When shines the sun aloft without a cloud,</p>
<p class="i1">His smile evokes a pomp of colour bright;</p>
<p>Or if in gloom his radiant face he shroud,</p>
<p class="i1">Sweet violets shed their perfume thro' the night.'</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>We are tempted somewhat profanely to ask,
however, whether the perfume of the violet
quite carries out the idea of flowery beauty as
a banquet for the <i>eye</i> through the night? To
many of these meditations four or five great texts
are prefixed, and the reader feels that the gentle
pressure of a powerful hand has crushed
these sacred fruits, and handed him the fragrant
wine of the kingdom in a golden goblet. The
writer seems to blend his own spiritual history
with his exposition in such a way as to aid
the reader to make such experience his own.
Reading between the lines it is easy to perceive
the philosophic dissertant, the accomplished
Biblical scholar, the learned theologian,
but all is subdued to the language of simple,
earnest piety and profound devotion. Some
of the deepest mysteries of the kingdom of
God are made more comprehensible when thus
brought into the light and glory of the Most
Holy Place. We note particularly the meditations
on 'Drawing nigh to God,' and on 'By
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
grace made free from sin.' Thus, 'If peace
have departed from thy heart, build upon
the vacant spot a penitential altar, and peace
will again return, for the Lord Himself will
place upon it the atoning sacrifice. Can any
suppose that a servant who has transgressed
his Lord's will, and then with anxiety in his
heart sets about amending his ways, is as well
qualified to do good works as the child who
has wept repentant tears upon his Father's
bosom, and has had his faults forgiven? Oh,
no; the future cannot be made better until
the evil be made good.' The abundance and
variety of the material furnished in this volume
for quiet pondering render further characterization
difficult. We are thankful for the
introduction of this wise, thoughtful, helpful
book in this dark, sad season.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to amend the authorized
version without proceeding to a thorough revision
which again would necessitate a revision
of the <i>textus receptus</i> of the Greek. There
is no intelligible principle to guide an editor
in pursuing a middle course. Dr. Jacob has
improved the renderings in the <i>more important
instances</i> in which the labours of later critics
have shown that the translators to whom we
owe our justly venerated English version were
in fault. We are too thankful to have errors
removed in any degree to demur. The truth
is, that a false superstition for the authorized
version, like all false things, is permitted to
suppress true reverence for the Divine Word
as God gave it. It will soon cease to be a
question of the excellencies or defects of the
authorized version, and will become the imperative
duty of all who reverence that which
is the truest and most perfect record of revelation,
to protest against its usurpation of a
reverence due only to the original text. Another
bondage from which the editors of this
admirable edition are helping to deliver us is
that of chapters. The arrangement of the
text in paragraphs according to the sense, and
its division into sections corresponding thereto,
is a much greater service in interpretation
than many might suppose. This beautiful,
clearly printed, and carefully edited volume deserves
very high praise.</p>

It is not every teacher who can inculcate
religious truth with such penetrating wisdom

Mr. Abbott; but it is almost certain
that, practically, he must be an ingenious fanatic

Christmas pours from her cornucopia are her

man, moral and intellectual, as well as &aelig;sthetical,
we welcome still more heartily the affluent
Christmas supply of books which more
especially address themselves to the young.
Artistic excellence, romantic adventure, fairy
imagination, natural phenomena, the wonders
of travel and of science, creations of fiction
and fancies of poetry, are all brought under
requisition&mdash;and their very highest products
consecrated to the nurture of youthful imagination
and fancy, mind and heart. This is
one of our distinctive glories, and, we will venture
to say, a mark of distinctive wisdom,
that our literature for the young is so rich in
quality and so affluent in quantity. Few nations
possess a juvenile literature&mdash;France has
no children's books; neither has Spain, nor
Italy. Even our American cousins have a
very meagre native supply. Only Germany
can make any pretence to a comparison with
us. Month by month books for the young
are produced, and at Christmas-tide they are
poured forth in bewildering profusion; publishers
of gravest repute lay themselves out
for them; the staidest literary journals review
them. We have come to understand that no
service to a people can be greater or more
momentous than to supply a pure, bright,
merry-hearted literature for the young, which
shall wisely minister to their imaginations, and
in pleasant ways sow the seeds of good things
in their hearts. Happy are the children of
these days compared with those of the days of
'Goody Two Shoes' and 'Sandford and Merton.'
What a small British-Museum-library

have, from its birth, acquired and retained the
hundreds of juvenile publications of each year;
and what is more, how intelligent, if it had
imbibed all their instructions, how good if it
had embodied all their lessons. Tales of fairies
and genii abound, as is fitting and wise;
but it is no less a national blessing that our
juvenile literature is so wholesome. We can
speak only of a very few of the books which,
in every variety of form and character, seek to
brighten the nursery and the fire-side.</p>

<p>In the very foremost rank, whether in respect
of artistic attractiveness or of literary excellency,
we must place the dainty publications of
Messrs. Nelson. <i>In the Eastern Seas; or, The
Regions of the Bird of Paradise.</i> A Tale for
Boys. By <span class="smcap">W. H. G. Kingston</span>. <i>In the Wilds
of Africa.</i> A Tale for Boys. By <span class="smcap">W. H. G. Kingston</span>.
Two books of imaginative travel, in the
style that Mr. Kingston has made his own, full
of descriptive information carefully compiled,
and of adventurous incidents well imagined.
Mr. Kingston wraps the pill of useful information
in the jam of romantic adventure so deftly
that young patients will scarcely be conscious
of the physic&mdash;only of the gratification of their
intellectual palate. In the first of these works
Mr. Kingston carries his young friends to fresh
scenes and pastures new, and opens out to them
the tropical wonders of the Malay Archipelago.
Walter Heathfield, the hero of these adventures,
is a fatherless boy, who, with his sister, are
taken to the East by Captain Davenport. The
voyage is, of course, full of adventure and peril,
and all the phenomena of Eastern seas and skies
are observed. Singapore and Nagasaki open to
the young travellers the worlds of China and
Japan. Walter, with a companion, is washed
overboard in a typhoon, and, of course, is cast
upon a desolate island; after hair-breadth escapes
he returns to England, as the heir and
successor of his relative, Lord Heatherley; the
personal story being cleverly interwoven with
the useful knowledge. In the second book
named, Andrew Crawford is sent to sea, in
consequence of the mercantile reverses of his
father, with a due charge of good advice from
the latter. The captain dies, and the ignorant
mate permits the ship to be stranded on the
coast of Africa. A slaver picks up Andrew,
and part of the crew getting on shore, they resolve
to journey inland to the Crystal Mountains,
through the gorilla district, the wonders
of which are described. On the river, among
the mountains, through the wilderness, they
wander, until all the marvels of Central Africa
are described. These two books will be prime
favourites with boys. They are worthy of
Mayne Reid.&mdash;<i>The Sea and its Wonders.</i> By
<span class="smcap">Mary</span> and <span class="smcap">Elizabeth Kirby</span>. This is a companion
volume to 'The World at Home,' published
last year, of which it is in every way a
worthy successor. Both books are beautifully
got up as to paper, type, and binding, and are
most profusely illustrated with steel engravings.
The wonders of the sea itself, and of its productions,
are described in a clear and simple style,
and in short chapters, with paragraphs and
words equally short, so that the book has a most
inviting look to even an inexperienced reader.
It would be difficult to find a more interesting
as well as instructive book for children from
seven to fourteen, while to many beyond that
age, its facts will be new and interesting.&mdash;<i>The
Fall of Jerusalem and Roman Conquest of
Judea.</i> A condensed account of the 'Fall of
the Sacred City,' and a summary of the events
that led to it; followed by a vivid narrative of
the final subjugation of Judea. The last chapter
gives us the characters which Dean Milman
introduces in the 'Fall of Jerusalem,' and quotations
from it. It is an interesting and valuable
little book, well furnished with engravings.&mdash;<i>Lighthouses
and Lightships.</i> By <span class="smcap">W. H. Davenport
Adams</span>. A very complete and readable
account of the ancient Pharos and of our modern
lighthouses, with their principles of construction;
together with a correct list of those
that guard the dangerous coasts of Great Britain
and Ireland. A chapter is given to French
lighthouses, and to the manner of life of those
who spend their days in tending these safeguards
for our sailors. As a book of reference
it will be very useful, but it will repay a careful
reading before being consigned to the reference
shelf. The illustrations, over sixty in
number, give life and interest to the little
volume, which is intended for no especial class
of readers, but for both young and old who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
care for the welfare of humanity.&mdash;<i>Cyril
Ashley.</i> A Tale. By A.L.O.E. Another of
A.L.O.E.'s instructive stories for young people,
which the authoress, in a touching preface,
'thinks will be the last time she may be permitted
to bring her pitcher from the well-spring
in which she has so often dipped it.' Cyril
Ashley is a young man of singular prudence
and goodness, who has thrust upon him by
stern duty the reformation of a weak, selfish
step-father, and a number of unruly half-brothers
and sisters. The history of Jonah is
the stimulus and deeply pondered lesson which
gives him the resolution to carry that trying
task to a satisfactory issue.&mdash;<i>Birds and
Flowers.</i> By <span class="smcap">Mary Howitt</span>. A volume of
verses on birds and flowers, enlarging the latter
term, that is, so as to include orchard and
forest trees; written on that high level of excellence
which makes Mrs. Howitt's poetry so
pleasant and readable, although there are not
many pieces of it that abide in the memory, or
will take their place in our permanent poetical
literature. The illustrations by M. Giacomelli,
the French artist who illustrated 'the Bird' of
M. Michelet, are very beautiful. They are all
vignettes, or initial letters, or chapter headings,
but they are done with great artistic skill and
delicacy. Altogether this is one of the most beautiful
of smaller Christmas books. Graceful song
and artistic picture together will charm young
readers, and supply a very choice gift-book for
them.&mdash;<i>The Spanish Brothers.</i> A Tale of the
Sixteenth Century. By the Author of 'The
Dark Year of Dundee,' &amp;c. The author of the
series, of which this is one volume, has much
of the careful skill and fascination of the author
of the Sch&ouml;nberg-Cotta series. Many suspected
her first work to be from the pen of the latter.
The 'Spanish Brothers' contains a vivid picture
of the horrors of the Inquisition, and of
the heroism with which many of the early
Protestants in Spain endured its inflictions&mdash;life-long
incarcerations, and <i>auto-d&aacute;-f&eacute;'s</i>, at
which men, and even women of gentle birth
were burned to death before crowds of exulting
spectators. Such things are strange to read of
in these our 'soft times,' but there is abundant
evidence to prove that both the cruelty and the
heroism in their extremest forms were real
facts. The fictitious part of the book is a story
(interesting, but rather too long) of two brothers
devoted to each other, and to the idea of a father
whom they had never seen, until one of them
comes accidentally to share his prison. The two
then remain together till the death of the father
and the martyrdom of the son.&mdash;<i>The
Story of our Doll.</i> By Mrs. <span class="smcap">George Cupples</span>. The
adventures of little Maggie's foundling doll will
appeal very successfully to the make-believe
imagination of little children, and greatly delight
them.&mdash;<i>Wonders of the Plant World;
or, Curiosities of Vegetable Life.</i>&mdash;<i>Useful
Plants. Plants adapted for the Food of Man,
Described and Illustrated.</i>&mdash;<i>Walter in the
Woods; or, Trees and Common Objects of the
Forest Described and Illustrated.</i> Three little
books designed to give young people popular
botanical knowledge. The first is the more
scientific in form. The last two have recourse
to that kind of conversational incident and
illustration which children will listen to for
hours. All three may be commended.&mdash;<i>Pictures
and Stories of Natural History.</i> A
series of short sketches of different animals,
with very effective coloured plates of each animal
described. Admirable for juveniles.</p>

<p>Foremost and best among Messrs. Hodder &amp;
Stoughton's juvenile books comes <i>Old Merry's
Annual</i>, the prince of its class, as Aunt Judy's
volume is the princess. Brilliant in crimson
and gold, and chubby in form like a winter
apple, Old Merry comes forth to brighten
Christmas firesides, as cheery, wise, wholesome,
and quaint as ever. Among the annuals
we like it the best. Stories, gossipy chats <i>de
omnibus</i>, puzzles, useful information about
most things that interest boys, and didactic
papers, make up a miscellany which it is impossible
to describe, and difficult to overpraise.
M. D. Liefde's story is the <i>vale</i> of an able man,
a great favourite with young people. It is
chiefly a posthumous publication.&mdash;<i>Madeleine's
Trial, and other Stories.</i> From the French of
<span class="smcap">Madame de Pressens&eacute;</span>. A group of simple
stories illustrative of the law of love. The
translator has made them so English in tone as
well as in style that the flavour of the original
is well-nigh exhaled.&mdash;<i>Walter's Escape; or,
The Capture of Breda.</i> By <span class="smcap">J. B. De Liefde</span>.
A spirited account of one of the most remarkable
exploits in the heroic struggles of the
Dutch to secure their liberty. It is written
with the author's wonted vigour.&mdash;<i>Model Women.</i>
By <span class="smcap">William Anderson</span>. This volume
gives us slight sketches of the Mother of the
Wesleys, Elizabeth Fry, Amelia Sieveking,
Felicia Hemans, Hannah More, Elizabeth Browning,
Caroline Herschel, Selina Countess of Huntingdon,
and a few others whom the author conceives
to have been respectively 'model women,'
either in domestic life, philanthropic effort, literary
achievement, scientific research, or Christian
consecration. There is not much power
or point in the characterization of these distinguished
women, but the brief memorials of
some of them are interesting, and may help to
raise the idea of women's work.</p>

<p>Messrs. Griffith and Farran sustain the reputation
of the house that became famous by the
publication of 'Goody Two Shoes.' They have
an admirable staff of writers for young people,
and the works they produce are of a highly interesting
and instructive character. One of
the best this year is <i>Household Stories from
the Land of Hofer; or, Popular Myths of
Tirol.</i> By the Author of 'Patra&ntilde;as; or, Spanish
Stories.' Between twenty and thirty stories
of myth and magic of the old-fashioned
sort, embodying the wild legends that hang
about the valleys of the Tyrol (the writer pedantically
spells it Tirol), and have haunted
them for a thousand years. The Norgs, or
little men, are the chief heroes, a kind of
southern Trolls, or dwarfs of the Black Forest.
It is a class of myths less known than those of
Scandinavia, but having many of their weird
characteristics. The most popular are 'Nickel
of the Mine,' the little man of the mountain
who dug riches for the covetous, selfish Aennerl;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
and the 'Rose Garden of King Sweyn,'
made by the Norg king for his mortal bride,
whom, however, after a fierce combat, he had
to surrender to Theodoric the Visigoth. Many
of the stories are legendary embodiments of
the struggle between Christianity and Paganism.
Since Dr. Dasent's 'Norse Tales,' a
more important and interesting collection of
legends has not appeared.&mdash;<i>Tales of the Saracens.</i>
By <span class="smcap">Barbara Hutton</span>. These tales are
history, not fiction, treating first of Mohammed
as prophet and as conqueror, and then of the
line of Caliphs by whom he was followed.
The book is written in a clear and lively style,
and to intelligent readers will prove both entertaining
and instructive.&mdash;<i>Sunny Days; or,
A Month at the Great Stowe.</i> The Great
Stowe is a farmhouse in the country, at which
a family of little town-folk spent a month.
We are told all that they saw and did, and a
right merry party they were; none the less so
for the wise discipline and sententious wisdom
and clever stories of Aunt Gommie. 'Aunt
Gommie is like a spider; she goes on spin,
spin, spin, and she is never at a loss for a
web.'</p>

<p>Sampson Low &amp; Co. have re-published a
charming American Story, <i>Little Women; or,
Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy</i>. By <span class="smcap">Louisa M. Alcott</span>.
Whether Miss Alcott is the most popular
of American writers for young people we
do not know; but beyond all question, 'Little
Women' is just now the most popular American
juvenile fiction. You see it upon every
American book-stall, and find it in almost
every American home. It is having a greater
run than any recent fiction; and it is really a
very charming story. The 'Little Women'
are the four children of Mr. March, an American
pastor, away South at the war. Their characters
are delineated, and their history, from early
girlhood to motherhood, traced with a consummate
cleverness. Miss Alcott has not, perhaps,
so delicate a touch as the author of the
'Gayworthy's,' nor so graphic a power as
Mrs. Beecher Stowe; but she has delicacy, descriptive
power, and force of no ordinary kind.
One of the most promising characteristics of
American fiction is its individuality. There is
a marked family likeness among the fictions by
female writers, which during the last few years
have obtained such popularity among ourselves.
They are redolent of American character and
life, especially of New England life, and have
also an intellectual cast of their own&mdash;a kind
of household idealism, quaintness, and piety,
not easy to describe, but unmistakably to be
recognised. We predict for 'Little Women'
a popularity greater than that of the 'Wide,
Wide World,' 'The Gayworthy's,' or 'Faith
Gartney's Childhood.' We are not sure that
our American cousins do not, in this department
of literature, far excel any writer that we
can boast There are two or three other books
of Miss Alcott's ('The Old-Fashioned Girl,' for
instance) with which we should like English
children to be acquainted, although they are
not quite equal to 'Little Women.'</p>

<p>Messrs. Bell and Daldy send <i>The Brownies,
and other Tales</i>. By <span class="smcap">Juliana Horatio Ewing</span>.
Beautiful stories, charmingly told, with capital
illustrations by our old friend George Cruikshank.&mdash;<i>Aunt
Judy's Christmas Volume for
Young People</i> contains a wealth of instruction
and amusement, which we have neither time
nor space to describe. Our young readers
should get it, and judge for themselves, and
we assure them they will not be disappointed.&mdash;<i>Waifs
and Strays of Natural History.</i> By
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Alfred Gatty</span>. An elementary book of
instruction, concerning corals and coral islands,
the Beaver, sponges, zoophytes, microscopic
objects, &amp;c., conveyed in Mrs. Gatty's charming
way. Nothing lends itself more easily to
romance than natural phenomena, and Mrs.
Gatty's readers need not to be told how magical
Aunt Judy's pen is.&mdash;<i>Parables from Nature.</i>
Fifth Series. By Mrs. <span class="smcap">Alfred Gatty</span>.
Eight more of Mrs. Gatty's popular parables,
about 'Consequences,' 'Ghosts,' 'Unopened
Parcels,' 'See-Saw,' &amp;c. The one on 'Unopened
Parcels' is the longest and the best.&mdash;<i>Deborah's
Drawer.</i> By <span class="smcap">Eleanor Grace O'Reilly</span>.
The author of 'Daisy's Companions' cannot fail
of an eager welcome from the readers of that
charming little volume. Here is a companion
to it. Deborah is the dead sister of Lavinia
Meek, who had a great gift of telling and writing
stories for children. These had been put
away in a drawer, which Lavinia Meek opens
for the amusement of little Averil, who reads
four or five clever and touching little stories
which she found there. These are set in a neat
framework of personal history. The little book
is a gem.</p>

<p>Messrs. Seeley and Co. send us <i>Aunt Judith's
Recollections; a Tale of the Eighteenth Century</i>.
By the author of 'Missionary Recollections.'
Aunt Judith flourished in the days of Wesley
and Whitfield, and in a pleasant chatty way,
though somewhat garrulous withal, the old
lady tells her young niece Annie the story of
those times&mdash;of the darkness which had settled
on this England of ours, and of the great
awakening that followed the labours of those
holy, earnest men.&mdash;<i>Hetty's Resolve; a Story
of School Life.</i> By the Author of 'Under the
Lime Trees.' There is but little power or point
in these rather prosy details of school routine;
but if they should lead some young readers to
shun the slippery ways of Florence Benson,
and to imitate the honest work of the kind-hearted
Maggie, they will not have been written
in vain.&mdash;<i>Curious Facts about Animals.</i> For
Little People. <i>Evening Amusement.</i> Two
little books for little folk, simply written and
attractively illustrated; the former describing
the habits of the mole, the badger, the otter,
the deer, the dog, the sheep, the horse, &amp;c.,
and telling anecdotes respecting them; the latter
a series of juvenile stories of the simplest
kind, which derive their main interest from the
children cutting out figures in black paper to
illustrate them.&mdash;<i>Tony and Puss.</i> From the
French of <span class="smcap">P. J. Stahl</span>. With Twenty-four Illustrations
from designs by Lorenz Fr&ouml;lich.
Another dainty book for very little children,
with multitudinous groupings of Tony and
Puss in varied relationship. Some of the illustrations
are very clever, though Herr Fr&ouml;lich's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
typical 'Papa' looks rather of the feeble
order; but he may not be less welcome to the
Tinies, for whose special advantage Messrs.
Seeley and Co. cater so lavishly.&mdash;<i>Sunday
Echoes in Weekday Homes.</i> By Mrs. <span class="smcap">Carey
Brock</span>. This book is a history of the home
life of some young people, who having been
trained to look upon the Bible as connected
with every thought and incident of their lives,
find in the journeyings of the children of Israel
types and emblems of their own doings
and trials, at home and at school. It is none
the less interesting to the class for whom it is
written, if less true to Nature, that the children
themselves suggest the warnings given and the
lessons taught by God's dealings with the Israelites.
From the 'passing over Jordan' of
the youngest of the family the rest derive
much comfort in seeing one of their number
enter the 'promised land.'</p>

<p>Messrs. Cassell cater liberally and successfully
for young readers. <i>The Log of the Fortuna:
a Cruise on Chinese Waters.</i> Containing
Tales of Adventure in Foreign Climes, by
Sea and by Shore. By Captain <span class="smcap">Augustus F.
Lindley</span>. A Collection of 'Seven Sailors'
Yarns'&mdash;not all of them, however, relating to
China. The scene of one of them is laid in
Paris; of another, among Australian Bushrangers;
of another, in the Sea of Azof. The
'Yarns' are told on board the <i>Fortuna</i>, which
has got upon a mud-bank in Chinese waters,
and waits for spring tides. Captain Lindley
wields a vigorous, incisive, and humorous pen.
His stories are therefore clever and amusing:
some of his descriptions and bits of rollicking
humour would not discredit Charles Lever.
The book is profusely illustrated, and, like all
the publications of this firm, marvellously
cheap.&mdash;<i>Home Chat with our Youngsters.</i> By
<span class="smcap">C. L. Mateaux</span>. Never was instruction more
acceptably given or more sweetly sugared than
in this attractive volume. The twenty-two
chapters on 'People, and things which the
Young Folks see or hear about,' are illustrated
on almost every page. The chapters are conversational
in form, the young folks asking
only sufficient questions to mask the monotony
of unbroken information. The story of 'Columbus'
is thus told, and is made lucid by illustrations.
Simpler synonyms for some of the
words might have been found, but the book
will be a great favourite in the nursery. It is,
for children a stage farther advanced, almost
as good as 'The Children's Album.' We can
give it no higher praise.</p>

<p>From the Religious Tract Society we have received&mdash;<i>Spanish
Pictures Drawn with Pen and
Pencil.</i> By the Author of 'Swiss Pictures
Drawn with Pen and Pencil.' We have done&mdash;what
doubtless some of our readers have
done&mdash;tested the 'Swiss Pictures' by taking it
to Switzerland as a <i>quasi</i> guide-book. We
found it carefully accurate, and full of intelligent
observations. This bespeaks our confidence
for this companion volume about Spain.
'Africa begins at the Pyrenees,' says the
French proverb: so does our author: and even
veteran travellers will feel that once over the
Pyrenees they are in a <i>terra incognita</i>. And
yet few lands are physically more unique, romantically
more full of wild legends, historically
more full of romance, ethnologically more interesting,
and socially and religiously more full
of undeveloped possibilities. Madrid, the
Escurial, Granada, Seville, &amp;c., are visited and
described. Cathedrals, bull-fights, gipsies,
Murillo, religious customs, literature, trade, the
Moors, all receive due notice; and have thrown
upon them gleams of history, snatches of
poetry, and visions of the future. The author
has freely laid under contribution writers of
renown, large extracts from whom are interwoven
with his narrative of personal experience.
Gustave Dor&eacute; is among the eminent artists
who have supplied the illustrations. It is an
instructive and effective popular book.&mdash;<i>The
Picture Gallery of the Nations</i> is a series of
short descriptive chapters of about seventy of
the nations of the earth; each occupying only
a page or two, and illustrated with very effective
wood-cuts, some of them whole-page size,
others smaller. It is a popular book of the
best kind for young people who delight in the
help which the eye affords to the instruction of
the pen.&mdash;<i>Original Fables.</i> By Mrs. <span class="smcap">Prosser</span>.
Readers of 'The Leisure Hour' and 'The
Sunday at Home' are familiar with Mrs. Prosser's
name as the writer of two or three capital
serial stories which appeared in these publications.
With these fables they will, through the
same medium, have made acquaintance. To
write fables successfully has been given to only
three or four of the human race&mdash;the author of
those which pass under the name of &AElig;sop, La
Fontaine, and Kriloff are the only three names
of great fable-writers that occur to us. Mrs.
Gatty very successfully attempts parabolic
stories, but not the terseness and brevity of
the fable proper, which is to fiction what the
sonnet is to poetry&mdash;what the proverb is to the
sermon. Mrs. Prosser has done fairly where
so few have done well. From the nature of
the case we cannot quote (to analyze would
carry us beyond our space); we content ourselves
therefore with a general commendation.
The morals which she weaves into fables may
catch the fancy of children, whom an apothegm
would only make callous.&mdash;The <i>Leisure Hour</i>
and the <i>Sunday at Home</i> are sustained at a degree
of almost unrivalled adaptation and efficiency.
Tale, biography, sermon, and song,
often of a very high order, diversify and enrich
their pages. We are glad to see in the
'Leisure Hour' the wise breadth and impartiality
which supplies biographers of characters so
diversified as those of Miss Burdett Coutts,
Charles Dickens, P&egrave;re Hyacinthe, Professor
Huxley, Mr. Disraeli, and General Trochu.
Mr. Lord, Naturalist to the Egyptian Exploring
Expedition, supplies a valuable series of papers
on the 'Peninsula of Sinai.'&mdash;<i>Cousin Mabel's
Experiences.</i> By <span class="smcap">E. Jane Whately</span>. Cousin
Mabel having been absent from England for
some years, in visiting various home circles is
much struck by the diversified errors and follies
into which religious people have fallen, whose
earnestness and seriousness cannot be doubted.
The ritualism of young ladies run wild upon
church decorations, the spiritual gossip in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
which certain elderly people indulge, the doing
for the poor and strangers to the neglect of
home duties, the party spirit pervading missionary
work, with other forms of worldliness
and selfishness, which are so largely mixed up
with many forms of religious life&mdash;all these
grave errors are exemplified in a series of unconnected
stories of family life. Miss Whately
does not exaggerate in her characters the
follies she wishes to point out; and her way of
combating them is one of much wisdom, and is
combined with many practical hints, calculated
to effect in actual life the reforms which in
these tales is always achieved. We trust the
practical result may be the same.&mdash;<i>The First
Heroes of the Cross.</i> By <span class="smcap">Benjamin Clarke</span>.
Sunday School Union. Mr. Clarke's 'Life
of Jesus, for Young People,' has been received
with so much favour that he has
attempted to tell the story of the Acts of
the Apostles in the same way. He has done
this admirably, with great simplicity, and in a
very interesting way. Mr. Clarke has spared
no pains to qualify himself for forming and expressing
true conceptions of the incidents that
he narrates.

APRIL 1871</h2>

<hr class="l30" />

<p class="hang p2"><span class="smcap">Art. I.</span>&mdash;<i>Burton's History of Scotland.</i>
Vols. V., VI., and VII. London. 1870.</p>

<p>The affairs of Scotland will always occupy
an honourable and conspicuous place in the
grand drama of national development which
makes up the history of the British Empire.
It has been the destiny of the Scottish people
to influence the general fortunes of England
in a larger degree, and more permanently,
than could have been expected from
their mere numbers, or their position in the
north of our island. In the years which
succeeded the Norman Conquest, Scotland
was, in some measure, a place of refuge for
the English name from foreign oppression;
and though deeply penetrated by the Norman
elements which consolidated and
strengthened her feudal monarchy, she
held up something like a beacon of hope
before the eyes of the down-trodden Saxon,
during the calamitous period of alien domination.
Two centuries later, when her nationality
had become more firmly established,
when her Highland clans, her Anglo-Norman
colonies, her Norse settlements, and
her Lowland commonalty had been brought
nominally under a supreme government,
though not yet formed into one people, she
exhibited to the world a magnificent spectacle
of prolonged, stubborn, and successful
resistance to the encroachments of a very
superior power; and, in the internecine
struggle which ensued, we see distinctly the
high qualities which have made her the
worthy compeer of England. It was probably
one of the results of this contest that
France, aided by her Northern ally, was
enabled to throw off the Plantagenet yoke,
and to acquire the position she still holds in
Europe; and, but for Verneuil and other
battles, it is possible that, in the fifteenth
century, England might have become a military
despotism, extending from the Western
Isles to the Pyrenees, and have had a completely
different history. It is unnecessary
to say what Scotland accomplished at the
great crisis of the Reformation; if, in the
person of Mary Stuart, her dynasty threatened
England with subjection and with the
despotism of the Catholic League, her people
proved the defence of Protestantism, rejected
the sovereign they justly detested,
gave strength to the counsels of Elizabeth,
and contributed largely to the success of the
policy which culminated in the ruin of the
Armada. For it was at the momentous
period of the civil wars of the seventeenth
century that the house of Stuart and part of
the Scottish nobility endeavoured to blight
the prospects of England, to stifle freedom
by military power, and to restore what was
Romanism all but in name; but the mass of
the nation opposed the movement, and set
the noble example of resistance to it; and
though they ultimately separated from England,
they did much to cause the series of
events which ended in the Revolution of
1688. Scotland, in a word, has had a beneficent
influence of a marked and even extraordinary
kind in shaping the course of our
English story; and we need not notice how
her independent spirit has affected for good
the national character, what eminent men
she has given the State, what valuable additions
she has made to the treasures of British
literature and thought, what use some of her
institutions have been, as patterns for our
own imitation.</p>

<p>The author of the interesting volumes before
us has long held a distinguished name
in connection with the literature of his country.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
He has given us an exceedingly good
account of the transitional period in the history
of Scotland, which embraces the Revolution
of 1688, the Union, and the final extinction
of the reactionary and half-Romanist
party in the nation, when Jacobitism
perished in 1745. He has also described
with clear insight, and, on the whole, with an
impartial pen, that honourable episode in
Scottish annals, of lasting importance to
these kingdoms, the 'ancient league' of
Scotland with France; and no writer, perhaps,
has done more to elucidate whatever is
most noteworthy in the antiquarian remains
and monuments of the races which from the
earliest times have inhabited the northern
division of our island. The history, however,
which he has just completed, and which
deals with the affairs of Scotland from the
Roman invasion, under Agricola, to the
overthrow of the House of Stuart, is, beyond
comparison, his greatest work; and as a repository
of the learning with which modern
research and criticism have explored the national
life of his countrymen, it stands alone,
and without a parallel. Mr. Burton, in his
first four volumes, which were published in
1867, carried down his narrative from the
legendary period of the Roman occupation,
of the Scots and Picts, of Fergus and the old
Celtic monarchy, to the rise of the feudal
kingdom of Scotland and its long contest
with the power of England; and he went on
to describe the memorable era when the ascendancy
of France, and national pride resenting
Flodden and Pinkie Cleugh, struggled
with the forces of the Scottish Reformation;
and Mary Stuart, but for her crimes
and her fall, would probably have united the
two crowns, and become the sovereign of a
Romanized Britain. If in treating this important
part of his subject Mr. Burton was
sometimes carried away by a somewhat too
exuberant patriotism, if he, perhaps, assigned
too high a place to the position of Scotland
in British annals, and if he was never
eloquent or picturesque, he displayed rare
and extensive knowledge, a judgment usually
calm and correct, and the faculty of forming
sound conclusions; and his account of the
Scottish war of independence, and of Scottish
politics in the sixteenth century, is
worthy of very high commendation. His
last three volumes, which have recently appeared,
and which we purpose now to review,
comprise the last years of the reign of
Mary Stuart, the triumph of the Reformation
in Scotland, the struggle between the Kirk
and the Crown, which marked the beginning
of the seventeenth century, the reaction
against James I. and his son, and the memorable
events which were the result; they proceed
to describe the great civil war, the important
attitude of Scotland in it, the conquest
of the kingdom by Cromwell, and the
dreary epoch which followed the Restoration;
and, as may be supposed, they exhibit
the merits and the shortcomings of the earlier
volumes. Mr. Burton is inclined to exaggerate
the part which Scotland played in
1640-1649: he is rather too lenient to the
Stuart kings, and he is not skilful in the art
of composition. But, on the other hand,
his learning is profound; his views of most
of the great questions which arose during
this memorable epoch, are sound and judicious,
and deserve attention; and, on the
whole, he has placed the events of the drama
of which he has followed the chequered
scenes, in their true light and real significance.</p>

<p>Mr. Burton's narrative begins at the period
of the imprisonment of Mary Stuart at Lochleven.
A few months previously the Scottish
queen had been the hope of the Catholic
Powers, which were ever planning the ruin
of Elizabeth, and the overthrow of the Reformation
in England; and, widely as they
were divided from each other, they looked
upon her as the appointed instrument with
which to assail the common enemy. Her
beauty too, her extraordinary gifts, the magic
of her presence, and her rare abilities, had
won the hearts of the Scottish nobility; and
though she had never deceived Knox and
the earnest champions of Scottish Protestantism,
the pride of the nation was aroused in
her favour, from the circumstance that it
seemed probable that the two crowns would
unite on her brow, and that she would become
the sovereign of England and Scotland.
Distrusted as she was in England by
all the real friends of the Reformation, she
was supported by the Catholic party, still
most formidable in rank and numbers; and
she had on her side the conservative feeling,
of extraordinary strength in that age, which
saw in her the heir to the throne, Elizabeth
being without children, and the means of
bringing England once more into the old
order and ways of Europe. Had Mary
Stuart not disgraced herself in the opinion
even of that generation, not over-scrupulous
about the acts of princes, there can be little
doubt that she would have been acknowledged
as Elizabeth's successor; and very
probably she would have brought the reign
of the heretic Tudor to a close, would have
become the ruler of England and Scotland,
arrested the Reformation for a time, and
changed the whole tenor of our history.
Providentially, however, this was not to be;
and Mary Stuart, by her own hand, was to
destroy the prospect of power and ambition,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
fraught with destruction to the destinies of
mankind, which fortune seemed to have
opened to her. The murder of Darnley,
followed by the shameless and infamous
marriage with Bothwell, revealed the depths
of recklessness and crime in the existence of
this singular woman, and placed her at once
under the moral ban of Scotland, England,
and Catholic Europe. At Carberry Hill her
followers' arms dropped, as it were, from
their nerveless hands; the nation rose in fury
against her; her adherents were for the time
silenced; and she found herself on a sudden
a prisoner, her son proclaimed, the Reformation
victorious, and Murray exercising the
powers of a regent; the whole scene changing
as if by magic. Catherine de Medicis,
also, gave her up, alarmed at the storm
which had burst out in Scotland; and though
undoubtedly the Florentine queen was not
guided by moral considerations, and, at this
moment was beginning to adopt a conciliatory
policy towards the French Huguenots,
her complete abandonment of Mary Stuart
was caused chiefly by a true conviction that
she had ruined herself in general opinion.
Philip II. also declined to give the slightest
countenance to the beautiful fury, in whom
he had hoped to find a St. Teresa; and in
Catholic and Conservative England the revulsion
of feeling was so strong, that thenceforward
the cause of Mary Stuart ceased to
be national in any real sense.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott and Mr. Froude have
given us very different accounts of the captivity
of Mary Stuart at Lochleven. Mr.
Burton has taken great pains to ascertain
the facts, and to judge of them, and we
quote a few words from his description:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'The conclusion of all is, that there is
nothing in the conditions to justify the inference
that the captive was to be sent thither as
to a place of sordidness and severity, as well as
of seclusion and security.... There
is no evidence that the Lady of Lochleven
treated her prisoner harshly. Much vigilance
was necessary, however, and that could not
be accomplished without giving annoyance
and even pain. The daughters of the house
shared the prisoner's bed. To one who had
enjoyed full command over the stately reserve
of the court of France, and the impregnable
barrier of isolation which it had put at her
disposal, this may have been a heavy grievance;
it can be paralleled only by the sufferings
of people accustomed to civilized refinement,
when their lot is cast among barbarians.'&mdash;(Vol.
v. 98.)
</p>
</div>

<p>The only personage, as is well known, who
seems to have shown any real sympathy
with the Queen of Scotland, in this forlorn
condition, was the sovereign who, it might
be supposed, was of all persons the least
likely to do anything in behalf of her cause.
On hearing of the imprisonment of Mary,
Elizabeth not only refused to give open support
to her 'rebellious lords,' but actually
threatened to invade Scotland, should they
not restore their mistress to the throne, on
terms, however, dictated by England. To
suppose that this conduct is to be ascribed
to chivalrous generosity would be a mistake;
nor do we think with Mr. Burton, that it was
due wholly to Tudor dislike of disobedience
to the Lord's anointed, though this certainly
was one ruling motive. Elizabeth, undoubtedly,
throughout her entire reign, especially
in the case of the united provinces, was
averse to countenancing revolted subjects,
even when to do so was her evident interest;
but in this instance she was, in fact, guided
by other considerations in her conduct.
She seems to have wished in this, following
the traditional policy of English rulers, to
have taken upon herself the settlement of
Scotland; and she did not choose that that
kingdom should be revolutionized without
her sanction. She also had a particular
aversion to Knox and the Reforming leaders;
and very probably her sagacious advisers
may have foreseen that the rule of
Murray and his associates was far from secure.
These motives probably influenced
her policy in not siding with the Regent and
his followers; and in one respect the event
vindicated, in a great measure, her cautious
prudence. Though the infant James was
formally crowned, though the Reformed
Church was established in Scotland, and
Murray proved himself an able ruler, a
strong reaction set in in favour of the imprisoned
queen; and though unquestionably
the great mass of the nation remained
completely hostile, she was able to rally a
party sufficient to cause a violent counter-revolution.
The numerous adherents of the
old Church, the whole body of the Catholic
clergy, and a large minority of the Scottish
nobility enlisted themselves on the side of
Mary Stuart; they were joined by some of
the politicians and patriots whose one idea
was the giving a Scottish sovereign to England;
and pity for misfortune, the recollection
of rare beauty and great gifts, and that
strange loyalty which so often has shown
itself superior to the sense of right, of justice,
and of the successful cause, contributed
to swell the ranks of her followers.
Mr. Burton describes the escape from Lochleven,
and the stirring incidents of the
struggle which ensued, with much research
and even animation; but we can only refer
our readers to them. The unimportant battle
of Langside showed that, however imposing
it was in name, the party of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
queen was not supported in any degree by
the Scottish nation; a defeat, though little
more than a skirmish, was sufficient to
overthrow her career, and to compel her
forthwith to leave her kingdom. After her
flight, in which she found few friends, Mary
Stuart was obliged to take refuge in England,
abandoning for ever a country in
which she had played one of the most
astonishing parts that have ever fallen to the
lot of woman, and which, excepting a revolutionary
faction, had repudiated her for
crimes which had effaced the sentiment of
former affection.</p>

<p>We agree generally with Mr. Burton in
his estimate of Elizabeth's policy when her
rival had placed herself in her power. That
policy was not generous or high-minded;
it was even temporising, doubtful, and tentative;
but it was essentially crafty and prudent.
To have listened to the petition of
the Scottish queen, and to have sent her
over to France or Spain, would have been to
arm the enemies of England with a weapon
of the most perilous kind, and, at the same
time, to make all Protestant Scotland permanently
hostile. On the other hand,
Elizabeth refused to hand her guest over to
the Scottish lords, in part certainly from
compassionate feelings, in part from her
known antipathy to rebellion against a lawful
sovereign, and in part from a well-founded
doubt whether the government of Murray
was really stable, and whether, if the
surrender were made, a violent reaction
would not follow. A middle course was
artfully struck out, which had the advantage
of seeming just, of ruining the fair fame of
Mary Stuart, and depriving her of all moral
influence, and which, moreover, gave her the
right of intervening in Scottish affairs, and
making England the arbiter of them.
Under the form of a charge against her revolted
subjects, Mary Stuart was really put
on her trial before the most distinguished
personages in England; and the result of
the inquiry was that she was disgraced in
public opinion, that her detention was in
part justified, and that, though made somewhat
dependent on England, Murray and
the Regency were confirmed in power.
This is what Elizabeth and Cecil had aimed
at, and whatever may be thought of the
dignity of their conduct, it fell in with the
interests of England; and it was, on the
whole, inspired by wisdom. Mr. Burton
describes at much length the conferences at
York and Hampton Court, but we have no
space to dwell on his narrative. The only
real question was as to the guilt of Mary,
and of this, like ourselves, he has no doubt.
The evidence contained in the casket letters
is confirmed by numerous subordinate
proofs; the authenticity of the letters themselves
was hardly questioned in that generation,
and not a single member of the
Commission&mdash;though several were devoted
to Mary&mdash;not even, apparently, her own advocates,
attempted to challenge this decisive
fact. As the Scottish queen has found defenders
of the boldest kind, even in our day,
we quote a part of Mr. Burton's comments:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'There are two theories on which the guilty
conclusion to which the casket documents
point has been resisted with great perseverance
and gallantry; the one is, that, as we now
see them, they have been tampered with;
the other, that they are forgeries from the
beginning. All questions raised on the prior
theory, are at once settled by the fact that
those to whom the letters were first shown,
drew conclusions from them as damnatory
as any they can now suggest.... The
theory of an entire forgery seems not to have
occurred to any of those friends or foes of the
queen who saw the documents.... And
it is impossible not to connect the stream of
contemporary impugnment with a notable peculiarity
in these documents. They are as
affluent in petty details about matters personally
known to persons who could have contradicted
them if false, that the forger could
only have scattered around him, in superfluous
profusion, allusions that must have been traps
for his own detection. Wherever any of
these petty matters come to the surface elsewhere,
it is in a shape to confirm the accuracy
of the mention made of them in these letters....
Though this controversy has produced
dazzling achievements of ingenuity and sagacity,
I would be inclined not so much to press
technical points of evidence, as to look to the
general tone and character of the whole story.
In this view nothing appears to me more natural
than the casket letters. They fit entirely
into their places in the dark history of events.'&mdash;(Vol.
iv. p. 436, <i>et seq.</i>)
</p>
</div>

<p>Events showed that Elizabeth and Cecil
were right in calculating that the power of
Murray did not rest on a secure foundation.
The Regent was one of the best governors
who ever appeared in Scottish history; he
was honourable, upright, firm, yet humane;
and during his too brief rule he maintained
order in a manner unknown in that generation.
The religious movement, too, of
which he was the unselfish and sincere
champion, was followed by the great mass
of the nation; and though most of the
Reforming lords were simply greedy for the
spoils of Popery, Knox and his adherents
went with them, and, as a people, Scotland
was sincerely Protestant. These combined
elements of power, however, did not render
the Government safe, and it was exposed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
a series of formidable attacks which kept
the country for some years in anarchy.
The united parties which Langside had
quelled again formed a perilous coalition;
and the old Church, many of the great feudal
lords, and the statesmen who wished
above all things to place a Stuart on the
Tudor throne, once more rallied in behalf
of Queen Mary. The leading spirit of this
ill-assorted league was that singular character,
Maitland of Lethington, one of the
ablest men of that stirring age, yet, with his
keen intellect and clear brain, an enthusiast
possessed by a vain idea. Long one of the
chief opponents of the queen, he had yielded
to the alluring prospect&mdash;held out to
him skilfully by his wife, one of the captive's
principal attendants&mdash;of making Mary
Stuart the sovereign of Great Britain, and he
now schemed and plotted in her cause in
conjunction with his worst former enemies.
At the same time, Elizabeth maintained a
dubious attitude towards the Regency:
wishing to stand well with the Catholic
Powers, with whom for the moment she
was at peace, and always disliking undutiful
subjects, she more than once declared she
would release the queen; and though we do
not believe she was sincere in this, the effect
was to weaken the Scottish Government,
and to add strength to its many adversaries.
Besides, Elizabeth contrived to stir the sense
of Scottish patriotism to the quick by an
imperious demand for the extradition of
one of the leaders of the Northern rebellion;
and the cry went forth that the pusillanimous
Regency was the dishonoured
instrument of Tudor oppression, and that
Scotland under her lawful sovereign should
again vindicate her independence with the
assistance of her old ally, France. The result
was a furious civil war, of which, after
the murder of the Regent, the issue was for
a time doubtful; and, as Mr. Burton correctly
observes, Scotland was more thoroughly
and widely divided than she had been
at any former period. An event, however,
which in that age revolutionized the politics
of Europe, was, in Scotland also, to change
the situation. The atrocious massacre of St.
Bartholomew stirred to its depths a people
essentially Protestant, confounded the adherents
of Mary Stuart, made the French alliance
a source of dread, and threw the nation
on the side of the Regency, now in the
hands of the vigorous Morton. At the
same time, it showed Elizabeth that the interest
of England compelled her to support
'the lords,' Knox, and the Reformation;
that in Mary she had an implacable enemy;
and that her only chance was to strike in
boldly with Morton and the national Protestant
party. The union of these forces was
decisive; Morton and his adherents, backed
generally by the spirit of an indignant people,
overcame quickly Mary Stuart's faction;
an English army invaded Scotland, and the
siege and fall of the Castle of Edinburgh
put an end to the French alliance, destroyed
for ever the chances of the Scottish queen,
and, with the death of Lethington and
Grange, extinguished the prospects of her
cause.</p>

<p>Mr. Burton thus describes this conjunction,
one of the turning-points in the history of
Scotland:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'For the future three great disturbing forces,
prolific in action, are seen no more. In the
first place, the game of conquest has been entirely
played out by England. We may say,
perhaps, that it came to an end with the Reformation;
but there was still room for it, and it
might start up any day. Now its place was occupied.
On both sides of the border, men looked
to another solution of the problem, how the
two nations should be made into one. Secondly,
it followed that there was no longer danger
from abroad, since French protection was no
longer needed. The ancient league, if not dead,
was paralyzed, and all its long romance of heroism
and kindly sympathy was at an end....
Thirdly, Queen Mary has no longer a
place in the history of her country. She was
in one sense busier than ever ... but in
Scotland, however many may have been the
hearts secretly devoted to her, her name passed
out of the arena of political action and discussion.'&mdash;(Vol.
v. 384.)
</p>
</div>

<p>After these events the history of Scotland
passes through a period of intrigues and factions,
in the midst of which James I. grew
up. He abandoned his ill-fated mother, and
the Catholic Powers endeavoured to make
his youth the instrument of their designs.
The ascendancy of D'Aubigny and Arran
marks the short-lived triumph of this policy.
These attempts, however, were in the long
run fruitless; the great body of the people
adhered to Protestantism and the English alliance;
the Kirk and the Reforming nobles
worked together against the common enemy;
and James, as he grew to man's estate, had sagacity
enough to see the strongest side, and
to direct accordingly his public conduct. Mr.
Burton omits to dwell upon the base selfishness
of the young king, in throwing over
the unhappy princess, to whom he owed the
love of a son. But morally he was always a
coward; and the prospect of the inheritance
of England, and the dread of alienating Elizabeth,
was more than enough to determine
his purpose. The extremely unsettled state
of Scotland, after the death of the Regent
Morton, and the rudeness and barbarism of
its government, appear in the frequency and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
sudden violence of the changes which took
place in its rulers; and it seems to have been
assumed, that whatever faction had possession
of the person of the king, was rightly
invested with supreme authority. In these
circumstances, as may be supposed, the progress
of Scotland was only slow; the face of
the country seemed scarred with the marks
of desolation and war; the nation was rent
by intestine troubles; and travellers from
England drew marked contrasts between the
aspect of the Southern land at peace under
the Tudor sceptre, and that of its lawless
Northern neighbour. Nevertheless, the
course of events tended inevitably to the approaching
union of the two crowns under a
common sovereign&mdash;invasion from England
had wholly ceased&mdash;and though the aged
Elizabeth would not acknowledge the title of
James to her glorious throne, every politician
in both countries was aware that the time
was not distant, when the policy inaugurated
by Edward I., and pursued by every great
English monarch, of joining together the
whole of the island, would be consummated
without civil war or bloodshed. Meanwhile
the tragic and striking figure which had
played such an awful and mournful part in
the historical drama of the two kingdoms
had passed away for ever from the stage, and
the terrible career of Mary Stuart had been
cut short by the Fotheringay headsman. Mr.
Burton properly does not dilate on the incidents
of her melancholy life during the later
years of her long imprisonment, for they
hardly belong to his subject, but his estimate
of them is generally correct. Mary Stuart,
after the final overthrow of her party in Scotland,
transferred her energies to intriguing
with the Continental powers; and it can admit
of no question that she continued to
maintain her claims to the crown of England,
that she plotted directly against the life of
Elizabeth, and that she kept England in a
state of apprehension, intolerable to the Parliament
and nation. She was a conspirator
of the worst kind, and deserved the death
she bravely encountered; and the crooked
policy, the vacillation, and the duplicity of
her rival towards her prisoner, should not
render us blind to the real issue.</p>

<p>While, in circumstances such as these,
Scotland was working out her political destiny,
her ecclesiastical and religious reformation
was being developed and matured. In
no country, perhaps, in Europe had the
Church of Rome been so grossly corrupt as
in the northern part of our island; it had
been the appanage of a vicious court, and the
instrument of coarse spiritual tyranny; and
in none, accordingly, was the reaction against
it more rapid, popular, and thoroughly decisive.
Although Beaton and the men of his
faction had endeavoured to associate the defence
of Popery with the spirit of stern opposition
to the Southron, their policy had, in
the long run, failed; and before Mary Stuart
ascended the throne, Scotland, as a nation,
had become Protestant. The grand and striking
figure of Knox was the chief exponent of
this movement; but it is idle to imagine that
even Knox could have changed the spiritual
life of Scotland, if the people had not been
generally with him. As usually has happened,
the baser elements of selfishness mingled
with this revolution; and the support given
by most of the Scottish nobles to the overthrow
of Romanism was chiefly prompted by
a greedy appetite for the spoils of the fallen
Church. Nevertheless, the Reformation
took firm root; the old ecclesiastical system
of the country and its ancient faith were violently
changed; and the accession of Murray
to the Regency marks the period of this great
transformation. Mr. Burton's account of the
new Church which rose on the ruins of its
predecessor, and of its peculiar ritual and
doctrine, is one of the most interesting parts
of his book, and abounds in learning and
sound criticism. The Scottish Kirk was
founded upon the model of the Huguenot
Church of France; with a large admixture
of lay elements, it had the same definite and
strong organization, and the same tendency
to create what was a powerful priesthood all
but in name; and its teaching exemplified
the austerity and strictness of the theology of
Calvin. From the first, accordingly, it was
calculated to encourage pretensions among
the ministry, and to become an <i>imperium in
imperio</i>, not without risk of collision with the
State; and its whole system, in its excess, led
to fanaticism and contempt of civil authority.
We transcribe a few passages from Mr.
Burton's description of the Second Book of
Discipline of the Scottish Kirk, a specimen
of its general principles:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'It sets forth that, "as the ministers and
others of the ecclesiastical estate are subject to
the magistrate civil, so ought the person of the
magistrate be subject to the Kirk spiritually,
and in ecclesiastical government." Further:&mdash;"The
civil power should command the spiritual
to exercise and do their office according to
the word of God; the spiritual rulers should
require the Christian magistrate to minister
justice and punish vice, and to maintain the liberty
and quietness of the Kirk within their
bounds." Nothing could be on its face a
fairer distribution. The civil power was entitled
to command the spiritual to do its duty; but
then the magistrate was not to have authority
to "execute the censures of the Church, nor
yet prescribe any rule how it should be done."
This is entirely in the hands of the Church;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
but in enforcing it the State is the Church's servant,
for it is the magistrate's duty to "assist
and maintain the discipline of the Kirk, and
punish them civilly that will not obey the discipline
of the same." Thus the State could give
no effective orders to the Church, but the
Church could order the State to give material
effect to its rules and punishments. It was the
State's duty, at the same time, to preserve for
the Church its whole patrimony; and we have
seen that this meant all the vast wealth which
had been gathered up by the old Church.
Among the prerogatives of the clergy, it was
further declared that "they have power to abrogate
and abolish all statutes and ordinances
concerning ecclesiastical matters that are found
noisome and unprofitable, and agree not with
the time, or, are abused by the people."'&mdash;(Vol.
v. 470.)
</p>
</div>

<p>While Knox and his generation survived,
the tendencies of the new establishment were
prevented from fully showing themselves.
The great Reformer was at bottom moderate;
he had a real reverence for the powers
that be, however he abhorred Mary Stuart.
The lay lords had sufficient influence to control
the ministry throughout the country; and
the presence of a common danger compelled
the Scottish Protestants to uphold the Government.
But, when the Kirk had become
settled, and the Reformation was completely
secure, dissensions rapidly grew up between
the spiritual and civil powers, and the Presbyterian
clergy began to assume that attitude
in the affairs of Scotland, which led, afterwards,
to such momentous consequences.
The leader of the new school of divines was
the celebrated Melville, thus described by Mr.
Burton:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'Knox had a respect for hereditary rank
which only yielded to a higher duty, when, as
the successor of the prophets of old, he had to
announce the law of God even to the highest.
Melville, though born to a higher position, was
more of the leveller. He was the type of a
class who, to as much of the fierce fanaticism
of the Huguenots as the Scottish character
could receive, added the stern classical republicanism
of Buchanan.'&mdash;(Vol. v. 404.)
</p>
</div>

<p>An organization of this kind, supported
by such spiritual leaders, ere long displayed
its natural tendencies. The Kirk, with its
powerful local ministry, connected with each
other by numerous links, attempted to revive
in Scotland the pretensions of the old dominant
Church, and it succeeded in creating a
vast spiritual power, often in conflict with
the authority of the State. The principal
fact in Scottish history, during the last years
of the sixteenth century and the first of the
seventeenth, was the opposition given, by
the Presbyterian clergy, to the acts and even
the rights of the Crown; and though the
conduct of James I. was, as usual, arrogant
and unwise, he was subjected to extreme
provocation. The enthusiasm which followed
the defeat of the Armada, the supposed
inclination of the king to High Church, and
even Romanist doctrines, and the open favour
he showed to several of the old Catholic
Scottish houses, gave strength to the champions
of the Kirk; and for some time, as
he ruefully exclaimed, he was not a ruler in
his own dominions. The formal abolition
of Episcopacy in Scotland&mdash;the institution
had existed in name even after the iconoclasm
of Knox&mdash;marks the highest point of
Presbyterian ascendancy; and, more than
once, the king and his council were compelled
to yield to the demands put forward
by those whom he called the 'Popes of Edinburgh.'
Undoubtedly, however, if James
had been a really able and popular ruler, he
could have vindicated his supreme authority,
and the national estates, which even at this
juncture often showed jealousy of the heads
of the Kirk, would have upheld the prerogatives
of the Crown. As it was, Scotland
was divided by a contest between the Church
and the State, and the Presbyterian Hildebrands
assumed an attitude which contributed
afterwards to many troubles. We
quote a passage that gives an idea of
the bickerings between the king and the
clergy:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'Entering in the cabinet with the king alone,
I show his Majesty that the Commissioners of
the General Assembly, with certain other
brethren ordained to watch for the well of the
Kirk in so dangerous a time, had convened at
Cupar. At the which word the king interrupts
me, and angrily quarrels our meeting, alleging
it was without warrant and seditious, making
ourselves and the country to conceive fear
where there was no cause. To the which I,
beginning to reply in my manner, Mr. Andrew
could not abide it, but brake off upon the king
in so zealous, powerful, and unresistible a
manner, that, howbeit the king used his authority
in most crabbed and choleric manner,
Mr. Andrew bore him down, and uttered the
commission as from the mighty God, calling
the king but "God's silly vassal," and, taking
him by the sleeve, says this in effect, through
much hot reasoning and many interruptions,
"Sir, we will humbly reverence your Majesty,
always, namely, in public. But, since we have
this occasion to be with your Majesty in private,
and the truth is, you are brought in extreme
danger, both of your life and crown,
and, with you, the country and Kirk of Christ
is like to wreck for not telling you the truth,
and giving of you a faithful counsel&mdash;we must
discharge our duty therein, or else be traitors,
both to Christ and you! And therefore, Sir,
as divers times before, so now again, I must
tell you, there are two kings and two kingdoms
in Scotland. <i>There is Christ Jesus the King,</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
<i>and His Kingdom the Kirk, whose subject King
James the Sixth is&mdash;and of his kingdom, not
a king, nor a lord, nor a head, but a member!"</i>'&mdash;(Vol.
vi. 81.)
</p>
</div>

<p>While seeds of trouble were thus growing
up in the contests between the Kirk and the
Crown, the great Tudor queen had passed
away, and James became monarch of the
three kingdoms. Both England and Scotland
recognised in him the principle of hereditary
right, for there was little in his character
or antecedents to recommend him as
a national sovereign. In his own country
he had become unpopular, and in England
he was chiefly known as one who had basely
betrayed his mother, who had intrigued with
Elizabeth to obtain her throne, and who had
no sympathy with the great alliance with
France and the United Provinces in the war
with Spain. James, however, encountered
no opposition in assuming the sceptre of
these realms; and his progress to London
from the North&mdash;described graphically by
Mr. Burton&mdash;was a scene of continuous joy
and festivity. The king, at least, had ample
reason to feel delight at the happy change
which had come over his life and prospects.
He left a poor and distracted country&mdash;where
his reign had long been a long scene of
trouble, and where he was being continually
reviled by those who, in his phrase, 'agreed
as well with monarchy as the devil with
Christ'&mdash;for rich, peaceful, and well-ordered
England; and he might well expect a season
of repose amidst the blandishments of a
Tudor hierarchy, and the submissive acts of
Tudor courtiers. For some time he was not
disappointed, and what between the unctuous
flattery of prelates, who said that 'he spake
like the Spirit,' and of nobles who vied with
each other in adulation, James must have
thought himself translated to a sphere not
unworthy even of his own estimate of himself.
Before long, however, he was destined
to find out that in England, as well as Scotland,
he was to earn the contempt and dislike
of his subjects. Essentially timid and short-sighted,
he abandoned the foreign policy of
Elizabeth; he disgusted Englishmen by his
open preference for worthless and needy
Scottish favourites; and in a few years he
found himself in antagonism with the House
of Commons, now becoming a real image of
the nation, and with the tremendous force
of Puritanism already growing into ascendancy
in England. Mr. Burton gives us,
from a contemporary chronicler, this sketch
of the ignoble monarch:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'He was of a middle stature, more corpulent
through his clothes than in his body, yet fat
enough; his clothes ever being made large and
easy, the doublets quilted for stiletto proof;
his breeches in great plaits and full stuffed.
He was naturally of a timid disposition, which
was the greatest reason of his quilted doublets.
His eyes large, ever rolling after any
stranger came in his presence, inasmuch as
many for shame have left the room, being out
of countenance. His beard was very thin;
his tongue too large for his mouth, which ever
made him speak full in the mouth, and made
him drink very uncomely as if eating his drink,
which came out into the cup on each side of
his mouth. His skin was as soft as taffeta
sarcenet, which felt so because he never washed
his hands&mdash;only rubbed his finger-ends
slightly with the wet end of a napkin. His
legs were very weak, having had, it was
thought, some foul play in his youth, or rather
before he was born, that he was not able to
stand at seven years of age&mdash;that weakness
made him ever leaning on other men's shoulders.'&mdash;(Vol.
vi. 162.)
</p>
</div>

<p>As is well known, the dislike entertained
for James in England was in part owing to
the favour he showed to Scotch favourites.
The nation, too, abounding in keen adventurers&mdash;poor,
hardy, and pushing&mdash;came in
for a share of this feeling; and the wits
and satirists of the day indulged in sarcasms
on the greedy race who crossed the border
in hungry swarms to feed on the wealth of
of the well-fed Southron. We quote from
one of these pasquinades:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">'Bonny Scot, we all witness can,</p>
<p class="i1">That England hath made thee a gentleman.</p>

</div>

<p>During the years that followed the union
of the crowns, Scotland made considerable
material progress, though still troubled by
occasional disorder. The strife which for
ages had made the border a theatre of desolation
and rapine came, to a great extent, to
an end, and signs of good husbandry and
growing comfort began to appear in this
wild district. The great house of Huntly,
'the cock of the North,' and the terror of
the Reformation party, was balanced by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
rival house of Argyle, and the barbarous
Highlands were reduced in some degree to
subjection to the Crown. The wealth of
Scotland increased apace under the influence
of trade comparatively free; and the political
consequences were important in weakening
the connection of the country with
France. At the same time, the authority of
the law, which, since the death of Murray,
had been feeble, began to be again vindicated.
The following, from a contemporary
eye-witness, will show the progress of this
revolution:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'The Islanders oppressed the Highlandmen;
the Highlanders tyrannized over their Lowland
neighbours; the powerful and violent in the
country domineered over the lives and goods of
their weak neighbours; the Borderers triumphed
in the immunity of their violences to the ports
of Edinburgh; that treasons, murthers, burnings,
thefts, reifs, heirships, hocking of oxen,
breaking of mills, destroying of growing corns,
and barbarities of all sorts were exercised in
all parts of the country&mdash;no place nor person
being exempt or inviolable&mdash;Edinburgh being
the ordinary place of butchery, revenge, and
daily fights.... These and all other
abominations, which, settled by inveterate custom
and impunity, appeared to be of desperate
remeid, had been so repressed, punished, and
abolished by your Majesty's care, power, and
expenses, as no nation on earth could now compare
with our prosperities.'&mdash;(Vol. vi. 283.)
</p>
</div>

<p>Yet, though Scotland was growing in
wealth, and the authority of the Crown was
increasing, the nation, during the last years
of this reign, abounded in discontent and
disorder. The Scots seem to have felt
bitterly the transference of their ancient
Royal House to an alien and lately hostile
country; and though they had no affection
for James, they resented the visible loss of
the monarchy. A High Commissioner and
Council at Edinburgh could not supply the
place of the sovereign; the evils of absenteeism
began to be felt in the capital and the
rural districts; and complaints were made
that what had been a kingdom was now
treated as a subject province. Dissatisfaction
of this kind, however, was small, compared
to the angry sentiments engendered
by the long-standing quarrel between James
and the Presbyterian clergy. Puffed up by
the oriental flattery of the courtiers and prelates
at Whitehall, that sagacious ruler formed
the design of revolutionizing the Kirk in
Scotland, and of restoring the mode of
Church government which the Reformation
had violently overthrown; and he proceeded
to his work with a timid arrogance which
provoked contempt and indignation alike.
Many circumstances concurred to second a
purpose, which in the next generation was to
culminate in disaster and ruin to the House
of Stuart. The pretensions of the Presbyterian
ministry had disgusted many moderate
persons; their despotic claims to spiritual
domination had aroused the jealousy of
the national estates; a large party among
the nobility were ready to comply with the
wishes of James; and though the nation was
fanatically Protestant, a minority of it had
no sympathy with what they thought was
sacerdotal tyranny. The result was that,
without seeming difficulty, Episcopacy was
again set up in Scotland; the king was enabled
to boast complacently that he had
built up the chief pillar of the throne, and
he even succeeded in introducing innovations
into the simple ritual which had been established
after the Reformation. James, however,
prudently abstained from allying aristocratic
selfishness with popular feeling, and
did not venture to lay hands on the forfeited
possessions of the Church, long in the ownership
of lay families; and, on the whole,
notwithstanding the tone of pompous dictation
assumed by him, he avoided wounding
powerful class interests when he insisted
upon the return to 'Prelacy.' His bishops,
indeed, were very different personages from
the mitred tyrants who, a century before,
had lorded it over thousands of vassals, and
had exasperated Scotland by their pride and
wickedness. They were, for the most part,
needy and insignificant men, who thought a
great deal more of 'making ends meet,' and
of winning the royal ear by adulation, than
of asserting the claims of the Church, and
they had little in common with the class of
the Beatons. Mr. Burton gives us a most
interesting account of their difficulties and
privations, and of the ignoble means some of
them took to keep up their state. We quote
an anecdote to that effect:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'When I was in England his Majesty did
promise to me the making of two serjeants-at-law,
and I travailed with some to that effect,
with whom I covenanted, if they were made
serjeants by my means they should give me
eleven hundred pounds sterling the piece, and
the projector a hundred pounds of it for his
pains. Now I have received ane letter, that
these same men are called to be serjeants, and
has received his Majesty's writ to that effect,
and desires me to write to them anent that indenting.
I beseech you to know if his Majesty's
will is I be paid by that course or not.'&mdash;(Vol.
vi. 265.)
</p>
</div>

<p>This change, however, though it did not
provoke a violent revolution in Scotland,
created a large amount of discontent. The
Presbyterian clergy declared that the Kirk
had been contaminated and profaned; they
kept up a sullen agitation; and many of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
their congregations only awaited an opportunity
to revolt openly. Whenever James
paid a visit to his Scottish dominions, which
he occasionally did, his devout respect for
the Anglican ritual, his reverence for 'my
Lords, the Bishops,' and his assiduous care
about forms and vestments, aroused indignation
and contempt, and before his death it
had become evident that a great religious
movement was at hand. The King, however,
continued to avert a passionate explosion
during his life; he avoided acts of
high-handed oppression; and it is remarkable
that he expressed an unfavourable opinion
of the wrong-headed personage who in the
next reign was to precipitate the catastrophe
and bring his son to ruin. We quote James's
account of the character of Laud:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'The plain truth is, that I keep Laud back
from all places of rule and authority because
I find he hath a restless spirit, and cannot see
when matters are well, but loves to toss and
change, and to bring things to a pitch of reformation
floating in his own brain, which may
endanger the steadfastness of that which is in
a good pass, God be praised. I speak not at
random. He hath made himself known to me
to be such a one; for when, three years since,
I had obtained of the Assembly of Perth to
consent to five articles of order and decency
in correspondence with this Church of England,
I gave them promise by attestation of faith
made, that I would try their obedience no further
anent ecclesiastic affairs. Yet this man
hath pressed me to incite them to a nearer
conjunction with the liturgy and canons of
this nation.'&mdash;(Vol. vi. 339.)
</p>
</div>

<p>The death of James, in 1625, was the inauguration
of a new era in Scotland. The
king, though full of arrogant pretensions,
was timid, feeble, and not without a certain
kind of political insight; and if he had
irritated and alarmed the nation, he did not
venture to outrage its feelings or to assail
some of its most powerful interests. His
successor, naturally a firmer man, and taught
to believe the odious doctrines of passive
obedience and divine right, had no scruples
in overbearing opposition, however stern
and national, to the line of policy he had
marked out for himself; and the conscientiousness
he undoubtedly possessed with respect
to certain cardinal principles, made him
obstinate in carrying them out in government.
Besides, he seems to have really
thought it was no part of the duty of a king
to keep faith with ministers or subjects, that
something in his office placed him outside
the pale of ordinary moral obligations; and
in addition, like all the Stuarts, he was
especially addicted to favourites, and to lend
an ear to their unwise counsels. Such a
man, a bad ruler as it were on principle,
was calculated to precipitate the great revolution
which in England and Scotland alike
had been gradually in course of development.
As Mr. Burton truly observes, the
teasing, fitful, and hesitating attempts of
James to cross the will of his people, were
as nothing to the steady and resolute efforts
with which Charles endeavoured to accomplish
the ends which from the first he had
clearly in view. The battle in Scotland, as
might have been expected, commenced upon
the affairs of the Church; and the king,
with singular unwisdom, contrived to unite
against him most of the nobility, the Kirk,
and the bulk of the people, and to stir to
its depths the national sentiment. There
can be little doubt that Charles intended to
force the Anglican system on Scotland, and
to introduce into that kingdom the well-endowed
State Church, the rich courtier prelates,
'the midge-madge of doctrine,' and
the gorgeous ritual which he considered
divine in England. His first step was audaciously
to claim the resumption of the revenues
of the old Church of Scotland, which
had been forfeited at the Reformation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'A proclamation announced the general
revocation by the new king of all grants by
the Crown, and all acquisitions to the prejudice
of the Crown, whether before or after his
father's Act of Annexation in 1587. This
was virtually the proclamation of that contest
of which King Charles was destined never to
see the end. It proposed to sweep into the
royal treasury the whole of the vast ecclesiastical
estates which had passed into the hands
of the territorial potentates from the Reformation
downwards, since it went back to things
done before King James's annexation.'&mdash;(Vol.
vi. 355.)
</p>
</div>

<p>By this wicked and insensate measure,
Charles made enemies of all the powerful
men, the leaders of the nobility of Scotland,
who were in possession of ecclesiastical
property, and he gave the whole nation a
significant example of the iniquities of mere
arbitrary power. But he was not satisfied
with exasperating a class; he proceeded to
touch to the very quick the religious and
patriotic feelings of the nation. At the
stroke of a pen he completely changed the
ecclesiastical polity of Scotland, by proclaiming
his right to make canons for the
Kirk; and he not only introduced many of
these ordinances, but he peremptorily enjoined
the use of forms and symbols in worship
for many years detested in Scotland.
This was done, too, with a coarse contempt
of Scottish sentiment which was especially
galling; the innovations being thrust upon
the country by English prelates, regarded as
aliens. We quote a specimen of scenes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
which, doubtless, were not unfrequent at
this juncture:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'At the back of this altar, covered with
tapestry, there was ane rich tapestry wherein
the crucifix was curiously wrought; and as
those bishops who were in service passed by
this crucifix they were seen to bow their knee,
and beck, which, with their habit, was noticed,
and bred great fear of inbringing of Popery....
The Archibishop of St. Andrew's
and four bishops did "the service" "with
white rochets and white sleeves and copes of
gold, having blue silk to their foot." Bishop
Laud took Glasgow, and thrust him from the
king with these words, "Are you a Churchman,
and wants the coat of your order?"'&mdash;(Vol.
vi. 376.)
</p>
</div>

<p>In this kind of foreign innovation, Laud,
now made a royal favourite, was badly and
conspicuously eminent. This meddling priest,
who thought that he could bind the faith of
two nations within his formulas, was made
an overseer of the Scottish prelates, and presented
to them with insolent rudeness the
ecclesiastical policy they were to adopt.
There is reason to believe they disliked him
heartily, while he was execrated by the Presbyterian
clergy. We quote a few words
from one of his dictatorial letters:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'You are immutably to hold this rule, and
that by his Majesty's strict and most special
command&mdash;namely, that yourself, or the Lord
Ross, or both of you together, do privately acquaint
the Earl of Traquair; ... and
the earl will readily do all good offices for the
Church that come within his power, according
to all such commands as he shall receive, either
immediately from the king, or otherwise by
direction of his Majesty from myself.'&mdash;(Vol.
vi. 386.)
</p>
</div>

<p>By this policy, Charles had contrived to
unite the great mass of the nation against
him. The descendants of the lay lords of
the Reformation, the moderate men who
reverenced law, the still powerful Presbyterian
clergy and their congregations throughout
the country were alarmed, irritated, and
provoked; and signs of discontent were
manifest even in the Council of National
Estates. The last drop that made the cup
overflow was the publication of the famous
Liturgy of Laud, which, itself odious to all
true Protestants, was forced on the people
in a manner certain to exasperate a high-spirited
country. Mr. Burton criticises at
length and learnedly this celebrated attempt
on the faith of Scotland: it must suffice to
say that the new Liturgy was in conflict
with all the forms of Scottish worship, devised,
as we have seen, from the Huguenots,
which had existed since the Reformation.
The scenes that ensued are well known, and
it is not necessary to dwell on them. The
'rabblings' of the angry mobs at Edinburgh,
Jenny Geddes and her 'devout sisters,' the
terror that fell on the appointed bishops,
were merely symptoms of the deep indignation
which had taken possession of the people
of Scotland; and, in a short time, a general
opposition was organized against the
king and his government. How ignorant
Charles and his ministers in England were
of the tempest they had waked, will be
seen from the following passage:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'The truth is, there was so little curiosity
either in the court or the country to know
anything of Scotland, or what was done there,
that when the whole nation was solicitous to
know what passed weekly in Germany and
Poland, and all other parts of Europe, no man
ever enquired what was doing in Scotland;
nor had that kingdom a place or mention of
one page of any gazette.'&mdash;(Vol. vi. 451.)
</p>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile the opposition to the king in
Scotland had assumed a formidable shape,
and throughout the country crowds of 'supplicants,'
demanding a repeal of the obnoxious
measures which had been passed during
the preceding years, had formed themselves
into regular assemblies, connected with a
central convocation, which expressed angrily
the will of the people. It has been supposed
that the Council of Edinburgh connived, to
say the least, with this movement; it certainly
recognised the representative quality
of the delegates by treating officially with
them; and the institution of the celebrated
'Tables' marks the commencement of the
great revolution. Charles, however, and his
councillors were unrelenting; and Laud especially
distinguished himself in invoking
fire and sword upon the audacious 'rebels.'
The 'Tables,' that is, the leading men of the
nation, acknowledged as a lawful power, in
direct opposition to the Sovereign, resolved
to make their authority felt; and the famous
compact of the 'Covenant' found the entire
sympathy of all classes with them. The
Covenant, in fact, was the solemn protest of
Scotland against the wrong done by the
king. The following, from a contemporary
account, shows the deep enthusiasm with
which it was welcomed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'Gentlemen and noblemen carried copies
about in their portmanteaus or pockets, requiring
subscriptions thereunto, and using their
utmost endeavours with their friends in private
for to subscribe. It was subscribed publicly
in churches, ministers exhorting their people
thereunto. It was also subscribed and sworn
privately. All had power to take the oath,
and were licensed and welcomed to come in;
and any that pleased had power and license for
to carry the Covenant about with him, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
give the oath to such as were willing to subscribe
and swear. And such was the zeal of
many subscribers, that for a while many subscribed
with tears on their cheeks; and it is
constantly reported that some did draw their
own blood, and used it in place of ink, to
underwrite their names.'&mdash;(Vol. vi. 488.)
</p>
</div>

<p>Charles now began to act after the fashion
which was to lead him at last to ruin and
death. He had not yet alienated the hearts
of his people, and timely concession and
simple justice would certainly have allayed
the tempest. But he resolved to dissimulate
with them, to hold out hopes that he
would comply with their requests, and, at
the same time, to prepare the means of chastising
them as audacious 'rebels.' He sent
Hamilton, as a commissioner, to Scotland,
with full power to redress grievances, with a
promise that a General Assembly and a free
Parliament should be convened; but he
secretly determined to put down opposition
by sheer military force. If Charles was not
what is called a 'bad man,' if he was not a
mere reckless and wicked tyrant, it must be
allowed that the detestable doctrines of kingcraft
had poisoned his understanding; he
acted on system, as though he were free
from all obligations of good faith with his
subjects. Mr. Burton gives us the following
letter, written to Hamilton at this juncture;
it is one of the worst extant specimens of
royal duplicity:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'And to this end I give you leave to flatter
them with what hopes you please....
This I have written to no other end than to
show you I will rather die than yield to those
impertinent and damnable demands, as you
rightly call them.... As the affairs
are now, I do not expect that you should declare
the adherers to the Covenant traitors until,
as I have already said, you have heard from
me that my fleet hath set sail for Scotland.'&mdash;(Vol.
vi. 505.)
</p>
</div>

<p>According to the promise given by the
king, a General Assembly was now held,
described fully by Mr. Burton. This great
convention met at Glasgow; and Episcopacy
was condemned and set aside, as in the days
of the first Reformation. Charles replied
by seizing Edinburgh Castle, and taking possession
of the chief Scottish fortresses; and
Hamilton openly issued proclamations denouncing
the Covenanters as audacious rebels.
Civil war broke out in 1639; and in a few
weeks, an irregular contest was raging in the
east and south-east, and threatening to overrun
the kingdom. At this juncture, Scotland
abounded with soldiers trained in the
Thirty Years' War, not mere mercenaries of
the Dalgetty type, but men really fitted to
command; and a resolution was formed to
march to the south, and to make an armed
demonstration against England. In an incredibly
short time, 22,000 men were arrayed
under the orders of Leslie, and making
for the English border&mdash;a force relatively
to the population of Scotland, of extraordinary
numerical amount, and a conclusive
proof of the enthusiasm of the country. The
composition of this army, led by some of
the noblest men in Scotland, shows all classes,
high and low, joined in the movement against
the king:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'Our crouners (that is, colonels) for the
most part were noblemen. Rothes, Lindsay,
Sinclair, had among them two full regiments,
at least, from Fife. Balcarras, a horse troop;
Loudon, Montgomery, Erskine, Boyd, Fleming,
Kirkcudbright, Yester, Dalhousie, Eglinton,
and others, either with whole or half regiments.
Montrose's regiment was above fifteen hundred
men.'&mdash;(Vol. vii. 56.)
</p>
</div>

<p>The Scottish army having reached the
Border, the king consented to the brief truce
known by the name of the Pacification of
Berwick. Once more Charles made specious
promises with a resolution to break faith:
the wishes of the nation were to be respected;
Episcopacy was not to be restored;
Presbyterianism was to be the form of
Church government; and the National Estates
were to sanction the reforms confirmed
by a paternal and high-minded sovereign.
The Parliament, however, was hardly assembled
before it was indefinitely prorogued;
and there is ample evidence that Charles intended,
as soon as an opportunity came, to invade
Scotland, and take summary vengeance.
At this juncture, the Scottish leaders unquestionably
remembered the 'Ancient League,'
and looked to France and Richelieu for aid;
and if we cannot approve their purpose, we
at least should remember the great provocation.
The king thought that the time had
arrived to inflict punishment on the 'rebels
of the North;' he felt assured that the old
English jealousy of a political connection between
Scotland and France would throw all
England upon his side; and he issued orders
for a general armament, for the invasion and
even the conquest of Scotland. But, at this
crisis, political sympathy got the better of
past national dislikes; and England, as a
people, was averse to aid the king in crushing
discontent beyond the Tweed. For a
series of years the government of Charles
had provoked indignation in England, only
less than that which existed in Scotland; the
tyranny of Strafford and the arrogance of
Laud had combined the Constitutional and
Puritan parties, and a great revolution was
fast approaching. The future chiefs of the
Long Parliament co-operated with the Scottish

malcontents; and Charles found it impossible
to collect a sufficient army to carry
out his purpose. Mr. Burton describes the
situation thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'The result is described by one on whom
heavy responsibility lay&mdash;the Earl of Northumberland,
who was to command the army of
the North: "Most of the ways that were relied
on for supplies of money have hitherto
failed us, and, for aught I know, we are likely
to become the most despised nation of Europe.
To the regiments that are now raising, we, for
want of money, have been able to advance but
fourteen days' pay&mdash;the rest must meet them
upon their march towards Selby, and for both
the horse and foot already in the North, we can,
for the present, send them but seven days'
pay." Those who were considered liable to
serve in the army resisted the conscription;
and when embodied, they were often so mutinous
as to be more dangerous to their officers
than they were likely to be to the enemy.'&mdash;(Vol.
vii. 99.)
</p>
</div>

<p>The Scottish army, as is well known, encountered
no opposition on the Tweed, and,
having taken Newcastle, was advancing
southwards, when its progress was stayed by
the Treaty of Ripon. The sword had been
struck out of the hands of the king; his
English subjects had refused to second his
efforts against their ancient enemies; and, in
England and Scotland alike, the national
cause was about to triumph. From this time,
the chiefs of the opposition to the court cooperated
in the two countries; and the acts
of the Long Parliament and the Scottish Estates
were, in a great degree, of the same
kind, and had objects almost similar. Mr.
Burton, however, correctly shows that Scotland
certainly has the honour of having inaugurated
this glorious resistance; but for
the resolution displayed by the nation, it is
not impossible that Stratford's scheme of
'Thorough' might have been successful for
many years, and the constitutional liberties
of England might have been suspended for
at least a generation. Mr. Burton describes
at some length the visit of the Scottish Commissioners
to London, and the first proceedings
of the Long Parliament; but we have
no space to dwell on a subject which, however
interesting and picturesque, belongs
more properly to the History of England.
In 1640-41, the Scottish Estates were convened
in accordance with the conditions of
the Treaty of Ripon, and it became evident,
at once, that the authority of the king would
be swept away by a violent revolution. This
Assembly, formerly little more than an instrument
of the will of the king, was now intent
on putting an end to the policy and the
power of Charles; it was overflowing with
religious zeal and with national, if not democratic
passion; and it resolved once for all
that the House of Stuart should no longer
trifle with the rights of Scotsmen. As Scotland
had suffered more grievously than England
from the tyranny of the court, the
legislation of the Estates was more violent
than that of the Long Parliament, and
marked more strongly with precipitate haste;
on the whole, it does not contrast favourably
with that of the English Assembly; but,
undoubtedly, not a few of its measures
served as precedents for the Long Parliament,
in the later stages of the conflict with
Charles. For instance, after destroying Episcopacy,
and sweeping away all the innovations
in Church and State of the twenty
years before, the Estates proceeded practically
to abolish the prerogatives of the
Crown in Scotland; and the course they
took seems to have suggested the Nineteen
Propositions of the Long Parliament:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'One of the points which the Estates had
determined to carry, was the appointment, by
themselves, of all public officers. The Secret
Council and the Court of Session were recast,
the appointments being made in two separate
Acts. In a general Act, applicable to
Government offices at large, the king's form of
appointment is treated with all reverence; but,
at the same time, it is to be exercised in each
instance "with the advice and approbation" of
the Estates.'&mdash;(Vol. vii. 140.)
</p>
</div>

<p>It was not to be expected, after this, that
a revolution could be avoided. Charles, unquestionably,
resolved to draw the sword as
soon as an opportunity offered; the Estates,
backed by the mass of the nation, were as
determined to maintain their advantage.
When such were the feelings on either side,
there is little use in examining with care how
or by whom the Civil War was commenced.
But, as in the case of the Five Members, so
in that of the mysterious Incident, the king
seems to have acted with that treacherous
malice which so often provoked the indignation
of his subjects; and after this event,
war was inevitable. The great Irish rebellion
of 1641 came to add fuel to the gathering
flame; and Scotland, like England, was
impressed with the belief that Charles had
connived at an infamous scheme of overthrowing
the colonists of Ireland, and of marshalling
a Papist Irish army to put down the
Estates and the Parliament. Mr. Burton examines
at some length the evidence against
the king in this matter, and certainly is not
inclined to acquit him; however that may
be, it is somewhat curious that he does not
allude to a most significant fact, that the
alleged commission to the rebellious Irish
was given under the great seal of Scotland,
and was said to be in the interest of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
Scotch, and that the Irish carefully avoided
to lay a hand, at first, on the Scottish colonists,
while they massacred wholesale their
English fellows. Civil war now broke out in
England and Scotland; and for some time,
as is well known, success inclined to the side
of the king. Mr. Burton describes the brilliant
campaigns of Montrose in the North
minutely and well; but he shows correctly
that they were mere raids, of which the importance
has been exaggerated; and Montrose
was defeated without difficulty, when
encountered by a really able soldier. The
real struggle was in the South; and Mr.
Burton, perhaps, underrates the extraordinary
efforts of Cromwell in restoring the Parliamentary
cause, and overestimates the
weight which Leslie and the Scottish army
threw into the balance. Undoubtedly, however,
Leslie and the Scots were auxiliaries
of extreme importance. We quote this
brief description of Marston Moor, where
Leslie and Cromwell commanded together:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'Prince Rupert headed one of those impetuous
attacks for which he was renowned, and
scattered before him the right of the allied
army under Fairfax and Leven. It was one
of those great blows that may confuse a whole
army; but the other half was in very competent
hands&mdash;those of Cromwell and David
Leslie. They beat back their opponents, not
by a rush, but a hard, steady fight, and were
on the enemy's ground, when Rupert returned
from a pursuit which he had carried too far.
He found that while he had been away pursuing
the defeated enemy, events behind him had
arranged matters for a second battle, in which
each occupied the ground that earlier in the
day, had belonged to the other side. The end
was an entire victory.'&mdash;(Vol. vii. 180.)
</p>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile the Solemn League and Covenant
had attested the Union of England and
Scotland, and the celebrated Assembly of
Divines at Westminster had been employed
in devising means for establishing one faith
in both kingdoms. The inherent difference
between the Protestantism of the two countries
was fully developed. The Scottish
Presbyterians, true to the narrowness and
bigotry of their peculiar tenets, claimed that
the Kirk was of Divine institution, and endeavoured
to compel a universal adoption of
its ritual and forms of worship. These vain
pretensions were strenuously opposed by the
Parliament, broad and Erastian in view, and
by the great mass of the Puritan party, trained
by the results of the persecution of years
to acknowledge the rights of freedom of conscience.
Disputes, leading to memorable
consequences, were the result of these divergent
views which Mr. Burton has fully set
forth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'To the Scottish covenanters the calling of
this Assembly, and the adoption of the Solemn
League and Covenant as revised by it, were
rapidly bringing on the consummation of that
great scheme of Divine Providence destined to
establish the Presbyterian polity over all mankind.
The government of the Church by a
General Assembly, Synod, Presbyteries, and
Kirk Sessions, was the divine form of Church
government, and all others must dissolve before
it.... The Parliament, however, had
other views, and skilfully prepared for the consummation.
There lurked at that time, in the
class of men who made the Parliament and the
influential circles, a disinclination to reconstruct
any strong priesthood.... The Brownists,
Independents, or Congregationalists, were a
large body in England, and had been growing,
even in Scotland, too rapidly for the peace of
the Covenanting party. Their principle was,
that there should be no combined system of
Church government, whether prelatic or Presbyterian,
but that each Christian congregation
should be a church in itself.'&mdash;(Vol. vii. 209.)
</p>
</div>

<p>The civil war had gone on during these
long and important discussions. The genius
of Cromwell and the power of his army had
everywhere overcome the Royalists; and the
great Republican had become the arbiter of
the situation, and supreme in England. In
these circumstances the auxiliary force of
the Scots became of little importance, and
jealousies had already begun to grow up between
the soldiers of the two nations. As
is well known, the unfortunate king repaired
to the Scottish camp, and the Scottish leaders
delivered him up to Commissioners of
the Parliament for a sum of money. We
quote Mr. Burton's account of this transaction,
which, if not so base as has been described
by writers of the Junius type, does
little credit to Scottish honour:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'Apart from any question about trust, had
the king really fled from enemies to find refuge
with friends? The Scots army were older and
steadier enemies than the English. It was in
the future, no doubt, that in England he was
to be put to death; but the Scots had no more
reason to expect this of the English than to be
themselves suspected of such a design; and it
was not by the party to whom he was intrusted
or "sold" by the Scots that he was put
to death, but by the enemies of that party.
The Scots had made up their minds to return
home when their arrears were paid. They
could not keep the king except by taking him
with them into Scotland, and such an act
would have implied at once suspicion and hostility
towards those who had been so long their
allies. The Scots showed in what they afterwards
attempted for him and his son, that, had
he agreed to their terms, and consented to be
a Presbyterian king over a Presbyterian people,
they would have fought for him instead
of "selling" him.'&mdash;(Vol. vii. 236.)</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span></p>

<p>It is unnecessary to dwell on the melancholy
scene of the execution of Charles I.
In his case, as in that of Mary Stuart, sufferings
and a violent death endured with dignity,
have atoned, in the eyes of many persons,
for misgovernment and political crimes.
This event was the signal for an open rupture
between the leaders of the various parties
which, in England and Scotland alike,
had accomplished the great revolution of the
time. The English Independents, already
supreme under Cromwell and his invincible
army, had resolved to establish the Commonwealth,
and to set up Puritanism as the national
faith; the Scots insisted on placing
Charles II. on the throne as a covenanting
King, and on Presbyterianism as the church
of these realms. A brief but decisive struggle
ensued, which, as might have been expected,
ended in the overthrow of the weaker country,
and the complete ascendancy of the
great soldier who had never yet met his equal
in the field. Mr. Burton describes at some
length the 'crowning mercies' of Dunbar
and Worcester, but we have no space to refer
to the narrative. In the settlement of the
religious affairs of Scotland, the breadth of
view and even the toleration of Cromwell
contrast favourably with the high-flown pretensions
and narrow-mindedness of the Presbyterian
clergy, who approved themselves the
Pharisees of pedantic formalism. His grand
exclamation&mdash;'In the bowels of Christ, I beseech
you think that you may be mistaken,'
shows that he recognised one of the principles
which in matters of faith enjoins charity.
We quote Mr. Burton's account of the
closing of the General Assembly:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'Lieutenant-Colonel Cotterel beset the
Church with some rattes of musketeers and a
troop of horse. Himself (after our fast, wherein
Mr. Dickson and Mr. Douglas had two gracious
sermons) entered the Assembly House, and immediately
after Mr. Dixon, the moderator, his
prayer, required audience, wherein he inquired
if we did sit there by the authority of the Parliament
of the commonwealth of England, or
of the commander-in-chief of the English forces,
or of the English judges in Scotland. The moderator
replied, that we were an ecclesiastical
synod, a spiritual Court of Jesus Christ, which
meddled not with any thing civil; that our authority
was from God, and established by the
laws of the land, yet standing unrepealed; that
by the Solemn League and Covenant the most
of the English army stood obliged to defend
our General Assembly. When some speeches
of this kind had passed, the lieutenant-colonel
told us his order was to dissolve us; whereupon
he commanded all of us to follow him, else
he would drag us out of the room.... Thus
our General Assembly, the glory and strength
of our Church upon earth, is by your soldiery
crushed and trod under foot, without the least
provocation from us at this time in word or
deed.'&mdash;(Vol. vii. 303.)
</p>
</div>

<p>It is, however, but just to add that Cromwell
did not countenance this violence; and
though the General Assembly was closed, no
restriction existed during his <i>r&eacute;gime</i> on the
exercise of the Presbyterian form of worship.</p>

<p>The northern and southern parts of our
island were now under the rule of Cromwell,
the Long Parliament having been swept
away, and the great soldier wholly supreme.
Even the worst enemies of the Protector
must allow that in Scotland, as elsewhere,
his government was in advance of his time,
and, if despotic, was wise and judicious.
After long conflicts, the nation was at rest;
and if its patriotic spirit was quelled, it enjoyed
a large share of real freedom, and grew
rapidly in material wealth. Though the
Kirk was no longer established, all forms of
Protestantism were tolerated and favoured;
and the Catholic nobles also had no cause
to complain of the harshness of the civil magistrate.
In governing the country Cromwell
gave proof of that profound policy and anticipation
of the future, which marks him
out as one of the greatest of statesmen. All
restraints on commerce were removed. Scotland
was completely united to England; the
feudal jurisdiction of the great nobles and
Highland chiefs was summarily abolished;
and forts, armed with sufficient garrisons, kept
the half-barbarous clans in subjection. In a
word, all the capital reforms which it took
a century after the Restoration to introduce
into Scotland again, were, in a few years,
carried out by Cromwell; and it is but the
truth that his Scottish policy was a model
for three generations of statesmen. Under
his far-sighted and firm government the
country began to thrive apace. We quote
from a contemporary chronicler this curious
account of Leith and Glasgow:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'The town of Leith is of itself a pretty,
small town, and fortified about; having a convenient
dry harbour, into which the Frith ebbs
and flows every tide, and a convenient quay on
the one side thereof, of a good length, for the
landing of goods. This place formerly, and
so at this time, is indeed a store-house, not
only for her own traders, but also for the merchants
of the City of Edinburgh, this being
the port thereof.... Glasgow, seated in
a pleasant and fruitful soil, and consisting of
four streets, handsomely built in form of a
cross, is one of the most considerable burghs
of Scotland, as well for the structure as trade
of it. The inhabitants, all but the students of
the college which is here, are traders and
dealers.'&mdash;(Vol. vii. 313.)
</p>
</div>

<p>Our space precludes us from dwelling at
length on the history of Scotland after the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
death of Cromwell, described fully by Mr.
Burton. As is well known, a loyal reaction
set in, in favour of Charles II., and this was
followed by a period of tyranny in Church
and State of extreme severity. Not only
were proscriptions frequent, and the scaffold
crowded with many victims, but the legislation
of 1641 was cancelled, Episcopacy was
insolently restored, the authority of the
Crown considerably increased, and Presbyterianism
barely allowed to maintain a weak
and inglorious existence. The era, indeed,
of the ascendancy of Sharp, and of the tender
mercies of Claverhouse and his dragoons,
was one of darkness and sorrow in Scotland&mdash;it
far exceeded in its melancholy features
that of the Cavalier reaction in England;
and the question arises why a nation, which
had proved itself so fiercely tenacious of its
independence in the preceding generation,
submitted for years to this cruel oppression.
Mr. Burton has hardly brought out sufficiently
the causes of this remarkable quiescence,
which are of deep interest to the student
of history. They are, we think, to be
found in the facts that, after the exertions
of the great civil war, Scotland was, in a
great degree, exhausted; that after the Restoration,
the power of the Crown was upheld
for the first time by a standing army,
not large, but formidable; and, above all,
that the Government avoided one capital
error of Charles I.&mdash;it conciliated instead of
injuring the nobles, and did not attempt to
assail their interests by threatening to resume
the old Church revenues. Worn out,
borne down, and without leaders, the nation
was for a time submissive; its discontent
exhibited itself in a few occasional risings
only; and Lauderdale, Charles II., and his
brother were allowed a season to fill up the
measure of iniquity and wrong. At last the
fierce awakening came. But it should be
observed that at this conjuncture the movement
for freedom began in England; and if
Scotland inaugurated the events which led
to the meeting of the Long Parliament, she
played a very subordinate part in the Revolution
of 1688. The passages of that memorable
time are not narrated in this work,
so it is not necessary to allude to them. An
estimate of Mr. Burton's history will be
gathered from what we have already written.
It is deficient as a picturesque narrative;
it sometimes, as may be supposed,
displays a too fervent national patriotism;
but it is singularly well-informed and complete,
and its conclusions on men and events
are usually careful, correct, and judicious.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="p2">'O Poesy divine! O sacred song!</p>
<p>To thee bright fame, and length of days belong:</p>
<p>Thou goddess, thou eternity canst give,</p>
<p>And bid secure the mortal hero live.'</p>
</div>

<p>Thus sings Nicholas Rowe in his translation
of the poet Lucan; but can we agree with
the sentiment expressed? It is partly true
and partly false, for although the poet possesses
this wonderful power, he himself
creates an enemy that wars against his own
and his hero's immortality, and this enemy
is the medium he uses to express his
thoughts. Few men will take the trouble
to learn a language for the special purpose
of enjoying an author's works, and therefore
for the many it is requisite that some one
should be ready and willing to reintroduce
the old writer into new society. The poet
Waller feared that the time would come
when his countrymen would be unable to
understand his writings, and he thus expressed
his fear&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'Poets that lasting marble seek,</p>
<p>Must carve in Latin or in Greek:</p>
<p>We write in sand, our language grows,</p>
<p>And like the tide our work o'erflows.'</p>
</div>

<p>This is, of course, an extreme view, and
time has proved it to be a false one; but
the writers of the centuries previous to
Waller are already in the position that he
expected soon to be in himself. Chaucer is
a household name, but we fear that few
read his works, and still fewer the works of
those who went before him. This is a state
of things that should not be allowed to exist;
but that it does exist, no one would be
rash enough to deny. We do not blame
those who neglect foreign literatures, but we
do blame those who turn away from the
authors of their own land because there is
some little difficulty in understanding their
writings.</p>

<p>It cannot be right that the literature of
England for eight or ten centuries should be
quietly ignored by Englishmen, because it
is not easy to read its language; and, moreover,
this difficulty is much exaggerated,
for although a Saxon book may, without
previous study, appear as if written in a
foreign tongue, yet the few difficulties of its
language will in a graduated study speedily
disappear. The pedigree is complete that
takes us back from the language of the nineteenth
to that of the fifth century. Both in
language and literature it is emphatically
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
true that the child is father of the man, and
no one can thoroughly appreciate the greatness
of Shakspeare, Milton, and our moderns,
who has not contrasted them with the
authors who preceded them; no one can
rightly judge the force of words and phrases,
who has not followed them up to their
sources, and seen the meads of thought
they have flowed through.</p>

<p>Not long ago the early history, language,
and literature of England were thought to
be unworthy of study. Men of culture
studied the languages and literatures of
France, Italy, Spain, and Germany, but
utterly neglected the early literature and
language of their own country, which were
considered rude and unworthy of attention.
We do not expect to find any among the
uneducated caring for the old forms of
speech, but it is a disappointment to find
men of education, who ought to be justly
proud of the grandest literature in the world,
treating our old writers with neglect. This
feeling of contempt for our early literature
is by no means yet destroyed, and therefore
no lover of the work done by his ancestors
should rest until it is entirely and for ever
eradicated.</p>

<p>In the old English literature there is a
choice for all tastes: history, biography,
theology, science, romance, lyrics, and merry
tales, have all come down to us from the
earliest times, and in them may be seen the
gradual development of the nation's mind.
It should be a cause of pride for the Englishman
to remember that the links in the
chain that connects the language of Tennyson
with the language of Alfred are all perfect.</p>

<p>Shall we, then, allow the treasures of the
past to crumble and decay? We are now
living in the enjoyment of an intellectual
feast that centuries of our forefathers have
prepared for us; and shall we in return
leave to our children less than we have ourselves
received? Are we not bound rather
to take no rest until all our MS. treasures
are placed beyond the reach of decay? The
printing press must not be allowed to pause
in its work until every line is set in type.
Nothing is more likely to encourage our desire
to attempt this great work than for us
to see what has been done of old. All honour
is due to the unnamed writer of the
Vernon MS.,<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> to Shirley and Thornton, the
contemporaries of Chaucer and Lyndesay,
who recognised the value of the treasures
that came in their way, and copied MS.
libraries that have survived in safety to our
times. The man who has consulted the
grand Vernon MS. in the Bodleian Library
has obtained a glimpse of the olden time,
with its noble desire to benefit posterity,
that he is never likely to forget.</p>

<p>The student, however, may naturally ask,
'Where can I study these works? I can't
read at Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh, or
London; and even if I could I don't understand
the writing. I want the books in
print, and not only in print, but in an accessible
form.' It is this question that we
will attempt to answer; this want that we
will try to show can be satisfied.</p>

<p>Various worthy men have at different
times laboured to diffuse a knowledge of
our old literature, and societies have been
formed for the same purpose. Hickes, Junius,
Gale, Lye, the two Elstobs, and many
others, are editors whose works have been
so widely circulated that we need hardly
dwell on them; but the issues of printing
clubs are less known, and we therefore propose
to summarize them. In 1812, the
Roxburghe Club was instituted in London,
to commemorate the grand sale of the Duke
of Roxburghe's library, and although many
trifling matters were printed by its members,
yet through its aid several important texts
have been brought to light. In 1818, John
Gower's 'French Ballads' and other poems
were printed; in 1819, Caxton's translation
of six books of 'Ovid's Metamorphoses,'
'Le Morte Arthure,' and 'Sir Lancelot du
Lake;' in 1828, 'Havelok the Dane;' in
1832, 'William and the Werwolf;' in 1838,
'The Owl and the Nightingale,' and Old
English versions of the 'Gesta Romanorum,'
and in later years the 'Alliterative Romance
of Alexander,' the 'Ayenbite of Inwyt,' and
the 'History of the Holy Graal.'</p>

<p>In 1823, the Bannatyne Club was started
at Edinburgh, and in 1827, it printed the
'Palice of Honor,' by Gawin Douglas, and
in 1839, a collection of all the poems relating
to Sir Gawayne, and Douglas's translation
of the '&AElig;neid of Virgil,' which it has
left without preface, glossary, or notes.</p>

<p>In 1828, the Maitland Club was founded
in Glasgow, and it printed three old romances,
viz.: 'Clariodus,' 'Sir Beves of
Hamptoun,' and 'Lancelot du Lak.'</p>

<p>The Abbotsford Club commenced its career
in 1835, at Edinburgh, and printed several romances
from the Auchinleck MS., as 'Rouland,'
and 'Vernagu,' and 'Otuel,' 'Arthour
and Merlin,' 'Sir Guy of Warwick,' and
'Rembrun,' and 'Sire Degarre.'</p>

<p>The Spalding Club, which was founded
in 1839, at Aberdeen, printed Barbour's
'Brus' in 1856.</p>

<p>Although the publications of these clubs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
are very praiseworthy, and have done much
good, the number of copies is so small, and
their commercial value so great, that they
are placed almost as far beyond the reach of
the ordinary literary man as the manuscripts
themselves. We believe that all true lovers
of their country's literature will echo the
words of a living editor quoted in the first
prospectus of the Early English Text Society.
'I should rejoice to see my books in the
hands of a hundred, where they are now on
the shelves of one.'</p>

<p>Soon after the select printing clubs were
started, a more popular movement set in, with
the foundation in 1834 at Durham of the excellent
Surtees Society. Although its publications
are mostly of an historical or local
character, it has issued several literary relics,
such as 'The Anglo-Saxon and Early English
Psalter,' 'Latin Hymns of the Anglo-Saxon
Church,' and 'The Lindisfarne and Rushworth

<p>Four years afterwards, the Camden Society
was started in London, and from 1838 to the
present time it has continued to publish a
most valuable collection of works. Its chief
object has been to advance historical studies,
but it has issued the 'Thornton Romances,'
comprising the early English romances of
Perceval, Isumbras, Eglamour, and Degravant;
three early English metrical romances&mdash;viz.,
'The Anturs (or Adventures) of
Arther at the Tarnewathelan, Sir Amadace,
the Avowynge of King Arther, Sir Gawan, Sir
Kaye, and Sir Bawdewyn of Bretan;' 'The
Ancren Riwle,' a treatise on the rules and
duties of monastic life; an 'Apology for
Lollard Doctrines' attributed to Wicliffe; and
Mr. Way's invaluable edition of the old
English and Latin Dictionary, entitled
'Promptorium Parvulorum.'</p>

<p>All students of English literature owe a debt
of gratitude to the Percy Society, which was
founded in 1840. Unfortunately it did not
meet with the success that it deserved, and
died a natural death after some unfortunate
dissension among its editors. Nevertheless,
it published in a convenient form, among
other works, 'Selections from the Minor
Poems of John Lydgate;' 'The Owl and the
Nightingale' from a better MS. than that
which the Roxburghe Club had printed;
'Reynard the Fox;' 'Poems of John
Audelay;' 'Romance of Syr Tryamoure;'
'Chaucer's Canterbury Tales,' from the oldest
and perhaps the best manuscript known;
'Songs and Carols of the fifteenth century;'
and William de Shoreham's 'Religious
Poems.'</p>

<p>In 1843, the Cheetham Society was formed
at Manchester, in order to print the historical
and literary remains connected with the palatine
counties of Lancaster and Chester; and
the &AElig;lfric Society in London, for the publication
of Anglo-Saxon works, both civil
and ecclesiastical.</p>

<p>The Caxton Society was started in 1845,
and the Warton Club in 1854.</p>

<p>The late Canon Shirley at one time projected
a Wycliffe Society, which was to
print our great reformer's works, but instead
he induced the Oxford delegates to undertake
the task, and after great labour he published,
in 1865, his catalogue of Wycliffe's
works. His lamented death has not stopped
the undertaking, and one volume of the Latin
works has been published at Oxford, and
three of the English ones are nearly ready
for issue.</p>

<p>In January, 1857, the Master of the Rolls
submitted to the Treasury a proposal for the
publication of materials for the history of
this country from the invasion of the Romans
to the reign of Henry VIII., which has resulted
in the issue of the valuable series of
chronicles and memorials of Great Britain
and Ireland during the middle ages. Many
of these works are in Latin and French,
but among those to be mentioned as written
in English are Capgrave's 'Chronicle,' Pecock's
'Repressor,' Cockayne's 'Saxon Leechdoms,'
the 'Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,' and
Wright's 'Political Poems and Songs.'</p>

<p>We have now scoured the field and shown
shortly what had been done before the formation
of the Early English Text Society.
This was but little, for there was a mass of
unprinted literature entirely unknown and
unregistered, and it was felt by a few lovers
of early English that the time had come
when the great work of producing this literature
in cheap editions must be grappled
with.</p>

<p>The Philological Society commenced in
1858 with the occasional publication of some
Old English MSS., and issued 'Early English
Poems and Lives of Saints,' 1250-1406;
'The Play of the Sacrament;' 'Liber Cure
Cocorum,' a cookery book in verse; Hampole's
'Pricke of Conscience;' and the 'Castel
off Love.' In 1864, these texts were
discontinued, and a few of the members of
the Philological Society 'formed a committee
for the purpose of collecting subscriptions,
and printing therewith early English
manuscripts.' From this small beginning the
Early English Text Society has grown to its
present flourishing condition, with a yearly
income of over &pound;900.</p>

<p>The publications of the Society are naturally
of a very varied character, but they may be
divided under four heads. There are first
the Arthurian and other romances; and
these form a large, and probably the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
popular class, for they were the light literature
of our ancestors, and in them we see as
in a mirror the love for war and women, and
for action of all kinds. Few of these are of
native growth, but are translations from the
French.</p>

<p>The second division consists of works illustrating
our dialects and the history of our
language, including a series of early English
dictionaries. Some of these last are of great
value and interest, and we are glad to see
that the Committee propose to edit some
which will form worthy companions to the
'Promptorium Parvulorum' of the Camden
Society. A rare old rhyming dictionary has
already been issued, and it is proposed to
bring out shortly the 'Catholicon Anglicum'
from Lord Monson's MS. This is a dictionary
of a slightly later date than the 'Promptorium,'
which contains many new and unregistered
words. To this second division
all the texts may be said to belong more or
less, because most of the editors give careful
glossaries and introductions on the dialect of
their authors. Dr. Morris's introductions, especially,
are the only real grammars of our
early language, and are of the greatest value
to the student of the history of the formation
of our tongue.</p>

<p>The third division consists of Biblical
translations and religious treatises; and the
fourth of texts, such as 'Piers Plowman,'
which do not come under either of the three
first headings.</p>

<p>We will now pass in review some of the
works issued by the Society, and we shall do
so according to their dates, beginning with
the 12th century.</p>

<p>The most valuable monuments of our language
are chiefly of a theological character,
and in 'Old English Homilies'<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Dr. Morris
has given us a deeply interesting collection,
from which a curious insight into the religious
views of the time may be obtained.
Much of the religious teaching of these old
preachers was of an evangelical character,
and is but little mixed up with the legends
of later writers. One writes: 'We must forsake
the broad way which leads to hell, and
choose the narrow and green way along the
high cliffs which leads to heaven, where
there are no earthly luxuries, but where the
sight of God alone constitutes the eternal life,
bliss, and rest of his saints.' In the homily
on the Lord's-day the author tells the curious
legend of St. Paul's and St. Michael's descent
into hell, and how they obtained for the
damned one day's rest in the week unto
doomsday. He admonishes all to honour
the Sunday, and fortifies his position thus:&mdash;'We
ought to honour Sunday very much,
and to observe it in all purity, for it hath in
it three worthy virtues which ye may hear.
The first virtue is that it on earth gives rest
to all earth-thralls, men and women, from
their thrall works. The second virtue is in
heaven, because the angels rest themselves
more than on any other day. The third virtue
is that the wretched souls in hell have rest
from their great torments.'</p>

<p>In the 'Story of Genesis and Exodus,'<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> the
author has versified the most important facts
contained in those books, and has included
portions of Numbers and Deuteronomy, so
as to give a complete history of the wanderings
of the Israelites, and the life of their
leader Moses. The poet (of whom nothing
is known) invokes the aid of the Deity in
these terms:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'Fader god of alle &eth;hinge,</p>
<p>Almightin louerd, hegest kinge,</p>
<p>&eth;u giue me seli timinge,</p>
<p>To thaunen &eth;is werdes biginninge,</p>

<p>Que&eth;er so hic rede or singe!'<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>
</div>

<p>He then goes on to relate, in a spirited
manner, the chief incidents of the Bible narrative.
Lamech's bigamy is thus referred
to:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'&eth;is Lamech was &eth;e firme<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> man</p>

</div>

<p>To bigamy is afterwards added murder:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'Twin-wifing and twin-manslagt,</p>
<p>Of his soule be&eth; mikel hagt.<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>'</p>
</div>

<p>The author thinks that Christian men
ought to be as glad as birds are of dawn, to
hear the story of man's bliss and sorrow.</p>

<p>'Seinte Marherete,'<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> is the first of a triad of
saints' lives, to be edited for the Society, the
other two (St. Juliane and St. Katherine) are
still to come. The editor is Mr. Cockayne,
whose observations are always worth a hearing,
although they are of a very pugnacious
character. In 'Hali Meidenhad,'<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> he expresses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
great offence at the opinions of his
author, whose attacks on wedlock he takes
very much to heart. We find in the side-notes
such expressions as these&mdash;'highflying
notions,' 'this ranter.' The anonymous author
of the treatise is supposed by Mr. Cockayne
to have been a bishop, and the same as
he who wrote the three saints' lives, and the
'Ancren Riwle.' Whoever he was, he writes
with considerable vigour, and describes the
troubles of wives with great goodwill. The
maiden is to ask the queens, rich countesses,
and saucy ladies as to their mode of life.
'Truly, truly, if they rightly bethink themselves
and acknowlege the truth, I shall have
them witnesses that they are licking honey
off thorns. They buy all the sweetness with
two proportions of bitter.' A husband is
held up before the maiden's eyes in these
unfavourable colours:&mdash;'While he is at
home, thy wide walls seem too narrow for
thee; his looking on thee makes thee aghast;
his loathesome voice and his rude grumbling
fill thee with horror. He chideth and jaweth
thee, and he insults thee shamefully; he
maketh mock at thee; he beateth thee and
mawleth thee as his bought thrall and patrimonial
slave. Thy bones ake, and thy flesh
smarteth, thy heart within thee swelleth of
sore rage, and thy face externally burneth
with vexation.' It shows how much outspoken
language has gone out of fashion,
that the author thinks it necessary to put
into Latin certain of the passages which a
bishop addressed to some young nuns. Mr.
Furnivall has unearthed from the Vernon MS.
a later essay on the same subject, entitled
'Clene Maydenhood,' in which the author
adjures young women to bind Christ in their
hearts, because man's love is never constant.</p>

<p>'Havelok the Dane,<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> is one of the best&mdash;if
not the very best&mdash;of early romances, and
we are indebted to the Society for bringing
it within the reach of the ordinary reader.
It was first edited, in 1828, by Sir Frederic
Madden, for the Roxburghe Club, but since
that time it has been almost unattainable on
account of its scarceness and consequent high
price. The story, like most of the romances,
is a version taken from an original, written
in French. Two kings, of England and
Denmark, die, and each leaves his child to
the care of a steward, who uses it badly.
Grim, the founder of Grimsby, saves the life
of Havelok, the son of the King of Denmark,
and comes with him to England, where
the boy grows up stalwart, and becomes the
strongest man alive, putting the stone twelve
feet beyond his companions. Havelok marries
Goldborough, 'the fairest woman alive,'
who was the daughter of the dead King of
England. The two go to Denmark and
drive the usurper from the throne, after
which they return to England, and conquer
the English usurper. They reign for sixty
years, and fifteen children are born to them,
who all become kings and queens. Havelok's
first acts, on his return to England,
were to found a priory of black monks in
Grimsby, for the good of his old friend
Grim's soul, and to marry Grim's daughters
to two of his courtiers. 'King Horn,'<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> another
romance of the thirteenth century, is
of English origin. Horn, the son of the
King of a place called Suddene, who had
been killed by the Saracens, reaches the
country of a neighbouring king with his companions,
and is loved by that king's daughter.
The king finds out the attachment, and
banishes Horn, who travels to another kingdom,
and conquers a formidable giant. After
this, he returns to Westernesse and claims
his lady love. Various troubles succeed;
but, in the end, Horn returns to take possession
of the ancestral throne of Sudden.</p>

<p>We now pass to the fourteenth-century
texts; and here we find the most important
work that the Society has attempted, which
is a three-text edition (under the able editorship
of Mr. Skeat) of the most valuable work
in early English literature before Chaucer,
viz., 'The Vision of Piers Plowman.'<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> This
great 'Puritan' poem was very popular for
many years, and a large number of MSS. of it
have come down to us. These differ very
much, and it appears that the author, William
Langland, was induced by the popularity of
this work to produce at various times what
may be called, for want of a better term,
three editions. These are represented by&mdash;1,
the Vernon MS.; 2, the copy printed by
Robert Crowley, in 1550; and 3, that printed
by Dr. Whitaker, in 1813; and all the
MSS. at present known can be ranged under
one or other of these types. Before commencing
the great work of producing a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
worthy edition of this great classic, the Society
was anxious to have as much information
concerning the MSS. as it could obtain,
and in 1866 issued Parallel Extracts of
twenty-nine MSS., asking, at the same time,
that librarians or possessors of libraries would
communicate to the Society's editor the discovery
of other MSS. not noticed in these
extracts, as the committee believed that many
valuable ones might have remained unknown.
In the following year Text A, from the Vernon
MS., appeared. This only extends to
eleven passus, or less than half of the whole
poem, as subsequently written. The author
is very severe upon the vices of his day, and
in scourging them he gives us a valuable insight
into the domestic life of the time.</p>

<p>The poem is divided into two parts, the
'Vision of Piers the Plowman,' and the
'Vision of Do-well, Do-bet, and Do-best.'
In the first, the author describes how he fell
asleep on the Malvern Hills, and saw, in a
dream, much to displease him. The world
is represented by a field full of folk, among
whom are ploughmen, spendthrifts, hermits,
minstrels, beggars, pilgrims, friars, a pardoner
with bulls, law-serjeants, bishops, and all
kinds of craftsmen. Holy Church comes to
the author as a lovely lady, and points out to
him Falsehood, Bribery, Simony, and Flattery.
The King makes up his mind to punish
Falsehood, if he can catch him; but that
delinquent flees, and takes refuge with the
friars, who pity him and take him under
their protection. The king then appeals to
Reason, but he will not take pity on wrong
until lords and ladies love truth, rioters are
holy clerks, knights are courteous, and priests
practise what they preach. The author
awakes, but soon dreams again. Conscience
preaches, and is seconded by Repentance in
his endeavours to convert the deadly sins.
The preaching has great effect, and all set
out on a pilgrimage to find Truth; but no
one knows the way, and a Palmer who has
returned from the Holy Sepulchre, and met
many saints, knows nothing of Truth. They
now meet Piers the Ploughman, who directs
them to the way, and promises to guide
them when he has ploughed his half-acre;
meantime he sets them to work. At first,
the people will not work till hunger comes
in, and then they agree to do whatever Piers
wills. All the names of persons introduced
into the poem tell their own story, thus Piers's
wife is called <i>Work when time is</i>, his daughter,
<i>Do as you are bid</i>, and his son, <i>Obey
your king</i>. In the second part, <i>Do-well</i> is
to fear God, <i>Do-bet</i> to suffer, <i>Do-best</i> to be
lowly of heart. All the allegory of the poem
is very palpable, and at times tedious; but
the incidental allusions to the state of the
people are of the greatest interest. The author
appears to have felt strongly the responsibility
of his position as a preacher, and
the contempt he evinces for the small value
of the Pope's pardon, shows us that in the
middle ages a purer Christianity was occasionally
preached than we are often apt to
imagine. Langland lays great stress on the
law of love, and shows the infinite superiority
of a life of righteousness over a mere trust
in indulgences. Mr. Skeat says of him: 'He
shows himself to us a man of simple, noble,
and pure faith, the friend of the poor, the
adviser of the rich, with strong views on the
duties of a king toward his subjects, together
with a feeling of deep reverence for the
kingly character, fearless, unprejudiced, and
ever willing to be taught.'</p>

<p>'Pierce the Ploughman's Crede'<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> is not
written by the same author as the 'Vision,'
but is an imitation of it by some one who
was glad to avail himself of the popularity of
that work. It is thus analyzed by Alexander
Pope:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'An ignorant plain man, having learned his
Paternoster and Ave Mary, wants to learn his
creed. He asks several religious men of the
several orders to teach it him. First, of a friar
Minor, who bids him beware of the Carmelites,
and assures him that they can teach him nothing,
describing their faults, &amp;c., but that the
friars Minor shall save him whether he learns
his creed or not. He goes next to the friars
Preachers, whose magnificent monastery he
describes; there he meets a fat friar, who declaims
against the Augustines. He is shocked
at his pride, and goes to the Augustines. They
rail at the Minorites. He goes to the Carmelites;
they abuse the Dominicans, but promise
him salvation without the creed for money. He
leaves them with indignation, and finds an
honest poor <i>Plowman</i> in the field, and tells him
how he was disappointed, by the four orders.
The ploughman answers with a long invective
against them.'
</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Skeat has followed manuscripts in his
edition which had been previously neglected.
Dr. Whitaker and Mr. Wright printed from
the first edition of 1553, but the British
Museum MS. is older than this, and there
can be little doubt that both the MSS. and
the printed copy are all copied from a MS.
now lost or not forthcoming.</p>

<p>The next work we shall mention is a translation
of a French treatise on sins and virtues
into the homely English of Kent. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
called the 'Ayenbite of Inwyt,'<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> two old and
expressive words which are now completely
lost to us, and superseded by remorse and
conscience. The book was written for the
benefit of laymen, in order that fathers and
mothers might keep their consciences undefiled.
There is a very full account of sins,
and the morality preached is very strict, for
backgammon and chess are placed among
foul and forbidden games. This text had
been previously edited by Mr. Stevenson for
the Roxburghe Club, but in a very careless
manner, as is seen by the author's original
preface and table of contents being left out.
Dr. Richard Morris has remedied these deficiencies,
and has prefixed a most valuable
grammatical introduction, in which the characteristics
of the Southern dialect during
the early English period (1250-1340) are
pointed out.</p>

<p>The late Mr. Toulmin Smith's collection
of the statutes of 'English Gilds,'<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> in the
14th and 15th centuries, is one of the most
valuable works issued by the Society, as its
interest is so wide as to include both the
past and the present. The study of the societies
of the olden times gives us a deep insight
into the domestic and municipal life
that has been so much neglected by historians,
and throws a strong light upon the
present condition of the working classes as
developed in the trades' unions.</p>

<p>A life and coherency has been put into
the dead bones of dry statutes by the valuable
essay on the subject by Dr. Lujo Brentano,
which is the first and only 'History of
Gilds' in English, and comprises the Continental
Gilds as well as our own. Mr. Toulmin
Smith unfortunately died before the
work was completed, but his daughter, with
filial piety, has worked at the completion of
her father's design, and the result is a book
that forms a worthy monument to an able
and good man.</p>

<p>The 'Early English Alliterative Poems'<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>
consist of the 'Pearl,' 'Cleanness,' and 'Patience.'
The first poem is an allegory of
great beauty, in which resignation to the
will of God is enforced. The writer has lost
a daughter of two years old, and he dreams
of gleaming rocks, crystal cliffs, and silver
trees, and sees his child in bliss on the opposite
side of a stream. The second poem is
a collection of Biblical stories tending to enforce
purity of life, and the third is a paraphrase
of the Book of Jonah. All three
show the author to have possessed much
poetic power.</p>

<p>'William and the Werwolf'<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> was edited
by Sir Frederic Madden, in 1832, for the
Roxburghe Club, but his edition had become
very scarce before the Early English Text
Society undertook its publication as the first
text for their Extra Series. Mr. Skeat, who
has edited this edition, has wisely changed
the name of the English romance to William
of Palerne, because it is a translation of the
French 'Guillaume de Palerne,' and has been
able to fill up the missing parts of the English
version from the French MS., portions of
which were supplied to him by M. Michelant,
of the Imperial Library at Paris. The
story is as follows:&mdash;William, the son of the
King of Apulia, is about to be murdered by
his uncle, when he is carried off by a wolf,
who is found subsequently to be a werwolf
or manwolf, enchanted by his stepmother.
William is adopted by a cowherd, and afterwards
taken into his household by the Emperor
of Rome, whose daughter falls in love
with the boy. To save herself from being
married to another prince, Melior leaves the
palace with William, both of them being disguised
as bears. They are taken care of by
the werwolf, and afterwards re-disguise
themselves as a hart and hind. William
performs marvels, taking the werwolf's step-mother
a prisoner, and only releasing her on
condition that the werwolf shall be disenchanted.
All ends happily, with several
marriages as a climax.</p>

<p>We have not yet referred to the great
cycle of Arthurian romances, which have
lately been brought so prominently before
the reading public by the charming poems
of the Poet Laureate. Most of these romances
were introduced to an English public
in the 15th century, but some are of an earlier
date. 'Sir Gawayne and the Green
Knight'<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> is one of these last, and appears
to have been written by the author of the
'Alliterative Poems' previously mentioned.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
Sir Gawayne, the matchless and faultless son
of Loth, was one of the leading spirits in his
uncle's court, and the present text contains
one of the most interesting incidents in his
career. While Arthur is holding a Christmas
festival at Camelot, a knight of gigantic
stature, clothed entirely in green and riding
on a green foal, enters the hall. He carries
an axe, sharp as a razor, and asks that some
one should strike him with it, on condition
that he may return the stroke at the end of
a year. All are silent. Arthur accepts the
challenge, but Gawayne beseeches his uncle
to allow him to undertake the encounter, and
the king consents. The Green Knight adjusts
himself, and after Gawayne has struck
off his head, walks off with it under his arm.
The company feel more comfortable after
his departure, but the year soon comes to an
end, when Gawayne must travel to seek the
Knight of the Green Chapel. After many
adventures, Gawayne comes to the loveliest
castle ever beheld, where he is welcomed
warmly. The lord (who is the Green Knight
in a more ordinary costume than that he had
before adopted) treats him nobly, and tells him
that he will direct him to the Green Chapel.
The two make a covenant between them that
the lord shall go to the chase and Gawayne
stay at home, and at the end of the day give
each other what they have got in the meantime.
On the first day the hostess tempts
Gawayne, but he is proof against her charms,
and she leaves him with a kiss, which he
gives the host at night; on the second day
she does the same and gives him two kisses,
which he gives to his host; the third time
Gawayne is again tempted and receives
three kisses, and a girdle of green lace that
will preserve whoever wears it from wound
or death. At night Gawayne gives the
kisses but keeps the girdle. On the morrow,
after much trouble, he finds the Green
Chapel, from which the Green Knight comes
out, and makes a feint to strike him. The
Knight pretends to strike again, and the
third time he brings blood, when he explains
his conduct to Gawayne thus:&mdash;'Two blows
I aimed at thee, for twice thou kissedst my
fair wife, but I struck thee not, because thou
restoredest them to me according to agreement.
At the third time thou failedst, and
therefore I have given thee that tap.' The
Green Knight, who is Bernlak de Hautdesert,
now tells Gawayne that his aunt, Morgain la
Fay, lives at his castle, and presses his friend
to return with him, but Gawayne will not, as
he wishes to return to Arthur's court. Here
he is received with joy, and all the knights
wear a green belt in his honour. The author
tells all this, which we have been obliged to
relate in the baldest manner, with great
spirit and vivacity; and in the midst of his
story he gives lively accounts of boar and fox
hunts, which display a wonderful mastery
over language. Another of the prominent
knights of Arthur's court was Lancelot of the
Laik.<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> His adventures are related in a short
romance paraphrased into the Scottish dialect
from a part of the long French 'Lancelot.'
The author is in love and dares not
tell it, but dreams that he should write a
poem for his lady love to read. He does
not know what to write about until he thinks
of the romance of 'Lancelot,' when he runs
over rapidly an enumeration of that knight's
early deeds by way of saying that he will
not tell of them. He then commences in
earnest with the wars between Arthur and
Galiot. A knight brings a message from
King Galiot, bidding Arthur to yield to him
or he will invade his land and not return
until he has conquered and taken Queen
Guinevere prisoner. Arthur returns the defiance,
but on asking Gawayne who Galiot is,
he learns that ten kings obey him. At this
time Lancelot is imprisoned by the lady of
Melyhalt, and laments his fate, but as he
hears of a battle between Arthur and Galiot,
he obtains leave from the lady to join Arthur
on condition that he returns to his prison at
night. The lady provides him with a red
courser, and red shield and spear, and he
goes to the fight, where he performs wonders,
and sees the queen, with whom he
falls in love. He returns to prison, where
the lady visits him, and is smitten with love.
She goes to court, and returns after being
sumptuously entertained. She now promises
to let Lancelot go on one of three conditions&mdash;either
he must tell whom he loves, or declare
his name, or say if he expects again to
equal his former exploits. He refuses to
tell his lady's name, or his own, but declares
his trust to do more than he has done before.</p>

<p>The lady of Melyhalt asks Lancelot to remain
with her till the next battle, when she
will provide him with black armour. Arthur's
forces are led in the fight by Gawayne,
who is severely wounded. Lancelot joins in
the battle on the third day, and laments
over Gawayne, but he does not waste time
in regrets; for on all the ladies, with the exception
of the queen, sending him a message,
he overthrows several knights, and does great
damage to the enemy. At last, on Gawayne's
instigation, the queen sends him a
message, the receipt of which affects him so
much that he seems to grow a foot in height,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
and nothing can withstand him, as he goes
into the thick of the fight. His foes leave
the place in mortal fear at the sight of
him; for whilst his thoughts are of his lady's
love he achieves unheard-of-wonders. At
last he is borne to the earth, and Galiot, who
has seen his powers, says he shall not die on
his account, and gives him his horse. Here
the Scottish romance closes, and the rest of
the story is only to be learnt from the French
original. Gawayne swoons when he sees
Lancelot with Galiot; but the latter is induced
by Lancelot, although he is conquering,
to submit to Arthur. When all are friends,
Galiot and Arthur go to see the wounded
Gawayne, and then they speak of Lancelot.
Gawayne says that he would wish to be a
woman, if Lancelot would love him all his
life. The queen seems to approve of the
sentiment, for she admits that she can say no
more. Now the serious part of the story
commences, for the queen, through the instrumentality
of Galiot, visits Lancelot, and
promises to love him. She takes counsel
with the lady of Melyhalt, and after a general
understanding they all part, with hopes
of soon meeting again.</p>

<p>Mr. Furnivall has printed a short and rapid
sketch of the life and wars of <i>Arthur</i>,<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>
king of men, which occurs in an incomplete
Latin 'Chronicle of the Kings of Britain,'
belonging to the Marquis of Bath. The author
seems to have got excited, and found
dull Latin prose unequal to his feelings, so
he breaks out into English verse. There are
many spirited and lively sketches in the Lincoln
'Morte Arthure,'<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> which was first printed
by Mr. Halliwell, in 1847. It opens
with a general statement of Arthur's conquests,
and then proceeds with the account
of the summons from the Emperor Lucius.
When Arthur hears it, his face is so terrible
that the Romans who bring the letter quail
before him. The king has a magnificent
feast prepared, at which boars' heads are
served upon silver, and peacocks and plovers
upon golden plates. There are also sucking
pigs, herons in sauce, huge swans, cranes, and
curlews, tarts and conserves, hams and brawn
in slices, wild geese and ducks, young hawks,
stews, curries, and all kinds of made dishes.
So much for the food; and the drinks are on
as grand a scale of magnificence. Wine of
various kinds is made to run in silver conduits,
and the rare sorts are served by the
chief butler in goblets of gold, decked with
precious stones, in order to preserve the
drinkers from the deadly effects of poison.
All this grandeur astonishes the Roman senator,
who allows that Rome itself could show
nothing equal to this luxurious feast. Arthur
sends a grand message to the Roman emperor,
in which he threatens to throw down
the walls of Milan, ravage Tuscany, and besiege
Rome. All these big words seem to
have frightened the Roman senator, for he
prays to be protected on his homeward
journey; and Arthur tells him that if his
coffers were crammed full of silver, he would
be quite safe with a passport from him.
Nevertheless, the Romans were glad to get
away, and</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'Of alle &thorn;e glee undire Gode so glade ware &thorn;ey nevere,</p>
<p>As of &thorn;e sounde of &thorn;e see and Sandwyche belles.'</p>
</div>

<p>In the great battle that follows, Lucius's
army is preceded by sixty giants, born of
fiends and witches, riding on tower-bearing
camels. In spite of all this, Arthur is victorious,
and sends the body of the emperor,
whom Lancelot had killed, to Rome, as his
arrears of tribute. Other battles<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> succeed
this, till Arthur learns of the villany of his
bastard son, Mordred, when he at once sets
out for Britain, and he might well say with
Edgar&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices</p>
<p>Make instruments to plague us.'</p>
</div>

<p>Gawayne, always rash, fights Mordred like a
madman, and is slain in the deadly struggle.
Thus dies the merriest, the kindliest, and
the bravest of knights&mdash;he who was the
hardiest of hand, the happiest in arms, and
the most polished in hall. Now all grows
dark, and the end begins to close upon all.
Arthur finds the dead body of his nephew,
and his great grief is beautifully exhibited in
the following description:&mdash;</p>

<p>Arthur now, with his 1,800 men, fights desperately
against 60,000, and is successful in
conquering them, and killing Mordred; but
what signifies victory, when he has got his
death wound, his wife has deserted him, and
his friends are dead around him. The
great conqueror and pattern of all knightly
virtues dies a broken-hearted man, and the
grand old story comes to an end. The writer
really felt what he was writing about, and the
consequence is, that his history stirs our very
blood. And not in vigour alone is the writer's
power shown; the lines in which he
describes a bright morning in spring, and
others in which he tells of love, can hardly
be beaten by any other early work.</p>

<p>'Merlin'<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> is one of the longest of the romances,
and although the whole of the text
has been issued in three parts, the work still
awaits for its completion Mr. Wheatley's introduction,
index, and glossary. It has,
however, two interesting essays prefixed&mdash;one
by Mr. D. W. Nash, who learnedly
draws the distinction between Merlin the enchanter
and Merlin the bard; and another
by Mr. J. S. Stuart Glennie, on the Arthurian
localities which he finds in Scotland.
The story commences with the miraculous
birth of Merlin, and a description of King
Vortiger's tower. The various events occur
very rapidly at first. Pendragon and Uter defeat
Vortiger, and Pendragon becomes king,
but soon after he is killed in a battle, and Uter
succeeds him, taking his brother's name at
the same time as a surname. Uter Pendragon
falls in love with Ygerne, the wife of the
Duke of Tintagel, and by the help of Merlin
he deceives her into receiving him as her
husband while the duke is away. This ill-used
man is killed in a fight, and the king at
once marries Ygerne, who soon after bears
him Arthur. Merlin is now very busy, and
by his help the child is carried away. When
Uter Pendragon dies, Merlin points Arthur
out as the heir. He is made king, but the
barons revolt against him, and now a long
series of battles commence, which are
graphically described by the old author.
Gawein and the other nephews of Arthur
come to him to be knighted, and through
their instrumentality the rebel kings are
gradually reconciled to their chief, to whom
they do homage.</p>

<p>Merlin is enchanted by Nimiane, in a hawthorn
bush, in the forest of Brochelond, and
Arthur is heavy at heart on account of the
long absence of his adviser. Gawein and
his fellows go to seek for Merlin, and with the
account of their adventures the book is
brought to an end.</p>

<p>The 'Romance of the Chevelere Assigne'<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
is a translation of the French poem, 'Chevalier
au Signe,' and was formerly edited for
the Roxburghe Club by Mr. Utterson. The
present editor, Mr. Henry Hucks Gibbs,
gives in his preface a description of a curious
ivory casket of 14th century workmanship,
belonging to Mr. William Gibbs, which illustrates
the story.</p>

<p>King Oryens and his queen Beatrice have
no child to succeed them, and when one day
they see a woman with twins, the queen is
unkind enough to revile her. As a punishment,
she herself soon afterwards bears six
sons and one daughter, each with a silver
chain about its neck. The king's mother,
Matabryne, gets a man to drown the children,
which she replaces by seven whelps, and then
bids the king to burn his wife. Marcus, the
man employed to take away the children,
leaves them in a wood, wrapped up in a
blanket, a hind then suckles them, and a hermit
takes them home. The forester sees
them, and tells Matabryne, who has the eyes
of Marcus put out, and employs Malkedras to
kill the children, and take away their chains.
The man only finds six, as one is with the
hermit; but he smites the chains from off
these, and the children are turned into swans.
The queen gives the chains to a goldsmith to
make into a cup, but one chain increases so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
that half of it does for a cup, and the workman
keeps the other five. The poor queen is
to be burnt for her crime of bringing forth
seven whelps, and a day is fixed for the purpose;
but in the meantime, an angel comes
to the hermit, and tells him the whole truth,
commanding him at the same time to take
the child he has with him to court, and have
him christened Enyas. The angel counsels
the child, who is twelve years old, to say that
he will fight for the queen. There is then a
great combat, in which right is victorious.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'Alle &thorn;e belles of &thorn;e close rongen at ones,</p>
<p>Witheoute ny mannes helpe while &thorn;e fyghte lasted.'</p>
</div>

<p>Enyas cuts off the head of Malkedras, and
the old queen is burnt instead of the young
one, who is unbound. The goldsmith comes
forward with the five chains, which being
given to the swans, bring them back to their
proper form. The unfortunate sixth one,
however, is obliged to remain a swan because
its chain is irrevocably gone.</p>

<p>The 'Book of the Knight of La Tour Landry'<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
is a very entertaining work, as it gives
us a good insight into the condition of woman
in the fourteenth century, which cannot
be considered as at all satisfactory. The worthy
knight set about instructing his three
daughters on their various duties, and all his
directions are enforced by some tale from the
Bible or monkish legends. He employed
two clerks and two priests to look up examples
and anecdotes for him, and a curious
medley is the result of their labours. He
seems to have been a credulous man, and a
good friend to the priests, for he never fails
to uphold their views. He tells us that the
Virgin saved the life of an evil woman when
she fell into a well, because she fasted on
Fridays and Saturdays, and kept herself from
sin on those days; but a good woman was
lost because she did not confess one sin. He
is very severe upon the dressiness of the women,
and says that young ladies <i>now</i> often
take so long to adorn themselves that they
are too late for service. Some ladies who
washed their hair in wine and other things,
to change its colour, could not get into the
church of our Lady until they had cut off
their hair. Besides waste of valuable time,
much money was thrown away by these ladies,
and the knight laments that one woman's
dress would have clothed many poor.
The worthy man wrote a book for the benefit
of his sons, on the same plan as this one
for his daughters; but, unfortunately, it has
been lost.</p>

<p>'The Wright's Chaste Wife'<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> is really,
as it is here styled, 'a merry tale.' A wright
or carpenter marries a fair maiden, whose mother
can only give, as her portion, a garland
of roses, that will keep its colour while she is
true to her husband, but will change if she is
faithless. The man makes a room in his
house, with a trap-door, out of which escape
is impossible, and then goes to build a hall for
a certain lord. This lord asks the wright
about his garland, and thinks he will go to try
its efficacy. He gives the wife forty marks,
and she tells him to go to the secret chamber,
where he drops through the trap-door. He
threatens, but his passion is of no avail; and
when he is hungry, the woman will give him
nothing to eat until he has earned his dinner
by work. The steward follows the lord, and
gives the woman twenty marks, when he also
is sent upstairs, and tumbles through the trap-door.
This man won't work until he is very
hungry. Next comes the proctor, who also
gives the woman twenty marks, and likewise
tumbles through the hole prepared for his reception.
He very much objects to work, and
stands out for a longer time than the others;
but at last he is obliged to give in too, and
spin for his meal. At last the wright comes
home, and wonders at the noise. When he
finds out the cause, he asks his wife to let the
lord out, but she will not until his lady is
sent for. At last all three are set free, and
the garland remains as fresh as ever.</p>

<p>This story is a reproduction and improvement
of one of the 'Gesta Romanorum,' in
which the carpenter gets with his wife a shirt
that will never want washing as long as she

three lovers are fed on bread and water, and
not made to work, as in Adam de Cobsam's

<p>Mr. Furnivall seems to have a special gift
for hunting interesting tales and bringing
them to earth. His 'Political, Religious,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
and Love Poems'<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> are a miscellany of good
things of various dates; but the 'Babees
Book'<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> is a perfect treasure-house of curiosities,
which tend to illustrate the manners of
the fifteenth century. It contains a 'lytyl
reporte' of how young people should behave;
'how the good wijf tauzte hir douztir;'
'how the wise man tauzt his son;' the
'Book of Nurture, or schoole of good maners
for men, servants, and children,' by Hugh
Rhodes; the 'Boke of Nurture, by John
Russell;' the 'Boke of Kerninge;' the
'Booke of Demeanor, and the allowance
and disallowance of certaine misdemeanors
in companie, by Richard West;' the 'Boke
of Curtasye;' the 'Schoole of Vertue, by F.
Seager,' and various other pieces on the customs
of the times. The authors of these
pieces give very good rules for behaviour,
and some of them would be appropriate in a
book of etiquette of the present day; but
others discover a state of society now happily
passed away. The subjects treated of
rise from the rules laid down for boys, which
if they follow,</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'Than men wylle say therafter</p>
<p>That a gentylleman was here,'</p>
</div>

<p>up to the difficulties that beset chamberlains,
ushers, and marshals, in ordering the precedence
of the great men entertained by their
lords.</p>

<p>Mr. Furnivall has prefixed to his book a
valuable introduction on the subject of Education
in Early England.</p>

<p>'The Booke of Quinte Essence'<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> is a
short text with a long title, on a revelation
delivered to Hermes, the prophet and king
of Egypt. It is here said that God's greatest
secret for man's need is how to restore
old feeble men to the strength of youth. A
walnut-shell full of the wonderful liquid is
sufficient to turn an old man young again, to
cure one given up by the doctors, and to
make a coward bold and strong. Besides
all these advantages, it has the further one
of driving away the devil. As the price of
the book that contains these wonderful secrets
is only one shilling, we should not be
surprised to learn that the Society had sold
a very large number of copies.</p>

<p>We now pass to some of the purely religious
texts of the fifteenth century, commencing
with the hermit of Hampole.</p>

<p>Richard Rolle, author of the 'Prick of Conscience,'
was formerly held in great estimation
as a prolific writer, and his 'English
Prose Treatises'<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> are a real addition to our
literature. The hermit was not a priest, but
a recognised, although an irregular sort of
preacher. One John de Dalton gave him a
hermit's clothing and a cell, and provided
for his maintenance. His gaze was ever upwards,
and he was so absorbed in his work
that his friends could take off his tattered
coat and put it on again when mended without
his knowledge. He was an ascetic himself,
but saw that some men must lead an
active life or the world would come to an
end; and although much of his teaching is
gloomy, it is generally Scriptural. Hampole
died of the Black Death, in the year 1349,
and his shrine became a favourite resort of
pilgrims, who believed that he performed
miracles of healing after his death. Mr.
Perry has discovered a very great curiosity
in a Latin office, prepared for the time when
the hermit should be sainted. Whether this
time did arrive, or whether the office was
actually used, does not appear.</p>

<p>The 'Religious Pieces in Prose and
Verse'<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> contain Dan Jon Gaytryge's sermon,
'the whilke teches how scrifte es to
be made, and whareof and in scrifte how
many things solde be consideride' (this has
also been wrongly attributed to Wiclif); the
'Mirror of St. Edmund,' which contains
some good precepts, although gloomy and
ascetic; the 'Abbey of the Holy Ghost,' and
a few hymns and poems. The 'Abbey of
the Holy Ghost' is founded in the conscience,
and the maidens that cleanse the
place are righteousness and purity. The
abbey is built on the river of tears, meekness
and poverty prepare the ground, the walls
are raised by obedience and mercy, the love
of God and right faith are the cement.
Patience and faith shall raise the pillars,
shrift make the chapter-house, preaching the
hall, prayer the chapel, contemplation the
dormitory, sadness the infirmary, devotion
the cellar, and meditation the store-house.
The Holy Ghost is the warden and visitor,
charity the lady abbess, wisdom the prioress,
meekness the sub-prioress, discretion the
treasure, orison the chauntress, jubilation
the helper of the chauntress, devotion the
cellaress, penance the cook, temperance the
waiter, soberness the reader, pity the answerer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
mercy the almoner, dread the porteress,
honesty the mistress of the novices,
courtesy and simplicity the receivers of the
guests, and reason the purveyor. But with
all these excellent virtues about, four evil
damsels are introduced into the abbey, and
they are envy, pride, grumbling, and evil-thinking,
who do much mischief; but in
answer to prayer the visitor expels the evil
damsels.</p>

<p>John Myrc, a canon of Lilleshall, in
Shropshire, knowing how ignorant many
priests were, compiled his 'Instructions for
Parish Priests,'<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> for the purpose of 'coaching'
them in their duties. He instructs
them as to the questions they should ask the
penitent in confession, and gives forms of
absolution. He says that bad Latin does
not spoil the Sacrament, if the first syllable
of each word be right. The author, however,
does not confine himself to priests, but
adjures the laity to be reverent in their behaviour
at church; and not to jest or loll
against pillars and walls. This treatise affords,
as may be supposed from its subject,
very valuable illustrations for the life of its
time.</p>

<p>We have left to the last, one of the texts
that we like best, and that is, the 'Hymns
to the Virgin and Christ.'<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> These poems
are full of a pure devotional feeling, and
many of them exhibit their authors as true
poets. 'The Mirror of the Periods of Man's
Life; or, Bids of the Virtues and Vices for
the Soul of Man,' is a striking and vigorous
poem; but there is a tender philosophy
breathing throughout 'Revertere' (in English
tunge, turne aghen!) which is very
charming:&mdash;</p>

<p>Besides the texts we have noticed, there
are many of a later date than the fifteenth
century; but we cannot do more than mention
the names of Lauder's 'Poems,' Hume's
'Orthographie of the Britan Tongue,' Thynne's
'Animadversions of Chaucer,' Lyndesay's
'Works,' 'The Romance of Partenay or
Lusignen,' Levins's 'Manipulus Vocabulorum,'
Awdeley's 'Fraternitye of Vacabondes,'
&amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>The list of books to be printed in the future
is a very tempting one, and we notice
many works of great interest, which we
trust the Society will have money enough at
its disposal to allow it to issue. This can be
done only by a large accession of members,
and we are sorry to see that the income has
not increased as it ought to have done during
the last year. The following are the totals
of the balance-sheets of the various years
from the formation of the Society in 1864,
when the income was only &pound;152 2s.; 1865,
&pound;384 0<i>s</i>. 11<i>d</i>.; 1866, &pound;681 0<i>s</i>. 1<i>d</i>.; 1867,
&pound;941 6<i>s</i>. 10<i>d</i>.; 1868, &pound;1,229 1<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>.; 1869,
&pound;1,227 19<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.</p>

<p>The committee seem to feel the greatness
of the work before them, and calling for
further assistance, write in their fourth report:&mdash;'Thus
reinforced, the Society can
proceed with fresh vigour to the accomplishment
of its task, with the determination not
to rest till Englishmen shall be able to say
of their early literature, what the Germans
can now say with pride of theirs, "Every
word of it is printed, every word of it is
glossed."' And in their second report, they
had previously said, 'The Society will be
ready to take on itself the burden laid by
the late J. M. Kemble on the &AElig;lfric Society,
to leave no word of Anglo-Saxon unprinted.'
In redemption of the latter pledge
it has now in the press, King Alfred's translation
of Gregory's 'Pastoral Care,' the
'Homilies of 971 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>,' belonging to the
Marquis of Lothian, and a fresh set of
&AElig;lfric's 'Homilies,' most of which are in
verse.

<p>We ought never to lose sight of the
urgent need there is for printing our MS.
treasures. A unique manuscript may be
destroyed at any moment, as has lately occurred
in the total destruction of the Strasburg
library, to the irreparable loss of the
whole literary world.</p>

<p>All tastes are catered for in the set of
Early English Texts. Do you wish for ballads
and short poems? You have them
here. Do you care only to read romances?
You have the tales of battles and gallantry
that delighted our grandfathers while they
sat as open-mouthed listeners to the reading
of the great volume that lasted them for
many a long winter evening. Do you wish
to study manners and customs, to find out
how our ancestors lived, worked, and played,
what were their religious beliefs and superstitions?
Here are ample materials for your
investigation. Or is the old language the
object of your examination? Then the
great object of the Society is to popularize
the old works that illustrate the history of
our native speech.</p>

<p>There is everywhere evidence of a growing
living interest in modern languages, and
of an attempt to study them with the
thoroughness that has heretofore been confined
to the classical languages. At present,
although we are comparatively in the dark
as to our grammatical forms, we are gradually
constructing a history; but we cannot
build without bricks, and the Early English
Text Society proposes to supply them.</p>

<p>No pleasure is thoroughly enjoyed until
it is imparted to another, so that as we have
had the satisfaction of conversing with, and
studying the mind and manners of our ancestors,
we are anxious that others should
enjoy the same pleasure; and we cannot but
feel that those who will only read printed
books are under great obligations to those
gentlemen who undertake the arduous task
of reading and explaining the manuscripts
for their amusement and instruction. We
have made a rapid sketch of the literature
of several centuries as illustrated by the publications
of the Society, and necessarily,
from the extent of the subject, in a very
slight and cursory manner, but we shall be
quite satisfied if its imperfections lead our
readers to consult the originals themselves.</p>

<p>We may add, for the benefit of those
whom it may interest, that the subscription
to the Early English Text Society is one
guinea a year (with an additional guinea for
those who subscribe to the Extra Series),
and the honorary secretary is Mr. Henry B.
Wheatley, 53 Berners-street, W.</p>

<p class="p2">The glory of the Episcopal Church, according
to many of her loudest eulogists, is
her comprehensiveness. She is not, they
say, like the sects, bound within the narrow
lines of a rigid orthodoxy. She does not
expect that from all her pulpits the same
doctrines should be preached in stereotyped
phraseology, not even that her ritual shall
always conform to the same pattern. She
recognises diversities of tastes, and adapts
herself to them. Instead of checking, she
encourages the widest freedom of inquiry,
and secures for her clergy a liberty which
the members of voluntary communities will
not tolerate in their ministers. Hence she
includes in her ranks men of innumerable
varieties of opinion, from believers in the
extreme theory of verbal inspiration on the
one hand to Doctor Colenso and his sympathizers
on the other; from upholders of
sacramentarian and sacerdotal systems, which
run to the very verge of Romanism, to men
whose Church principles are hardly to be
distinguished from those of the Plymouth
Brethren. Whether such diversity is consistent
with the fundamental principles of
the constitution of the National Church;
whether it was ever contemplated by the
men who, at the time of the Restoration,
gave her her present character; whether the
advocates of this comprehensiveness support
it by arguments drawn from their own ideal
of what a National Church should be, rather
than from the documents which determine
what the Anglican Church really is; whether
the principle they lay down is worked out to
the extent which, if admitted at all, justice
would demand; whether, on the whole, it
works for evil or for good, are questions
which we do not propose to discuss at length
here. The fact at all events is patent, and
was never more so than at present, that the
Church of England includes not only individuals
of different views, but great antagonistic
parties having their separate organizations,
pursuing their own ends, and two of
them at least, so far from admitting that the
Church should be of this comprehensive
character, asserting that they themselves are
the only loyal Churchmen, and that all
others have more or less of the taint of
heresy upon them. The lines of demarcation
have become even wider, and the feelings
cherished by the more eager partizans
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
on either side more intense than when,
eighteen years ago, one of the distinguished
divines of the day gave to the world his
celebrated sketch of the rival hosts. During
the interval there have been many fierce
struggles, in the settlement of which the
courts of law have been called to intervene.
Decisions of great importance in their
bearing upon the liberty enjoyed by the
clergy have been given. Toleration has
been secured for doctrines and practices
which it was generally thought were inadmissible,
and the legislature has gone so far
in its desire to relieve scrupulous consciences
as to modify the terms of clerical subscription.
The result of the liberty thus given,
has been, as perhaps might have been expected,
a wider divergence of opinion than
has existed at any previous period; but this,
unfortunately, has not been accompanied by
a growth of that mutual tolerance which
even the result of the various suits, instituted
for the suppression of what was regarded
on one side or the other as heresy,
ought to have produced. The parties who
have failed in their attempts to purge the
Church of error have sat down under their
defeat, angry and discontented, the loud talk
of a determination to secede rather than be
parties to the toleration of false doctrines
has died away, but the lesson as to the limitation
of their power has done nothing towards
producing a spirit of greater charity.</p>

<p>The Broad Church party&mdash;if indeed it is
right to speak of a number of men who have
no party organization and no party aims,
among whom are to be found all shades of opinion,
and whose one bond of connection is
their common love of freedom&mdash;have consistently
maintained that the Church of England
belongs neither to one section nor the
other, but is intended to comprehend all.
The aim of the courts has been as far as possible
to maintain this view, on behalf of
which they have often strained the language
of the law to a dangerous extent, and in fact
have allowed mere custom to set aside the authority
of law in a way which certainly would
not have been tolerated in any proceedings
relative to property or civil right. The expositions
of ecclesiastical law, as given even by
the highest court, have often been remarkable
as illustrations of the dexterity with
which the judges have rescued the Church
from positions of great difficulty, rather than
as examples of sound interpretation of the
statutes. Considerations of public policy
have affected the decisions, and the strict letter
of the law has been disregarded in a
fashion which would find little favour in
Westminster Hall. The question has been,
not as to the positive requirements of the
statute if construed on the ordinary principles
of language, but as to the amount of latitude
to be permitted; and so far has this
been carried, that the defendant in a recent
suit was bold enough to quote a passage
from a letter of Dr. Arnold, which was not
published till after his death, as illustrative of
the liberty which had been granted to him,
and which, therefore, though to a much greater
extent, he demanded for himself. Statesmen
and lawyers in truth, understanding that
the absolute victory of either of the contending
parties meant the downfall of the National
Church, have anxiously sought to protect
all in the enjoyment of their position,
and to make them understand that the continuance
of the great institution, to which in
common they profess so hearty an attachment,
depends upon their mutual recognition
of each other's rights. But the lesson has
been given to reluctant pupils, of whom it
would not be too much to say that they cling
to that which they ought to forget, and turn
a deaf ear to all they need to learn. If
among the best men on all sides there has
been the steady growth of a better feeling,
and if there is an increasing body of the
ablest and most thoughtful of the clergy who
refuse to identify themselves with any party,
the majority of the strong adherents both of
the High Church and the Evangelicals display
all the old spirit, and if they had the
power certainly do not lack the will to make
the Church the exclusive preserve of their
own section.</p>

<p>A better illustration of this could not well
be found than that which is given in the introductory
Essay on 'Anglican Principles' in
the recent volume of 'Essays on the Church
and the Age,' the manifesto of moderate
High Churchmen. In this party the Dean of
Chichester deservedly holds a very high place.
His great abilities, his large and varied experience,
his distinguished services in various
departments of labour, his high character,
rightly give him position and influence. He
is not a man of illiberal temper, and if he
ever had the heat of the partizan, the mellowing
influence of time has toned down its
ardour. He is so far from being a man of
extreme views or from cherishing any sympathy
with the Ritualist party, that he says,
'They assert dogmas which are scarcely to
be distinguished from some of the errors of
the Church of Rome.' 'To this party,' he
adds, 'those who adhere to the principles of
the English Reformers, and who were, till of
late years, known on that account as High
Churchmen, are as much opposed as they
have ever been to the Puritans, and on the
same grounds.' His opposition to these Romanizing
tendencies, however, does not lead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
him to regard more favourably those who are
at the other pole of the theological compass.
On the contrary, if he condemns Ritualists,
he lays much of the blame for their position,
as well as for that of the Rationalizers, on
the Evangelicals, whom he charges with infidelity
to their ecclesiastical obligations, and
with all the consequences which have resulted
from those lax notions of subscription of
which they gave the first example. 'The
only difference,' he says, 'between the Tractarian
and the Puritan, in regard to the formularies
of our Church, is this, that the former
honestly, if not discreetly, has avowed
the principle upon which the other party has,
from the time of the Reformation, never
ceased to act. The Puritans did not use the
term non-natural; but what else is meant
when they clothe in the garment of Calvinism
what the Church has laid before them as
plain and simple Catholic truth?' Having
himself no sympathy with those who do not
care to inquire what the Church really means
in the dogmas which she has laid down, and
who are satisfied if they can so torture her
formularies as to make them lend an apparent
sanction to preconceived opinions, he
contends that 'if the thumb-screw be allowable
to one party, it cannot be withheld from
the other;' ... that if liberty be
granted to one, it must be extended quite as
freely to the other; and that if this be conceded,
the only conclusion is that 'we possess
no authoritative statement of doctrine
whatever.'... 'The question is&mdash;we
repeat it&mdash;the principle having been conceded
to the Puritans, where is it to stop!'
This is certainly turning the tables to some
purpose. The Evangelicals have been in the
habit of denouncing, with a good deal of
righteous indignation, the Popish traitors
who eat the bread of a Protestant Church,
while all the time they are labouring only to
betray her into the hands of her enemy; or
the still greater offenders who continue to occupy
Christian pulpits, while their writings
show that they have accepted even the fundamental
doctrines of Christianity in a non-natural
sense. It is somewhat startling for
them to be told, not only that they are equally
guilty, but that their own laxity has been
the fruitful parent of the excesses of which
they complain so bitterly in others; that as
the definite meaning of formularies must be
maintained or universal liberty be conceded,
and every man left to believe as seemeth
right in his own eyes, the toleration to a Gorham
necessitated toleration to a Bennett and
a Mackonochie and a Colenso; and that on
them, therefore, rests the responsibility for
the disorder, the anarchy, and the heresy by
which the Church is afflicted. The argument
is not new, for it is substantially that which
was employed by the Rev. W. G. Ward in
his defence before the Oxford Convocation,
and the Evangelicals would doubtless have a
good deal to say in opposition to its conclusions.
We quote it here only as indicative
of the strong feelings that prevail between
different parties. Mr. Ward used it in self-defence,
and in an extremity when the <i>tu
quoque</i> plea was about the only one which
was available. From Dr. Hook it comes as a
judicial utterance; and when such a man
adopts this style of criticism, we can easily
understand with what bitterness the struggle
will be carried on by those who have neither
his ability nor his self-restraint.</p>

<p>While High Churchmen are thus determined
on their side, and while the more advanced
section of the party never attempt to
conceal the contempt they entertain for
Evangelicals, we have only to turn to the utterances
on the opposite side to see how fully
the sentiment is reciprocated. It would
be hard to conceive of a sadder caricature of
Christianity than would be presented by a
series of extracts from the <i>Church Times</i> and
<i>Church Review</i> on the one side, and the <i>Record</i>
and the <i>Rock</i> on the other. That there
are members of both parties who are shocked
by the violence, the narrow-mindedness,
the unreasoning partizanship of their organs,
we do not doubt; but it is impossible to deny
that these journals do represent large classes,
whose antagonism to each other they at once
stimulate and express. The scenes which two
or three years ago disgraced the meeting of
the Christian Knowledge Society, and the
prosecutions which occupy so much of the
time, and must sometimes try the temper and
patience of the judges, are other indications
of the same virulence of spirit. We hear
about the comprehensiveness of the Church,
but while this internal strife continues, that
comprehensiveness is its scandal, not its glory.
It is the legal association in a Christian
Church of men who have no faith in each
other, whose principles are mutually subversive,
who lose no opportunity of expressing
their disgust with their companions and their
belief that they are where they are, only by
unfaithfulness to conscience and disobedience
to law. It is the maintenance of an outward
and visible form of union where there is not
the inward and spiritual grace; not the fellowship
of those who have subordinated minor
differences that they may cultivate a true
spiritual unity, but of those whose antagonism
is deep-rooted and intense, and who remain
in the same Church from mutual jealousy
and distrust rather than from any better
feeling. It is a comprehensiveness which
is the child of legal moderation, not of Christian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
charity, which, so far from being the legitimate
development of noble and generous
sentiment, is the result only of external constraint,
whose hollowness is evident in the
railing accusations to which both parties condescend,
and which survives only because neither
is willing to withdraw from an enforced
and hateful union, and so leave all the prestige
and emoluments of the National Church
in the hands of its opponents for the promotion
of what it regards as deadly error.</p>

<p>The ideal of a church which allows the
greatest latitude of opinion consistent with
an adherence to the primary truths of the
Gospel, which trusts for the maintenance of
Christian truth to its own living force rather
than to any artificial defences, which aims to
cultivate unity of spirit rather than agreement
in creed, which, proceeding on the belief that
where there is the same spirit there will yet
be diversities of gifts, and under the same law
differences of administration, does not attempt
to curb the free development of individual
belief or allow the divergence to
which it may lead to interfere with the enjoyment
of true spiritual fellowship, is a very
exalted one. If the Church of England were
really striving to attain that, or if it exhibited
any signs of an approach to it, we should
be prepared to condone many faults, and,
even though it failed to realize its own conception,
to honour it for aiming at such an
ideal. But this is just the view which High
Church and Low Church would alike repudiate.
Little love as they bear to each other,
they have still less for the only section which
is honestly seeking to give the Church this
character. Whether or not the members of
the Broad Church party are right in their interpretation
of the facts of history or the
principles of ecclesiastical law, it is due to
them, at least, to say that they are consistent
in their maintenance of clerical liberty.
Others demand freedom for themselves, and
are very loud in their protests against ecclesiastical
despotism if there is any danger that
they may themselves become its victims.
Broad Churchmen vindicate the liberties of
all, and have more than once, in times
of fierce excitement, exposed themselves to
a storm of unpopularity by their gallant
defence of men who had made themselves
obnoxious by their avowal of what was
branded as heresy. All others have in their
turn been assailants; they, never. From all
the crusades against heresy they have stood
aloof, and have been content to bear the reproach
of heterodoxy themselves rather than
do anything which might narrow the boundaries
of the Church, or curtail the freedom of
the clergy. We could not find a better illustration
of this than in Dean Stanley's recent
volume of Essays. We find him in the Gorham
controversy breaking a lance in defence
of the Evangelicals when an attempt was
made to deprive them of their status in the
Church; and when they, forgetful of their
own difficulties, turned round, and in their
turn became assailants of the authors of
'Essays and Reviews,' we find him equally
resolute in courageously withstanding them.
His own views in opposition to Ritualism
are expressed with sufficient distinctness, and,
when dealing with its favourite South African
prelate and his attack on Dr. Colenso, he is
bold and unsparing; but if any wish him to
unite in an effort to expel Ritualists from the
Church, his answer is, 'As we would wish to
include the Nonconforming members of the
Church who are without its pale, so we
would wish to retain those Nonconforming
members who are within its pale.' The very
thoroughness with which the Dean carries
out his principle itself irritates many. They
cannot understand how a man should be so
zealous a champion of the rights of those
whose theological and ecclesiastical opinions
he has not a spark of sympathy. But nothing
tempts him to swerve from his position.
The Church is nothing to him if she be not
comprehensive, and he will resist to the
death anything which threatens to deprive
him of this boasting on her behalf.</p>

<p>All that Broad Churchmen can thus do,
however, is to justify themselves. They cannot
alter the fact that there is an Act of
Uniformity defining exactly what the character
and constitution of the Church shall be;
and when we come to examine the history
and requirements of that Act, it is difficult
to see how it can be maintained that the
Church was intended to be comprehensive.
It is so in fact; but it is so certainly in opposition
to the designs of the ecclesiastics of
the Restoration who gave it its present constitution,
and in opposition to the letter of
the law.</p>

<p>But if the existence of separate parties
with views in such complete antagonism as
to be mutually destructive is an anomaly,
these parties may plead in their own behalf
that they are as necessary to the Establishment
as the Establishment is to them; that
they could exist and work for the advancement
of their own views even though they
should be expelled from the Establishment,
but that in such case it must assuredly fall;
and that so conscious of this have been the
administrators of the law, that until the
extreme views of Mr. Purchas and Mr. Voysey
have dictated a somewhat different
course, their constant effort has been to avoid
any decision which might compel any one of
them to secede&mdash;a tenderness certainly not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
prompted by any regard to them, but solely
by a consideration of the probable results to
the Establishment. How far this should reconcile
conscientious men to retain their position,
is a point which must be left for themselves
to settle. Nonconformists have sometimes
been too ready to settle it for them,
and condemn both Evangelicals and Ritualists
for infidelity to truth because they do
not take the course which, under like circumstances,
they themselves would feel
bound to adopt. Imputations of this kind
are as impolitic as they are unfair. They
leave out of sight the different aspect in
which the same facts present themselves to
different minds, and the diversity of conclusion
which may be reached with perfect honesty
on all sides. It is certain, however
strange it may seem to those looking at the
subject from a different stand-point, that of
the two extreme parties there are numbers
who sincerely believe that the Church was
intended to be of their particular type&mdash;'Evangelical
or Catholic,' as the case may be.
It requires a good deal of faith, perhaps, to
believe that any man can honestly think that
Gunning or Sheldon intended to make the
Church Evangelical, but it is nevertheless
certain that numbers have a sincere conviction
that Evangelicals are the true Churchmen.
That 'Catholics' on their side are satisfied
of their own ecclesiastical orthodoxy is less
surprising; while any, whether High Churchmen
or Low Churchmen, who are candid
enough to confess their rubrical transgressions,
would maintain that no one conforms
to the pattern in all things, and that if they
err, it is only in common with all beside.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable features in
the history of the Church during the last
twenty years has been the development of
High Church principles; and in this we do
not so much refer to the extreme extent to
which they have been pushed by the Ritualists,
or to the increase of professed adherents
of the party, as to the higher tone of Church
sentiment which is so perceptible, and which
has affected numbers who would disown all
connection with any section of the party.
The Tractarian movement has undoubtedly
been one of the chief causes of this. Mr. Bennett
and others of the early leaders who still
remain faithful in their allegiance to the
Church of their birth, may well congratulate
themselves on the different atmosphere by
which they now find themselves surrounded.
They have not indeed succeeded in moulding
public opinion, they have not undermined
the strong Protestant feeling of the nation
nor have they persuaded the people that the
National Church is anything but a Protestant
Church. But practices are tolerated to-day
which formerly were regarded with horror
and alarm; battle-grounds which once were
hotly contested have been left in possession
of the High-Anglicans, and they, grown bold
by the successes they have won, have put
forth new claims and are seeking to introduce
innovations&mdash;or, as they would call
them, restorations&mdash;which the most sanguine
among them would not have dared to contemplate
a few years ago. To preach in a
surplice, for example, is no longer regarded
as an evidence of Romanising tendency, although,
perhaps, it is still a sign that the
preacher is not of the Evangelical party. In
the struggle, however, which is now waged
to prevent the adoption of sacrificial vestments,
it is almost forgotten how recently
the appearance of the preacher in a surplice
was sufficient to provoke popular commotion
and to furnish an occasion of legal prosecutions.
In the style of Church architecture
and music, in the more elaborate form of
service adopted in places innocent of High
Church tendencies, and in the increased attention
paid to some of the festivals, we find
the same advance. Nor is it only in such
points as these that the change is seen.
Even more significant is the quiet revival of
Convocation, and the amount of influence
it has been able to gain. Power in the
strict sense of the term it has not; and
there is often a ludicrous contrast between
the loudness of its talk and the feebleness of
its performances. But if it has no legislative
authority, it continually passes its judgment
on questions affecting the interests of the
Church, and its pretensions have sometimes
been treated with a consideration, not to say
deference, which is indicative of an alteration
in the spirit of the times. No English
Prime Minister, indeed, whatever might be
his personal proclivities, would dare to concede
what its leaders consider themselves
entitled to ask; yet a careful observer cannot
fail to see that it has been quietly asserting
itself in a way most grateful to the advocates
of ecclesiastical ascendancy. The
Bill for the Revision of the Lectionary, introduced
in the last session of Parliament,
afforded a very striking proof of this advance.
Convocation was first consulted as to the
changes proposed to be made, and greatly to
the satisfaction of High Churchmen, the
preamble of the measure contained a distinct
reference to the opinion which that
august body had expressed on the subject.
It is true that the Bill did not pass the
House of Commons, and would probably
not have been able to secure the assent of an
assembly chosen by household suffrage without
the sacrifice of this point of the preamble,
but the fact that it was introduced by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
the ministers of the Crown and, in opposition
to the protests of Lord Shaftesbury and
some other peers, was accepted by the House
of Lords, is itself painfully significant. It
may even prove that the move has been premature
and impolitic, and the result may be
the awakening of a spirit of jealousy that will
prevent any further encroachments. Still,
such progress as has been made in this development
of Church authority would not have
been possible if there had not been, in certain
quarters, a state of feeling friendly to it&mdash;a
reaction against the Erastianism which would
treat the clergy as mere officers of the State,
whose duty was simply to carry out the will
of Parliament&mdash;a growing tendency to accept
the rule of the Church in the business of the
Church.</p>

<p>There are many who attribute this High
Church development to the influence of what
they call the 'Catholic revival' throughout
Europe. A wave of deeper spiritual feeling,
more humble reverence for authority, more
perfect faith in Catholic truth, and more
earnest desire to work out the true Catholic
ideal of holiness has, they say, been passing
over the Continent, and it has reached us.
Before we admit the fact of this revival, we
are entitled to ask where its evidences are to
be found. Is it in Belgium, esteemed the
most Catholic country in Europe except Ireland,
where the closer our acquaintance with
the people the more clearly does it appear
that underlying much show of outward devotion,
there is, especially in the male part
of the urban population, a spirit of silent
but decided revolt against the superstitions
of Rome? Or is it in Austria, whose ecclesiastical
policy has been growingly liberal in
its character, and has been continually putting
it more and more out of accord with the
Vatican? Or in Spain, where once priests
and Jesuits ruled supreme, but where the
fall of their wretched instrument, who so
long disgraced the throne of that unhappy
land, has inaugurated an era of freedom?
Or is it in Italy herself, preserving indeed her
outward allegiance to the Papal See, but it
is to be feared with little faith of any kind
surviving among her people? As we look at
these nations where the dominion of Rome
is supposed to be most secure, it seems absurd
to talk of 'Catholic revival.' Still we
cannot say that it is only a dream of enthusiasts.
In a certain sense there has been the
revival of which Archbishop Manning is so
fond of boasting. Ages and countries in
which we find great material prosperity, love
of luxury, a low standard of morals, are those
in which we find also a strong development
of superstition, and a readiness to bow to the
will of the priest. Europe in the nineteenth
century is no exception to the rule. France
in particular would perhaps be pointed out
as the scene of the great Catholic revival of
the day; and if the desertion by the great
body of the Gallican bishops and clergy of
the cause for which their predecessors so
gallantly contended, the readiness of priests
and people to accept the most extreme views
of Papal infallibility and Mariolatry, the restoration
of the rites of the Church in the old
cathedrals in their full pomp and circumstance,
and the shameless subserviency of
French politicians to Papal ambition, be the
signs of a 'Catholic revival,' such revival
there undoubtedly has been. Side by side
with the falsehood, the frivolity, the idle display,
the incredible extravagance, and the
immorality which were the scandal of Paris,
and in which the court of the Second Empire
was so deeply implicated, there was also
an outburst of superstitious devotion, yclept,
we suppose, a 'revival.' The Empress was
the great leader of fashion, and as she was a
devotee of Rome and the Jesuits, it became
fashionable in the circles of which she was
the centre, to affect an earnest zeal for the
Church and her observances. As in Paris,
so to some extent in other capitals; and
thus, though there is little on which a Church
intent only on spiritual ends could congratulate
herself, there have been an increased
splendour in ceremonial, a more facile acceptance
of Church dogmas, a greater show
of deference to the priest, and especially to
the Holy Father, which have been gratefully
welcomed. Looking back at the position of
the Papacy in 1848, and tracing its rise from
the extreme depression into which it had fallen
at that time, to that sense of power which
encouraged the Pope eighteen months ago to
convene a Council in the hope that it would
realise the grand idea of years, and proclaim
his infallibility, we cannot be surprised that
we hear boasts of a revival. But the more
closely it is examined, the less of a religious
character will it be found to possess.</p>

<p>In England it has been different. Whatever
we may think of the doctrines of the
Tractarians, it would be worse than uncharitable
to doubt their sincerity, their conscientiousness,
their intense devotion to the
principles they hold, their spiritual life and
fervour, as it would be foolish to deny that
they have been the authors of what may fairly
be described as a 'Romish revival.' So
far as there has been any real religious movement
in the Roman Catholic churches of the
Continent, we believe that it has come from
this country. It was no small thing for the
Papal See to gain the distinguished band of
converts, of which Newman and Manning
are the most conspicuous. Bringing with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
them subtle and highly-cultured intellects,
high reputations, and fervid zeal, they threw
themselves into the service of the Church in
which they professed to have found rest with
all the passionate devotion of new converts,
and their influence could not but be felt
throughout the whole Romish community.
The prospect of the return of England to the
true Church that so large a secession from
the Anglican ranks seemed to hold out, was
itself sufficiently stimulating, while the example
of their ardour and diligence stirred up
their new associates to nobler efforts in the
common cause.</p>

<p>But while they thus breathed new life
into the movements of the Roman Catholic
Church, their influence did not end there.
The leaven of their teaching and spirit remained
in the Church they had forsaken.
Contrary to what was once expected, their
secession neither deterred many of their
sympathisers from venturing still further in
the dangerous paths which had conducted
their leaders to Rome, nor induced them to
follow their example, and reconcile themselves
with the Holy See. So far from the
Church being purged of Tractarian principles,
these are more defiant and rampant
than ever. Mr. Bennett, Dr. Littledale, and
Mr. Mackonochie have only developed the
idea of Mr. Newman and his coadjutors; but
they have done this to an extent which their
predecessors never attempted, and which
in those days they would not have thought
possible. It is possible now, because these
teachings have done much more than merely
indoctrinate a certain number of minds with
their opinions, they have created a High
Church tone in a much wider circle than
that which they are able directly to affect.
Men who would scorn to accept them as
their leaders, who declaim about the absurdity
of some of their practices, and the Romish
tendency of the whole movement, are
yet to an extent, perhaps almost unconsciously,
influenced by them. How is this?</p>

<p>Something is due to their very audacity.
They speak with no faltering tone, they act
with decision and fearlessness, and the confidence
which they show in themselves and
their opinions begets a similar feeling in
others; while even with those who refuse
to yield themselves absolutely to their lead,
there is a disposition to think that, though
they may push their notions too far, they
would not have dared to go to such an extreme
unless they had been in the main
right. There are large numbers of Englishmen,
who, looking on at the spectacles provided
for them in Ritualistic churches, are
induced, after the first feeling of surprise,
and possibly of indignation, is over, to say,
'There must be something in these men;
they have gone too far, but that is only
what others are doing in the opposite direction.
They have borrowed too much
from Rome, while others approach too near
Geneva. We like neither the one nor the
other. What we want is the service of our
own Church well done.' Thus they have
carried a large body who condemn Ritualism
to a position in advance even of the old
High Church view, and they have done it
mainly because they had the courage of conviction,
and did not shrink from the consequences
to which their boldness might expose
them. What the Protestant public
would think and say of them, how many
prejudices they would awaken, what condemnation
they would have to face, they
must have foreseen. But they have braved
all, and they have a reward, even beyond
the progress they have made in winning
converts to their party, in the subtle but
powerful influence they have exerted on
Church sentiment.</p>

<p>They have had, too, the life and energy
characteristic of the youth of religious
parties. In the abundance of their labours,
in their freedom from conventionalism
in their work, in their willingness to
adopt any plan which has been found successful
by others, they are an example to
ministers of all churches. There are, of
course, among them those who have little
sympathy with the noble aims of their
brethren, and who have no higher object
than a gratification of their own strong
priestly instincts, perhaps even of their
childish love of display, who delight in the
show of the gorgeous service, and have little
care for the truths it is intended to symbolize,
and who bring contempt upon the whole
movement by words and deeds which stamp
on it a character of weakness and puerility.
It is the fate of every party to attract some
followers of this type, and it would be as
unfair to judge it by them, as it would be
uncandid not to recognise the higher qualities
of those who have given it weight and
importance. The truth is, these men have
a faith, and they are not afraid of avowing
and of acting upon it; and in an age which
is only too prone to seek after compromises,
this itself gives them power. Their very
dogmatism, offensive as it is to inquiring
minds, is a reaction from the too prevalent
laxity of religious belief, and commends
them to a large class who are weary of endless
disputations, and crave for something
positive. To the clamour for liberty&mdash;which
is not unfrequently only another name for
lawlessness, the sign of an unwillingness to
submit to any rule either of faith or practice,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
the assertion of a man's right to believe what
he likes, and do what he will&mdash;they oppose
the law of a Catholic Church, ending all discussion,
and silencing opposition by the mere
assertion that the Church has spoken, and
that through her we receive the will of God.
In the presence of a widespread disbelief in
the supernatural, and a desire to eliminate
the miraculous from the teachings of Scripture,
they assert the existence of a perpetual
miracle in the presence of the Lord upon
His own altars, and find the best evidence
of His Incarnation in the extensions
of that incarnation through the sacraments
for the nourishment of the spiritual life of
His followers. Such a creed is out of harmony
with all Protestant opinion, and does
not bear the test of either reason or Scripture;
and when, as it must be, the demand
for its acceptance is based on the authority
of the Church, it is open to attack from the
Roman Catholic side equally fatal with that
which it has to encounter from Protestantism.
But illogical and unscriptural as it
appears to us, it is held by Anglicans with a
tenacity, and worked out with an enthusiastic
ardour, of which we find too few examples
among the believers in creeds of a
more Scriptural order. They are ready to
proclaim its articles on the housetops; so
far from attempting to hide the extravagance
of any of their pretensions, they seem
rather to delight in bringing them out in
their most pronounced obnoxious forms;
and by their outspoken boldness they constrain
even the admiration of those who
like them least.</p>

<p>If this party have gained power by the
strong assertion of their distinctive principles,
they have largely increased it by the
way in which they have identified themselves
with various popular movements, and
the earnestness, combined with a certain
kind of practical wisdom, with which they
have prosecuted their work. With all the
deference they claim for tradition in relation
to doctrine, they show not the slightest
respect to traditional notions, so far as
Christian work is concerned. Of that regard
to dignity which restrained the High
Church clergy of a former time from everything
that bore the most distant resemblance
to Methodism, they have not a vestige, and,
indeed, they view it as one of the errors of
that dreary Hanoverian Protestantism which
they hate intensely, and certainly not without
good reason. They set out with an ardent
longing to recover the masses of the people
to their allegiance to the Church, and any
means that will contribute to that end they
adopt. 'All other sections of the English
Church save one,' Dr. Littledale tells us,
'have stood their trial and have failed.' The
time is come when an effort should be made
on a different principle, and that principle is
a careful regard to the tastes and necessities
of the people whom they have to win; for
past failure is to be attributed largely to 'a
refusal to face the fact, that it is with beings
with human wants and frailties, and not pure
disembodied rationalities that the Church
has to deal, that the shopkeepers and artisans
have gone to Dissent, and the labourers
have gone to the devil.' Acting on this
conviction, they have sought to understand
the nature of the influences by which the
people have been drawn on both sides in
order that they might fight both dissent and
the devil with their own weapons. They
have been willing to learn everywhere,
believing that if the children of this world
are in their generation wiser than the children
of light, the latter cannot do better
than become pupils in their school. Hence
they have not been particular as to who their
instructors were, if only they had something
to teach them, and have been content to
learn from a gin-palace as well as from a
conventicle, from the Odd-Fellow or Forester
as well as from the Primitive Methodist, borrowing
from the one the histrionic style of
their Ritual, and from the other the spiritual
enthusiasm which expresses itself in revival
services with stirring addresses and glowing
hymns. There is certainly something singular
in the idea that, inasmuch as the landlord
of the gin-palace caters for his customers by
means of painting, light, and music, the
Church of Christ should do the same, and
that ministers of the Gospel, adopting the
arts of the managers of benefit societies,
and pandering to that childish love of display
which the latter gratify by glittering
insignia of office, processions with a great
deal of pomp and show, and rites around
which a mysterious awe is thrown, should
seek to attract the people by churches with
gaily decorated altars, processions with banners
and music, and a regular succession of
church festivals celebrated with accessories
that appeal to both the eye and ear. It indicates,
however, the spirit of the party.
Their Ritual has a deeper meaning than this,
but by many it has undoubtedly been developed
with the prominence they have given
it under the belief that it would produce
great popular effects.</p>

<p>Had they, however, confined themselves
to the cultivation of this histrionic element,
they would never have gained the power
they possess. They have been equally active
in the employment of means of a higher
order. With the contempt for preaching
which was, and still is, so prevalent amongst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
a large number of the Anglican clergy, they
have little sympathy; for while they attach
supreme importance to the work of the
sacrificing priest or the confessor, they take
ample care also to cultivate the art of popular
address. This was specially apparent in
the celebrated 'twelve days' mission,' which
brought into notice more than one public
orator of a type very different from anything
with which the Episcopal Church has
been familiar. That mission itself, disfigured
as it was by many extravagancies and eccentricities,
lowered in its character as a Christian
work by the loud flourish of trumpets
by which it was heralded, and the jubilant
exultation as to its success in which its
promoters indulged, and especially discredited
by their manifest design to make it an
opportunity of familiarising the minds of
the people with Romish notions and practices,
was, nevertheless, a remarkable proof of
the skill as well as enthusiasm of the party.
We should be sorry to think that among
those by whom it was carried on there were
not many influenced by a higher desire than
to secure a mere party triumph; but regarded
in that light only, we cannot too much
admire the knowledge of human nature, and
particularly of English human nature, shown
by those who conceived the idea. Its very
novelty was sure to arrest attention and draw
crowds, and the fact that crowds are drawn
by whatever means to religious services is
with many sufficient to cover a multitude of
offences against good taste, and even against
Christian truth. There are those who apply
to everything what they call practical tests,
and one of their surest tests of the power
of a preacher, is his capability of attracting
large audiences. Of course, the proclamation
of a grand crusade against sin and
Satan, to be undertaken by a number of
clergymen whose peculiarities had already
attracted to them a large share of public attention,
awakened curiosity, and, if there
had been no other feeling, that would have
been sufficient to crowd the churches.
Among those who attended these services
were many good people who went to see in
what fashion and with what weapons this
new warfare would be carried on. They
saw the unusual sight of numbers, and many
of them belonging to classes seldom found
in a place of worship, coming night after
night, and apparently impressed by the
services. They heard eloquent preachers
preaching to them the great truths of the
Gospel, in forcible and striking language
rebuking the sins of the day, in vivid and
glowing pictures setting before them the
love of Christ and His redeeming work, and
in thrilling appeals beseeching them to believe
and obey. Though even this could
not reconcile them to a style of worship so
strongly Romish in its character, or lead
them to accept the error which was so subtly
insinuated, it disarmed not a few prejudices,
and led numbers, who never had a friendly
thought towards Ritualism or Ritualists before,
to think that, despite all their faults,
these men were doing a great work, and
were not lightly to be evil spoken of. The
spectacle of so many clergymen banding
themselves together for earnest evangelistic
work, casting aside the traditions of their
Church and their office, throwing themselves
heart and soul into services in which the
freedom and fervour, characteristic of
Methodist revivals were substituted for the
dulness and decorum with which the high
Anglicans of former days were satisfied, and
determined that, so far as lay in their
power, they would make their Church what
it has so often claimed to be, and what as a
National Church it ought to be, the Church
of the people, could not fail to produce a
deep and favourable impression. Men who
maintain an attitude of indifference to all
parties did homage to the earnestness which
marked the movement; and even among
those who regarded it with strongest disapproval,
and believed that its effect, so far as
it was successful, would be to Romanize
rather than Christianize the people, there
were many who felt that the only way of
overcoming such workers would be to display
a spirit as devoted, as self-denying, and
as practical as their own. Ritualists would
be mistaken if they accepted the ungrudging
praise which was given in many quarters to
their daring courage, their free and energetic
modes of action, their conscientious attempts
to solve in their own fashion one of the
most important problems of the day as indicating
any abatement of decided opposition
to their teachings, or of the righteous indignation
with which those who are most ready
to honour them for all that is good in them
or their work, view their disloyalty to the
Church of which they are ministers, and the
wretched quibbles by which they seek to
cloak or excuse their unfaithfulness. But,
on the other hand, the Evangelicals will be
equally mistaken if they forget that practical
service of this character tells powerfully
on behalf of the party by whom it is undertaken,
and that those who feel that duty
compels them to take a position of antagonism
to it must, if they are to carry popular
sympathy with them, justify their faith also
by works.</p>

<p>Another feature in the conduct of the
Ritualist clergy deserving of commendation,
is the tact they have shown in utilising the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
power which was lying dormant in their
congregations. The experience of all
Churches testifies that nothing does more to
attract a man to a religious community than
the assigning to him a place and a work,
and so making him feel that he contributes
something to its power and prosperity. The
'Catholic' party (as they would have us call
them) understand this, and have acted upon
it. They endeavour to find a place for
every one who will heartily give himself to
the common work. They take care, of
course, to preserve the sanctity and authority
of the priesthood, and have clearly-marked
boundary lines beyond which no layman will
be allowed to go; but they perceive that
one grand secret of the weakness of the
Episcopal Church has been the unwillingness
or the inability of the clergy to use the
services which numbers in their congregations
were willing to render, and they have
sought to remedy the defect. Let it be
granted that much of the work they give to
their followers is not of a very exalted or
edifying character. Still, even the masters
of ceremonies, the cross-bearers, the choristers,
the acolytes, the sacristans, feel themselves
honored by the kindly notice of the
clergy. They are pleased to think themselves
of some use and importance, are led
to identify themselves with the movement,
and are often among its most zealous propagandists.
The Christian work of women
has been made a special study, and a number
of devoted labourers called forth, who are
among the most trusty adherents of the
party, and whose ministry of love has been
an immense gain to the influence of the
Church in the neglected districts where it is
carried on, and is a tower of strength to it.
If we were intending here to estimate the
exact value of the service done in these and
other ways by the Ritualist clergy, we should
be compelled to make many deductions.
But the point on which we wish to insist, is
simply the effect of their work in ministering
to the growth of High Church sentiment
in the country&mdash;a growth which has been
aided by the unwise opposition of the
Evangelicals, who have been too prone to oppose
every movement of Ritualist origin
without regard to its character. They have
thus not only enabled their opponents to
monopolise the entire credit of movements
which might just as consistently have been
undertaken by one party of the Church as
another, but have caused Evangelicalism to
be viewed by men of a more catholic spirit,
who belong to no party organization, but
are willing to accept wise suggestions from
whatever quarter they come, as obstructive
and impractical. The <i>&eacute;clat</i> which never
fails to attend activity and enterprise has
thus unfortunately remained with the Anglicans.</p>

<p>But while High Churchmen owe much of
their present position to themselves, or, to
speak more accurately, to the small but active
section who form their extreme left, it
cannot be denied that they have to some
extent been favoured by circumstances. There
are different characteristics of the age, distinct
from and even opposed to each other,
which have been friendly to them. They
have profited by its material prosperity, and
the consequent increase of its wealth and
luxury; and they have profited, though in
a different way, by its spirit of philosophic
inquiry, its intelligent freedom, its political
earnestness. A religion which delights in
show, which attaches high importance to
externals, which will be lenient in its judgments
of those who obey the priest and
regularly attend the sacraments, is certain to
find many votaries in an age when there are
such numbers who have no higher business
in life than the pursuit of mere pleasure.
The love of a new sensation alone is enough
to attract crowds of this class to a church
like St. Alban's. But it is not the novelty
alone which captivates them; it is the type
of religion which meets their tastes. It is
true that they may hear from the pulpit eloquent
denunciations of the frivolity of the
life they are leading, but these oratorical
thunders do not disturb them, save for the
time. It is a remarkable fact, indeed, which
has often been noticed, that sermons directed
against their own special sins are rather
popular than otherwise with hearers gathered
from the world of fashion. They listen
with interest, and if a preacher does his
work well, are, perhaps, moved to some degree
of sentimental emotion; they meekly
submit to the castigation which they have to
endure, and accept it as a species of penance
which is to be borne with all humility, and
having discharged what they consider a religious
duty, feel themselves entitled to return
with all the more zeal and avidity to
the scenes from which they have for a time
been withdrawn. They have had indeed the
virtues of an ascetic life set before them,
but they do not apply the exhortations to
themselves. These, they quietly assume, belong
to the 'religious,' the clergy, or those
who have a vocation to a more exalted type
of piety. For themselves, they are satisfied
with a much humbler <i>r&ocirc;le</i>; and if they are
regular at church, observe the Holy Communion
at proper times, and practise some
degree of abstinence on Fridays and in
Lent, they consider that they have amply
satisfied all the claims of conscience and religion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
If they are zealous at all, their zeal
is shown in a very different direction. They
leave to others all services demanding self-denial
or patience. They are never found
in the crowded alleys where the poor congregate,
visiting the sick or succouring the
needy. For the painful austerities which
some practise they have no love. It is by
the histrionic element that they are attracted.
To them the decorations of the church and
the vestments of the priests are subjects of
supreme interest. They go into ecstasies
over the cut of a chasuble or the colour of
a stole, can tell the exact difference between
a dalmatica and an alb, can give the most
orthodox opinion as to the colour proper to
each church festival, and are wonderfully
captivated with a religion in which millinery
plays an important part. 'You should (said
one of this class) visit &mdash;&mdash; church. It is
so delightfully high; the vestments are superb,
and the clergyman has got such dear
little boys, with red stockings, for acolytes.'</p>

<p>There is a better side of the system which
appeals to another and higher class, also to
be found in aristocratic circles. Repelled by
the wretched frivolity of fashionable society,
wearied of its incessant round of pleasure,
conscious that life ought to have some
higher end, and seeking after something to
satisfy the craving of their souls for the real
good,&mdash;they are taken by the ascetic view of
Christian life as given by High-Churchism.
The idea of an authority in the Church
which shall relieve them from the trouble of
deciding between the conflicting opinions
which are abroad, and shall give them some
resting-place in which they may find secure
footing and so be saved from the indifference
and unbelief into which such numbers
are drifting, is itself welcome. They are
pleased with the idea that they have the faith
held by the Catholic Church for centuries,
while the prospect of a life marked by self-sacrifice
and active labour is that above all
others the most calculated to kindle their
aspirations. Romanism has always had these
two sides by which it has attracted adherents
of the most opposite character; and
it is not surprising that Ritualism, which has
sought to follow so closely in its steps, should
exhibit the same characteristics with the
same results,&mdash;drawing from out the circles
of fashion both the superficial and frivolous,
who are captivated by its outward and objective
character, and the more earnest, who
are won by that ideal of a life with nobler
aims, and under the government of unselfish
principles which it exhibits before them.</p>

<p>The controversies of the day, too, have
helped the development of High Church
feeling. When a Church is or is supposed
to be in danger, when enemies are assailing
her from without, and some of her own adherents
are seriously compromising her character
and influence, and when there is a
need, therefore, for the display of special
zeal on the part of those who would maintain
her position, the party which is conspicuous
for the highest idea of her rights, and
for the most uncompromising spirit in their
assertion and defence, is sure to be specially
popular. High Churchmen have known
how to use to the utmost advantage the existing
state of things. By a singular coincidence,
the Judicial Committee have been
engaged in hearing the case of Mr. Voysey
on the one hand, and Mr. Mackonochie and
Mr. Purchas on the other; and although the
Vicar of St. Alban's and the Brighton Incumbent
have both been condemned, we
doubt whether the High Church will not
profit more by the spectacle presented by
Mr. Voysey than it will lose by the suspension
of Mr. Mackonochie or the prohibition
of the extravagancies of Mr. Purchas. By
the one, indeed, the High Church, as distinguished
from the Ritualist section, will gain,
rather than lose, if the result be the repression
of outrages upon Protestant feeling
and defiances of law, which check the sympathy
that otherwise would flow much more
decidedly in a High Church direction. By
the other, however, the gain is immediate
and very considerable. Here, we are told,
is the outcome of Protestantism. 'Rights
of private judgment, free inquiry, individual
responsibility&mdash;see to what they all lead us!
There is safety only in abiding by Catholic
truth, and submitting implicitly to the
authority of the Church which asserts it.
The assumed right of conscience which is
the basis of Protestantism is the root of all
evil, and the consequence of admitting it
will be an absolute eclipse of faith. Reject
the voice of the Church, and men will soon
cease to believe in the Bible, or even in God
at all.' There are not a few who receive all
this; even sincere lovers of Evangelical
principles will declare that they would rather
men should believe too much than believe
too little, forgetting that the one evil is tolerably
sure to be the cause of the other;
that it is just where the dominion of superstition
has been most absolute that, in the
inevitable sway of the pendulum, scepticism
becomes most rampant and powerful; and
that no more fatal error could be committed
by the friends of truth than to appeal to
ecclesiastical authority on its behalf. The
fact, however, is undeniable, and it is only
another illustration of the general law of
which we have just spoken, that in the reaction
from rationalizing views and the fear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
of their consequences, numbers are ready to
throw themselves into the sheltering arms of
High-Churchism. They love truth more
than liberty, and are content to surrender
the latter rather than brave the risk of any
danger to the former.</p>

<p>The progress of opinion in favour of the
separation of Church and State, so manifest
in different quarters, has produced a similar
effect. Anticipating the possibility of disestablishment
and of its coming soon, thoughtful
members of the Episcopal Church are
anxiously considering in what way she
will be best able to meet the difficulties
and demands of the novel position in
which she will find herself when she is
placed on a level with other Christian
churches. They see that when the prestige
of State connection is gone, something will
be necessary to make up for the loss which
she will sustain, and they hope to find it in
that exaltation of her claims in which High
Churchmen delight. In the view of High
Churchmen, the Evangelical who has nothing
on which to rely but his faithfulness and
power in carrying on the work of his ministry,
and who admits that the Congregational
minister by his side is on a level, so far as
authority is concerned, with himself, reduces
the Church to the position of the sects; and
in the competition which is provoked, she
will not necessarily be the gainer. What is
wanted, according to them, is that the clergy
should assert their prerogative. The maintenance
of an ornate and gorgeous ceremonial
is important, for it has been shown that
it has great attractions for the mass of the
people, and has been able to win back numbers
who, so long as simplicity was the
order of the day, saw no difference between
the service of a church and that of a dissenting
chapel, and, in fact, preferred the
latter because of its greater freedom and
warmth. But of still greater moment is it
that the Church should mark out distinctly
the line which separates her from the sects;
should insist on the authority which belongs
to her clergy as being in the true line of the
Apostolical succession, and should make it
felt that her members possess advantages in
which those outside her pale do not participate.
We do not believe that experience
will justify the policy, or that the pretensions
which are intolerable in an Established
Church would meet with anything but ridicule
when put forth by a Church which has
not even the special patronage of the State
to encourage such un-Christian arrogance.
In the meantime, this is a prevalent view,
and it is of material service to the party who
are contending for High Anglican principles.</p>

<p>From those various causes a High Church
spirit is showing itself far beyond both sections
of the clergy who have identified themselves
with Anglican movements, and, in fact,
is more or less affecting all parties. We
heard of a conversation the other day between
some laymen of extensive information
and strong Evangelical sympathies, in which
the question was asked in relation to a place
which had once been a stronghold of Evangelicalism,
'Are they not becoming rather high
at &mdash;&mdash;?' 'Where' (was the reply) 'is it
that they are not becoming high?' We have
taken some trouble to get information, and it
all goes to corroborate this view. There are
few of our larger towns, even those which
have been most distinguished for their zeal
for Evangelical principles, where we do not
find the intrusion of a High Church, and indeed,
a Ritualist element, which in some cases
may become strong and popular. We regret
to add that several of the Episcopal appointments
made by the present Government
must still further strengthen the hands and
encourage the hopes of the sacerdotal party.
Already we note some ominous signs in a
southern diocese, where, after the lengthened
rule of an Evangelical bishop, one of a very
different character&mdash;a prelate of great power
of eloquence and extraordinary tact, not to
say subtlety&mdash;has been appointed in his room.
Some of the Evangelical clergy have, we are
told, suddenly awakened to a perception of
the great worth of their new diocesan, and
are adopting practices which hitherto they
have condemned, and a tone which will certainly
be much more acceptable to him than
that which they have been accustomed to
maintain. We venture to predict, that if he
preside over the see for a few years, he will
be able to report a different state of things
from that which he found when he commenced
his administration. It is not probable
that he will so completely expel the Evangelical
element as, if we are to accept his own
statement, he had excluded Ritualism from
his late diocese, but we fear that his influence
may so transform some of his clergy that
their old friends will hardly be able to recognise
them. Whether Nonconformists have
any reason to congratulate themselves on this
result of the Liberal triumph to which they
so largely contributed, is a question on which
we need not enter. They do not owe so
much to the Evangelical prelates on the
bench, that they have any special reason to regret
that their number has not been augmented.
Still, the increase of the power of the
High Church party was not the direct and
immediate object for which they gave their
support to Mr. Gladstone; and we are bound
to say that the amount of encouragement
given to that party, both in the appointment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
of its members to important positions, and in
the favour shown to certain points of its policy,
has not been regarded with satisfaction.</p>

<p>One result of the new spirit that has been
awakened in the Anglican party, has been
the almost entire extinction of that particular
section of the Episcopal clergy known as the
'high and dry' school. So long, indeed, as
the present system of patronage continues, it
is never likely altogether to cease from among
us. While there are a considerable number
of livings in the gift of the Universities and
colleges, who appoint to them members of
their own body, who have lived so long
among the musty records of the past that
they have little fitness for the work of the
living present, who have, in fact, by the very
force of circumstances, became so many Dryasdusts;
and while there are a still larger
number regarded as the appanages of great
families, who give them to younger sons or
needy cousins, without any thought either of
their mental or spiritual qualifications, many
of the clergy are sure to be 'dry, yea, very
dry;' and because they are dry they will also
be high. They have nothing on which to
rest their claims except the authority of the
Church and the dignity of their office, and
they are sure to exalt the one and magnify
the other. Still, the section is a diminishing
one, and the Church may well rejoice
both that it is diminished in numbers, and that
what remains of it is improved in quality.
We have before our eyes now, one whom we
knew in our childhood, a quiet, dignified old
gentleman, who might have earned respect in
any other position but that of a clergyman.
He resided in the parish for many years, but
what influence for good he ever exerted upon
it, except by means of his charities, which
were always free enough, it would have puzzled
his admirers to tell. Of course, he had
a righteous horror of Dissent and Radicalism;
but even in opposition to them he never
showed any enthusiasm. Such men belong
to another generation, and where they are
found now occupying positions of importance,
in the midst of the busy life of this
nineteenth century, they only hold them to
the injury of the Church of which they are
the representatives.</p>

<p>The papers announced, a few weeks ago,
the death of one of this class, with some
facts of whose story we happen to be acquainted.
He was one of the few pluralists
who still remain, residing on one of his livings
in a midland county, and holding another
in a large manufacturing town in the
North of England. This town, with its
teeming population and growing importance,
he had never visited for more than twenty
years. The work was left to be done by two
curates, living on very inadequate incomes,
while their rector satisfied himself with drawing
the lion's share of the ample revenues of
the parish. He found more congenial employment
in the small village where his other
cure was situate, and where he discharged,
doubtless with becoming grace, the duties of
a country gentleman. A glimpse of his life
was given through a side-light in a speech of
one of his curates, who, in acknowledging
his rector's health, at a great agricultural dinner
in the town of which he was so negligent
an overseer, assured the company that the
rector would gladly have been present, as he
took a deep interest in all agricultural pursuits,
and was himself one of the most successful
breeders of pigs in the county of &mdash;&mdash;.
It is hardly necessary to say that Dissent has
a powerful hold upon the parish, or that
numbers have grown up in indifference, if
not in absolute hostility to religion altogether.
And yet even he was not of the worst
type. We remember, some years ago, driving
several miles in a midland district, with
a friend who was thoroughly acquainted with
the region and its history. The country was
rather thickly studded with churches and parsonages,
and, as we passed them, our friend
gave us some account of the men who had
lived and worked in them. Many of the livings
were in the gift of colleges and other
public bodies, while others were the property
of the country gentry, and, as might be expected,
the clergy had almost invariably been
of the 'high and dry' school; and as we
heard story after story of indolence, incompetence,
heresy, or, in some cases, ministerial
delinquency, we could not but feel that the
Church of England might well rejoice that
there are but few remaining of so unworthy
a generation.</p>

<p>The Anglican clergyman of to-day (and
the class is very numerous in rural districts)
is of a very different pattern. Even where
he has not actually embraced Ritualistic
opinions, he has generally breathed something
of their spirit, and is determined to
carry it into his work. He loves Dissent as
little as his 'high and dry' predecessor, but
he is determined to deal with it in a different
way. He is courteous in his manner toward
the Dissenting minister, but he means, all the
time, to 'stamp out' Dissent. But it is to
be done by outworking it everywhere&mdash;in
schools, in pastoral visitation, and in public
services; any weakness in preaching being
compensated by increased splendour of service.
It is impossible not to admire the intensity
of devotion with which some of these
young clergymen give themselves to their
work. A Congregational minister of our acquaintance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
was telling us of one of them
who had recently come to his neighbourhood,
and who was working a wondrous change
among a remarkably slothful and apathetic
people by the earnestness of his spirit and
the abundance of his labours. He had himself
been called to visit one of his own members,
and, though he immediately responded
to the summons, he found the clergyman already
there, proffering services of every kind,
and unwilling to accept a denial of his request
to sit up and watch all night by the
bedside of the sick man. The Nonconformist
convictions of a poor man must be very
clear and decided if he can be insensible to
such a mode of approach as this, and it was
only natural that, when he recovered, the recipient
of such kind attentions should be
found occasionally in the parish church. But
it is by means of the schools, especially, that
this gentleman and his class operate, and
operate to considerable effect. We are told,
and with some truth, that children cannot
enter into nice theological distinctions; but
it is not in theological subtleties that they are
instructed. The lessons given are plain and
intelligible enough, as to the rights of the
Church and the evils of Dissent, the reverence
due to a clergyman and the Church,
and the sin which they commit who neglect
to show it. Besides there are innumerable
ways in which, indirectly, both parents and
children are affected; and a clergyman
knows well enough, that when he has once
got a child to the national school, he has
taken the first step towards securing the parent
for the Church. Hence the resolute determination
of the clergy to get hold of the
education of the people, an attempt in which
they have been helped by those who, twenty-five
years ago, persuaded Nonconformists to take
up an untenable position that prevented their
just scruples from receiving proper attention,
and shut them out from a work in which
they had previously been the leaders. Hence,
too, the remarkable outburst of zeal and liberality
in the extension of denominational
schools since the passing of the late Act. Denominational
schools are, for the most part,
Anglican and Roman Catholic, and a large
proportion of the grant to them will, as a matter
of fact, go to build up the power of the
Establishment and suppress Dissent in the rural
districts. It is true the new national
schools will be under a conscience clause, but
they must be credulous indeed who believe
that it will be of much avail in parishes
where there is an active and influential clergyman,
wielding, in conjunction with the
squire, a supreme authority. A more potent
instrument could scarcely have been put into
the hands of the priesthood; and among the
young recruits of the Anglican party, there
are numbers who know how to wield it with
the greatest effect. They do not trust to the
influence of the teaching alone, but they find
various ways of interesting the children:
they form them into singing classes; they
prepare them for their choirs; they accustom
them to the observance of Saints' Days;
they please them by giving them a place in
processions, or employing them as acolytes.
In short, they find them in the National
schools, and they lose no opportunity of so
training them that they shall naturally grow
up to be loyal sons of the Church. We have
neither the intention nor the desire to reproach
them for the manner in which they
thus carry on their work, or for the care
which they specially devote to children. With
their views of the Church, they are only
showing a proper loyalty to conscience in the
course which they adopt. What we object
to is, that the nation should be called upon
to support them in this hierarchical crusade
by increasing the grants they now enjoy.
We have asserted from the first that schools
already in existence had a fair right to be left
undisturbed in the enjoyment of advantages
which the State had virtually engaged to secure
them, and which they had won by their
own efforts. What we complain of is, that
facilities should be given for the multiplication
of these denominational schools at the
very time that the Government are establishing
a great National system.</p>

<p>The National school, however, is not the
only theatre on which the activity of the advanced
Anglican priest is manifest. His
coming into a parish is the signal for a series
of changes, all directed to one end. First,
the interior of the church is to be remodelled
to adapt it to the style of service he means
to introduce. Pews which, it must be confessed,
are often unsightly enough, are displaced
to make way for benches. If it be
practicable, a part is railed off for a sanctuary;
and the altar, with its tall candlesticks,
and, where they can be obtained, with
its embroidered and coloured cloths, assumes
an entirely new aspect. Fast days and feast
days, hitherto unknown, begin to be celebrated;
intoning takes the place of the quiet
and orderly reading of the service, and by
degrees the people find their church and their
worship bear a striking, and, to many, not
pleasant resemblance to that of Romanism.
In all this there is no consultation, either of
diocesan or of parishioners. The clergyman
assumes the position of a dictator, and resolves
to carry out his own ideas, whatever be
the result. Sometimes there is fierce discord
and, not unfrequently, there are many secessions;
but even where this is not so, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
changes are, as we hear, in many cases anything
but satisfactory to the squirearchy, who
have hitherto been found among the most
steady supporters of the Church. They
valued it as furnishing a respectable and
quiet type of religion, which did not make
any excessive demands from them. Their
old High Church clergyman neither disquieted
himself nor disturbed them. He was a welcome
guest at their boards, and the slight
requisitions which he made, in the way of
subscriptions to his charities, were not particularly
burdensome, and were generally met
with cheerfulness. The new-fangled notions,
which make it a far more difficult thing to
be zealous Churchmen, requiring not only
money for schools and other objects, but
some amount of personal effort and sacrifice,
and often involving a man in unpleasant controversies
with his neighbours, are far from
being welcome, and already quiet murmurings
may be heard in various quarters.
We have given the party by whom this
work is carried on, all the credit to which
they can possibly lay claim. We are therefore
the more at liberty to condemn that
which is reprehensible; and one of their
most prominent features is their utter contempt
for the law to which they owe subjection.
Not content with adopting the most
pitiful evasions in order to introduce practices
contrary to the whole spirit of the
Church to which they belong, they have invented
a convenient theory of their own as
to the distinction between the law of the
Church and the law of the State, refusing to
obey the one when it comes into collision
with the other. In the economy of the
Episcopal Church, such a distinction cannot
be maintained for an hour. In the eye of
the law, the nation is the Church, with Parliament
as its legislator, and the courts as its
administrators. If any of the clergy feel
that their consciences are aggrieved by this
subjection to civil authority, they have the
remedy in their own hands. Nonconformity
has after a long and difficult struggle, succeeded
in obtaining for itself a recognised
legal status, and the liberty which it has thus
secured is opened to them, if they are content
to accept the conditions. They can
have the freedom, if they are satisfied to pay
the price at which it can be obtained.
What they cannot do, is to enjoy the advantages
which the law gives to the national
Church, without, at the same time, submitting
to its control. Their declamation about
the rights of the Church, and the iniquity of
any secular Parliament putting restraints on
its free action, or any civil tribunal undertaking
to adjudicate on matters of doctrine
and discipline, sounds well enough, but
coming from those who still claim to enjoy
the prestige and emoluments of a national
Church, it is simply idle bunkum which can
impose on no one. Were they manfully to
resolve rather to be free than to retain a
position which they can only hold on condition
of their disobeying what is to them
a higher law, they would command sympathy
from all who know how to honour loyalty
to conscience. As it is, their attempts to
represent themselves as victims of persecution
because they are required to obey the law,
expose them only to contempt and ridicule.</p>

<p>It is only fair to add that there is a considerable
section of the party by whom the force
of this reasoning is felt, and who are prepared
to carry their objections to State interference
to their ultimate issue.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'It would be' (says Mr. Orby Shipley, one of
the ablest and most fearless exponents of Ritualistic
views) 'the crowning labour; it would be
the culminating honour, it would be the blessed
consummation of the Catholic reformation to
be the means in the Divine economy of terminating
that wicked, immoral, and godless
alliance which, under present circumstances,
exists under the title of the Union of Church
and State.'
</p>
</div>

<p>How far it is consistent for any man to
lend his personal support to an alliance which
he pronounces 'wicked, immoral, and godless,'
by continuing to accept the advantages
which it secures to him, is a question which
his own conscience must be left to determine;
but it is at least satisfactory to find
that Mr. Orby Shipley and his friends have
begun to feel the inconsistency of their present
position. Whether in the event of the
Judicial Committee condemning their distinctive
principles, as it has already condemned
their symbolic practices, and deciding
against Mr. Bennett as it has done
against Mr. Purchas, they would secede
from the Establishment, is not very clear.
What is clear is, that they regard the present
relation of the State to the Church as hindering
the work of the 'Catholic' restoration,
and therefore seek disestablishment as the
first essential to the realization of their ideal.
But this cannot be brought about at once, and
in the meantime circumstances may force on
a separation. Perhaps, however, it is more
as a menace to the bishops than as an indication
of any serious purpose that Mr. Shipley
tells their lordships that the 'conspicuous
want of success which has attended Episcopal
hindrance to the Catholic revival has certainly
postponed, but has not at all removed
the prospect of impending schism.' We
are left to infer, therefore, that if the attempts
to repress Ritualism should be
crowned with more success than has hitherto
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
attended them, we must be prepared for
schism, which, Mr. Shipley says, would be
an untold evil to the Church; adding, and
in this we agree with him, 'that the present
state of abnormal antagonism, in any Christian
sense, is less harmful, it is hard to
believe.' If, however, this calamity should
come, he gives the Episcopal Bench to understand
that on them the responsibility
will rest.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'If they precipitate a schism, either by actively
hostile legislation, or by unconstitutional
illegality, or by the continuance of vexatious
antagonism, the sin of schism will rest upon
their individual consciences. Neither those
who see below the surface from without, nor
those within, who can feel the pulse of the
Catholic Party,<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> and know its deepest sentiments,
need to be told that the scandal of Episcopal
sanction and apology for the desecration
of the Blessed Sacrament in Westminster
Abbey, and the dishonour done to God's Holy
Word, by entrusting the revision of the Authorized
Version to heretics and schismatics, out
of which this scandal arose, has done more to
render such a schism possible than any other
act of the English bishops during the last half
century.'
</p>
</div>

<p>These thunders will not disturb the serene
complacency of the Episcopal Bench, nor
are such petulant utterances to be regarded
as indicating any serious idea of separation,
but their insolent and lawness tone is eminently
characteristic of the party. They have
formed their ideal of the Church, and in
defiance of all authority, whether civil or
spiritual, they are determined to work it out.
They know and confess that they are at variance
with the bishops, whom they have
promised 'reverently to obey,' 'following
with a glad mind and will their godly admonitions,
and submitting themselves to their
godly judgments;' but they have a convenient
theory as to the necessary limitations of the
obedience they are bound to render, by
which they satisfy themselves that they are
right in their resistance to the authority
which they have in the most solemn manner
bound themselves to accept. The
bishops 'are, it may be, good results, but
still they are results of a bad, vicious, immoral
system; of a system which is utterly
un-Catholic;' they have pronounced against
the Catholic revival from beginning to end,
and having thus set themselves against all
that 'priests of the Catholic school' are
doing, they have condemned themselves,
and forfeited all title to unlimited obedience,
by condemning these developments. In
other words, the want of harmony which they
confess exists between the mind of the Episcopate
and the mind of the Presbyterate is
a sufficient reason why priests should refuse
their allegiance. The conclusion is not that
which suggests itself to ordinary minds, but
these men are so thoroughly convinced that
they have Catholic truth, and are doing a
great Catholic work, that they seem to suppose
themselves superior to the laws by
which ordinary mortals are governed. They
may seem to be arrogant and overbearing,
they may indulge in railing and vituperation,
they may condescend to a style of controversy,
happily altogether cast aside by Christian
gentlemen, but everything is done in the
interests of the Catholic revival, and these are
to be advanced at all costs. Mr. Shipley candidly
avows that their aim is to 're-Catholicize
the Church of England,' and he appears to
think that because that object cannot be
secured without disobeying the bishops,
there is sufficient reason why they should
be disobeyed. After enumerating the
changes that require to be made in the
election of bishops and the remodelling of
Convocation, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'We have again to make confession the
ordinary custom of the masses, and to teach
them to use Eucharistic worship. We have to
establish our claims to Catholic Ritual in its
highest form. We have to restore the Religious
Life, to say Mass daily, and to practise Reservation
for the sick. Looking at these and
other more or less pressing needs of our communion,
I confidently ask, "Can these and
suchlike wants, in the providence of God, be
restored to His afflicted, and to this extent
indigent, Church, if we admit the theory of
limitless obedience, not, observe, to the Episcopate
combined in a Sacred College, but to any
or to all the individual members of the Bench
of Bishops?"'
</p>
</div>

<p>The simplicity of this is no doubt beautiful,
but its weakness is manifest. 'Limitless
obedience' no one expects them to render;
but the justification of their refusal to obey
at all, on the ground that disobedience is
necessary to their design of revolutionizing
the character of their Church, has
certainly the merit of novelty. They seem
to imagine that the first essential to success
is audacity, and expect that they will prevail,
in virtue of their blustering self-confidence
and contemptuous treatment of all
opponents. But the ultimate result of such
a policy cannot be doubtful. A party which
sets up a plea of liberty to excuse the violation
of distinct obligations, whose Catholicity has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
in it not a single element of true charity,
which seeks to subject others to authority
while it disclaims all authority that comes
into collision with its own ideas and designs,
which brands every man, however eminent
and good, who will not bow down to its idols
as a heretic or an infidel, is not a party that
is likely to exert any permanent influence.
The age is tolerant, disposed to permit great
latitude of opinion, perhaps too ready to
sympathise with those who are resisting constituted
authority, but it is not to be cajoled
by the specious sophistries of men who, professedly
contending for liberty, are seeking
only to establish a new priestly despotism.</p>

<p>But if we have no fears of Anglican
Catholics being able to shape the future of
the Church of England according to their
wishes, neither can we look hopefully on the
condition and prospects of the Evangelical
party. Thirty years ago it was the most
popular and influential, if not the most
numerous section of the Church. Its most
sanguine friend would hardly pretend that
it holds the same position to-day. We have
already marked incidentally the disadvantage
under which it lay in contending against a
party full of the passionate zeal and energy
of youth, and with ability equal to its earnestness,
its members claiming to be <i>par excellence</i>,
the assertors of Church principles and
the champions of Church interests, skilful in
adapting themselves to the wants of different
classes of minds, fertile in expedients, and indefatigable
in labours. Under any circumstances,
it would have been no easy task to
have maintained an equal struggle against
such adversaries, hampered as the Evangelicals
necessarily are by their position in the
Church. Still they had many compensating
advantages, and had they known how to
avail themselves of the forces at their command,
they might not only have held their
ground, but have been to-day masters of the
situation. In the great conflict which has
been going on between authority and freedom,
the reactionary forces are not the
strongest, and had the Evangelicals been
prepared fully to identify themselves with
the cause of liberty, they need not have
feared the result of the struggle. They had
on their side the prestige of the noble work
which they had done in rousing the Church
from torpor and idleness, and in regaining
for her much ground that she had lost, in
quickening the spiritual life of the nation, in
promoting social and philanthropic movements
at a time when they were not viewed
with so much favour as at present. As the
representatives of Protestantism in the National
Church, they were able to rally to
their support a strong national sentiment,
not always very intelligent or reasonable,
but deep and passionate in its hatred
of everything that has on it the taint of
Romanism, and only too easily roused in
opposition to any party which could fairly
be suspected of Popish sympathies. Their
position, too, seemed to mark them out as
the connecting link between the Established
Church and the Nonconformists. Their
theological views, if not identical, were in
close sympathy with those of Evangelical
Dissenters: they were frequently brought
into association in Christian work, and had
often to fight side by side against the common
foe; and though there never was a
chance that the Nonconformists could be won
back to the Church, kindly and intimate relations
might have been established with them,
which would have told greatly to the credit
of the party by whom they had been promoted.
Yet with all these circumstances in
its favour, the Evangelical party has been
declining. Its enemies point to it with
triumph, and exaggerate the weakness over
which they rejoice. Its friends reluctantly
confess it, and find the explanation in the
wickedness and degeneracy of the age.</p>

<p>The tone of a recent gathering of the
leaders of the party at Islington shows that
they are conscious of the fact, and alive to the
necessity of making some strenuous effort,
perhaps of effecting a considerable change in
their policy, in order to recover the ground
that has been lost. To outsiders, however,
the real causes of their weakness may be
more apparent than to themselves, and we
shall therefore attempt to explain a state of
things which we unfeignedly regret. The
Episcopal Church, whether Established or
not, must be one of the most powerful religious
forces in the country, and we must
desire to see its influence wielded by men
whose theology is that of the Reformers,
who recognise the rights of the individual
conscience, whose creed is derived from the
Bible and not from Church tradition, who
preach salvation by faith in the living Christ,
and have no confidence in priests and sacraments.
It would therefore be cause of
sorrow to us, as it will assuredly in the issue
prove disastrous to the Church and injurious
to the nation, if the Evangelical party should
be overborne in the present struggle, its
power crippled, or its character so modified
as to impair its usefulness. We are fully
alive to its defects. As Nonconformists, we
have little for which to be thankful to it;
but not the less should we deplore the loss
of what has been the most spiritual element
in the Church, and therefore we can only regard
with sorrow the state of things of which
we have to speak.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span></p>

<p>The decline of the Evangelical party is
attributed by many, both friends and foes,
to a growing distaste for evangelical doctrine.
The age, we are often confidently
told by those in whom the wish is father to
the thought, has outgrown the old theology;
it is too intelligent to rest in the dogmas
which were once received without question;
the leading spirits of the time are known to
be unbelievers, and that fact itself is sufficient
to make unbelief a fashion among a class
who desire to be esteemed intellectual. Very
sorrowfully we admit there is some ground
for these statements, but they are only half-truths.
The philosophic and scientific movements
of the day, have undoubtedly affected
theological opinion; the spirit of inquiry has
become more searching in its investigation;
the rebellion against the bondage of creed
has, in some instances, led to an indifference
to all forms of belief; and in general, doctrines
that were thought to be established,
are discussed with freedom, and rejected
when they do not stand the more severe tests
by which they are proved. Orthodoxy counts
for less in the estimate of Christian character,
and there is less disposition to condemn
any man because of his inability to accept
all its shibboleths. But all this does not indicate
that the power of the Gospel is diminishing;
and, indeed, there are many things
that point in the opposite direction. Preaching
<i>qu&acirc;</i> preaching may be less influential;
but the preaching which is a power at all,
never was a greater power than it is at present.
Men chafe against the notion that it
is their duty to hear a certain number of
sermons, even though they be made up of
platitudes rendered additionally wearisome
by the style in which they are delivered;
but where a preacher has a message from
God, and knows how to deliver it he is
quite sure of having a large audience. Nor
is it at all likely to be diminished by the
fact that his sermon is decidedly evangelical
and even strongly dogmatic. We have
popular Ritualist as well as popular Evangelical
preachers; but the discourses of the
former are in their leading features as decidedly
evangelical as those of the latter.
Indeed, at the conference at Islington, it was
frankly admitted that whatever might be the
actual condition of the party, the doctrines
for which it contends were never so widely
preached by the clergy as at present. Certainly,
the Nonconformist Churches know
no decline, nor is their prosperity to be
traced to any abandonment or concealment
of evangelical doctrines. Congregationalists,
accustomed as they are to breathe the atmosphere
of freedom, and unfettered by the restraints
of any formal creed, have, perhaps,
felt more of the influences of the age than
any other body of Christians; but no one
who is acquainted with them would assert
that they have at all faltered in their loyalty
to the Gospel. Perhaps one of the best
proofs of this is to be found in the essays in
'Ecclesia.' Their writers speak with great
frankness; they admit many defects in their
system, and suggest various changes; they
are anxious, as far as possible, to adapt
themselves to the wants of the age; but
withal, there is a consistent adherence to the
essential principles of the old theology.
Changes in the forms in which doctrines are
expressed, differences in the modes of expounding
and defending them there are, but
change as to the root-ideas there is none.
And Congregationalism upholding the great
truths of the Trinity, the Godhead of our
Lord, and the Atonement, and basing all on
the authority of Scripture, not only maintains
its ground despite the opposition it has
to meet from the renewed activity of the
Established Church, but is on the increase.</p>

<p>If, then, the Evangelicals are decreasing in
numbers and influence, the cause must be
sought in some errors in their policy, and
not in the increased unpopularity of the
principles they profess. We are confirmed
in this view by the refusal of some of the
best men of the day to identify themselves
with the party, even though they hold the
principles. It would be invidious to name
living men; but there is one recently passed
from among us, to the great loss not of his
own particular Church only, but of all Christian
Churches, who affords, perhaps, the
most striking illustration of the remark.
Others there are, of whom the late Canon
Melville may be taken as a type, whose High-Church
ideas are sufficient to prevent them
from uniting with a party with whom in
doctrinal sentiment they have much in common.
But the Dean of Canterbury, we need
not say, had no such hindrance. Mr. Ryle
himself is not more free from any tinge of
ecclesiasticism, as he certainly is not more
heartily and thoroughly Evangelical, than
was Dean Alford. Yet the latter stood aloof
from the Evangelical party; and they, we
fear, did not desire his union with them.
His case was a typical one, and enables us to
understand the enfeebled state in which the
Evangelicals find themselves. They did not
like the Dean's breadth of view; they regarded
the opinions on the subject of inspiration,
to which his Biblical studies had led
him, as unsound and dangerous; they did
not understand, what was one of his marked
characteristics, a large-hearted sympathy
with goodness even in the professors of a
false creed. So, though he was educated in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
the school, and (as the Rev. E. T. Vaughan
truly says) though he 'preached the Gospel
which they preached with a force and simplicity
which they might well have wished
to emulate,' they looked coldly on him, and
he could find no home in their midst.</p>

<p>Here, then, is one great secret of their loss
of influence. Their ideas of Evangelical
doctrine are narrow and rigid, and they are
maintained with an intolerance which is at
once repulsive and inconsistent. We complain
that the 'Catholic' champions of authority
should demand for themselves that
individual liberty for which Protestantism
contends, but it is still more intolerable that
these Protestants of Protestants should set up
a claim to infallibility, and brand all those
who do not agree with them as traitors to the
Gospel. By maintaining the verbal inspiration
of Holy Scripture, insisting on a particular
theory of the Atonement as alone
Evangelical, committing themselves to a
particular scheme of prophetic interpretation,
and adhering to those old ideas of the
religious life which make worldliness to consist
in certain outward acts which are therefore
forbidden to the spiritual man, rather
than in the world-spirit which can make
everything common and unclean, and which
is the evil to be resisted, they have placed
themselves in direct collision with the culture
of the age&mdash;even that part of it which retains
a hearty allegiance to the Gospel. But
when with these extreme views is combined
a spirit of intolerant conservatism, when new
modes of thought, and even new forms of
expression are regarded as dangerous novelties,
when all wisdom is supposed to be
summed up in the determination to walk in
the old paths and to meddle not with those
who are given to change, and when those
who dare, even in relation to subjects that do
not affect the essentials of the faith, to take
independent ground are treated as enemies
of the truth, it is not difficult to account for
the weakness of the party. A creed that is
not only unpopular, and in some points illogical,
but which can be regarded as the
creed only of a section, and that not the
most intelligent section of Evangelical
Christians, and which is yet set forth as the
only true representation of the Gospel, must
alienate many; but a spirit of exclusiveness,
a Pharisaic pride of orthodoxy, a dislike of
free inquiry, are sure to alienate still more.</p>

<p>It may be said, indeed, that the dogmas
of the Anglican school are still more narrow
and extreme, and its intolerance still more
arrogant and exclusive; but this does not
mend the case. The intolerance of the Anglicans
is extreme enough, but then it is
consistent. Their system is based upon the
assumption of a special sanctity and authority
belonging to their Church party. The
name of 'Catholic' which they arrogate to
themselves is itself an insult to all other
Christians. For them, therefore, to abjure
the spirit of exclusiveness would be to renounce
their own principles. But the Evangelicals
are in a very different position. They
are the children not of the bond-woman, but
of the free. They rest their doctrines not on
an appeal to authority, but to reason. The
Scripture is their one rule of faith, and they
recognise the right of every man to interpret
its teachings for himself. When, therefore,
they attempt to put a bar on all progress,
when they claim for the traditions of
their school a position hardly less authoritative
than that which their opponents demand
for 'Catholic' tradition, when they discover
a spirit of watchful jealousy in relation to
all the intellectual movements of the day, and
seem afraid of the light which science and
philosophy have to shed upon the difficult
problems of human life, they are untrue to
themselves and their principles. Their
watchword is, 'The Bible and the Bible only
as the religion of Protestants,' but with them
there is a reserved condition that the Bible
must be interpreted as Puritans and Reformers
interpreted it. They are afraid of the
liberty to which they owe their existence,
and are continually throwing themselves back
on that Church authority which, if it is to
be accepted at all, will pronounce in favour
of their opponents.</p>

<p>It is this ignorance of their true strength
which has betrayed the Evangelicals into
errors of policy which have been fraught
with serious injury. As Protestants, they
ought to have been the most liberal party in
the Church; the most desirous to secure the
greatest liberty compatible with loyalty to
truth; the most ready to welcome every advance
in scholarship that might help to a
more thorough understanding of the Word
of God; the most candid in examining and
pronouncing upon the conclusions which
modern Biblical criticism has reached; the
most anxious to establish cordial relations
with Nonconformists outside the pale of the
Church. Unhappily, the very opposite of
this has been the case. They have left to
others the duty of practically developing
those Protestant principles of which they
claim to be the representatives, and have
again and again employed their influence in
favour of the party of reaction. The spectacle
which they have presented in the ecclesiastical
controversies of the last few years
has, indeed, been humiliating in the extreme.
They have been the most timid in every
panic,&mdash;the first to raise the cry of danger,&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
most eager in the assault, whether upon
Rationalists within or Dissenters outside the
Church&mdash;the facile instruments of the High
Church party, whose leaders have gladly accepted
their aid, knowing well that any
prestige or advantage that might be secured
must remain with those who were the consistent
champions of authority. At present
they are the most zealous champions of the
Establishment, and their organ the most
Erastian in its tone of any of the journals of
the day. Yet there is no party which owes
so little to the Establishment, or would have
so glorious a future before it if the union
between the Church and the State were dissolved.
Except during the brief interval
when Lord Palmerston scattered mitres so
lavishly in its ranks, it has had but a scant
share of the higher honours of that Church
which owes so much to the devoted labours
of its members. Even of the more important
parochial charges, but a small proportion
is held by the Evangelicals, many of
whose ablest men are the incumbents of
churches dependent entirely upon voluntary
contributions for their support. If the Evangelical
leaders would make a careful estimate
of the exact position of the two parties in
the Church, and of the amount of the national
revenues which go to the maintenance
of that which they are continually telling us
is deadly error as compared with that which
is devoted to the support of their own principles,
we think they would be inclined to
doubt the wisdom of the position they take
in relation to the Establishment. That they
who ought to have the most confident faith
in the spiritual forces of the Church, and
whose own experience affords ample proof
that that faith would not be misplaced,
should cling the most tenaciously to the
union with the State, with all its painful and
compromising conditions, is surely a strange
phenomenon. Yet this is not the worst of
the case. Unfortunately, their zeal for the
Establishment is not allied with charity, and
their characteristic intolerance marks their
treatment of those Nonconformists who feel
themselves constrained to seek the dissolution
of an alliance which they believe to be
contrary to the mind of Christ and injurious
to the interests of truth. Apparently unable
to understand that this difference of opinion
is perfectly consistent with the preservation
of Christian unity and mutual respect, they
have resented the assertion of Nonconformist
principles as a personal injury, and have
urged it as a sufficient reason for withdrawing
from Christian intercourse with those
who have been guilty of so flagrant an offence.
They expected that Dissenters would
purchase their friendship by unfaithfulness
to their own principles, and have been disappointed
and indignant when they have
discovered their mistake. If Nonconformists
will play the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of poor relations, content
to receive a patronizing notice on the
platforms of Bible and Missionary Societies,
and for the sake of this to suppress their
own convictions, they are willing to be on
terms of kindly intercourse with them; but
that they should presume on this, and venture
to assert their religions equality, is more
than they will tolerate. The inevitable result
has been a division between two parties
who have much in common, and whose union
would have been a tower of strength to Evangelical
Protestantism.</p>

<p>We should not care to have written thus
fully on these points, but for the conviction
that we are on the eve of important ecclesiastical
changes, and that the character of the
future will depend largely upon the position
taken by the Evangelical party. The Broad
Church dream of comprehension must remain
a dream. It is beautiful, and it speaks
much for the liberality of men trained amid
the influences and associations of an Established
Church, that they should have indulged
in such a hope. But it cannot be
realized. Nonconformists do not wish for a
place in the National Church, and could not
accept one without the renunciation of all
for which they have been contending. And
assuredly, the recent meetings at Sion College
show that a large and powerful party in
the Establishment have no desire for union
with them. But if comprehension is impossible,
disestablishment must come, and come
speedily, and with it will come a new phase
of the great struggle. 'I disbelieve,' said
Mr. Orby Shipley, himself an able advocate
of the separation between Church and State,
'in anything but a change in the contest of
the Church militant, a change from a contest
against the State without to a contest within,
against Puritanism, against Latitudinarianism,
against Infidelity, and against what may
be termed "Lay-elementarianism in the
Church."' The sacerdotal party believes
that its position in this struggle will be improved
by disestablishment; but if the
Evangelicals are loyal to their Protestant
principles, we predict that it will find itself
mistaken. Disestablishment will remove
the one obstacle to hearty co-operation between
the two great sections of English
Protestantism, and united, they will be fully
able to withstand the fierce onslaught with
which they are threatened. But if the
Evangelicals are to play their part in this
controversy, the sooner they choose their
position, and resolve to hold it firmly, the
better. Two great principles are daily coming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
more and more directly into conflict,
and they must elect to abide by the one or
by the other. They must abandon all tamperings
with the delusive fancy of an apostolical
succession, or of special virtue attaching
to Episcopal ordination. They must
cease the foolish coquetting in which a few
of them seem disposed to indulge with
High Church ideas and practices, they must
show a broader spirit and cultivate closer relations
with those of kindred opinions who
do not belong to their party or even to their
Church; in short, they must not shrink from
the full development of their own principles,
and they will soon regain the strength
which has been lost by the timid and compromising
policy of the past.</p>

<p>Meanwhile it is evident that the Establishment
is on the eve of a great crisis. The
condemnation of Mr. Purchas has goaded
the High Church party, some almost to
madness; and should it be followed by a
decision against Mr. Bennett, it is not easy
to predict the result. Indeed, be the deliverance
of the Court what it may, 'there are
breakers ahead.' If it be against the Vicar
of Frome, it will be fatal to the hopes both
of Anglican and Broad Churchmen. It will
compel the former to secede, for we believe
the body of them to be honest men who
will not renounce principles which they hold
to be the very essence of Catholic doctrine.
It will teach the latter that their dream of
comprehension is at an end. On the other
hand, a decision in his favour will not conciliate
the Ritualists, since it will still leave
them subject to the restrictions imposed by
the Mackonochie and Purchas judgments,
while the Evangelicals in their turn will be
placed in extreme perplexity. At present
the Church Association is in the ascendant.
We wish we could say that its deportment
in the hour of victory was such as to assure
us in relation to the future of the Evangelical
party. We cannot wonder that it is jubilant,
but wisdom would have suggested some
moderation in the expression of its joy, especially
considering that the decision yet to
be given may prove that its exultation has
been as premature as it certainly is undignified
and impolitic. We read the report of
the meeting at St. James's Hall to celebrate
the victory with extreme pain and sorrow.
The evident failure to realise the gravity of
the crisis, the unseemly tone adopted towards
defeated adversaries, the apparent unconsciousness
of the scandal such a strife is
bringing upon the Church and upon religion
in general, and perhaps more than all, the
disposition to rest so much on the power of
the law, are all indicative of extreme weakness.
Men who can talk in the style of the
Dean of Carlisle clearly do not comprehend
the spirit of the times or the true position of
the party which they represent. They seem
to think they can stamp out High Churchism
at all events, in its more advanced forms.
They do not appear to understand that,
could they succeed, they would secure the
downfall of that Establishment which they
love 'not wisely and too well.' If they
would think less of law, and remember that
the true weapons of their warfare are not
carnal, but spiritual, they would take a position
more in harmony with their principles,
and be more sure of ultimate success.</p>

We English are, assuredly, a humorous

than any other; this is shown, not only in
Chaucer, Shakspeare, Butler, Sterne, Dickens,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
but in the incidents of our country
and city life, in the quaint colloquy and light
chaff of the market-place and the way-side.
'Merry England,' is an ancient phrase; and
there is much merriment in our modern
England that is not always observed by philosophers
and politicians. We happen to
have walked through most English counties,
and to have enjoyed the marvellous differences
of humour which exist through the
breadth of the land. We have tracked
Shakspeare through Central Warwick; have
trodden the paths of Wordsworth and Coleridge
and Wilson, in the realm of lakes;
have talked with moormen on Dartmoor,
and with shrimpers at Poulton-le-Sands.
Everywhere we have encountered a joyous
humour, inextinguishable by poverty and
toil&mdash;a humour clearly designed to lighten
men's hearts in their passage through a
world of many troubles. Recognising this,
we think that any form of humour is worth
cultivation, and that a writer like Barham,
who, to many grave thinkers, might seem a
lover of ineffable nonsense, was not without
his use in the world.</p>

<p>Three things may be affirmed in his
favour. He caused good honest laughter,
by telling stories in a ridiculous style, without
writing a word to which the most absolute
purist could object. He ridiculed foolish
and superstitious legends, blowing them
away as the winds of the vernal equinox blow
the dead wood from the trees. And he
proved that the position of a minister of religion,
doing his duty in a manner thoroughly
conscientious, was not inconsistent with a
pleasant mirthfulness of temper. Of him
we may say, as Rosaline of Biron&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="i1">'A merrier man,</p>
<p>Within the limit of becoming mirth,</p>
<p>I never spent an hour's talk withal.'</p>
</div>

<p>And, with all his merriment, Barham did
not for a moment neglect his clerical duty;
indeed, there are indications that he was a
remarkably good specimen of the parson of
the parish. If we found any fault with this
biography, which is, for the most part, well
executed, it is that Barham's life as a clergyman
is too slightly indicated. His friend,
Mr. Hughes, father of the member for
Frome, wrote of him thus in the <i>New
Monthly</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'It is not always an easy task to do as you
would be done by; but to think as you would
be thought of and thought for, and to feel as
you would be felt for, is perhaps more difficult,
as superior powers of tact and intellect are
here required to second good intentions. These
faculties, backed by an uncompromising love
of truth and fair dealing, indefatigable good
nature, and a nice sense of what was due to
every one in the several relations of life, both
gentle and simple, rendered our late friend invaluable,
either as an adviser or peacemaker,
in matters of difficult and delicate handling.
How he managed to get through his more important
duties is a marvel. Certain it is that
they were well and punctually performed in
every point relating to cathedral matters, as
well as his engagements as a parochial incumbent
and priest of the Household, which, I believe,
was the nature of his office at the Chapel
Royal.'
</p>
</div>

<p>This testimony from one who knew him
well, makes us regret that more of Barham's
parochial life has not been revealed to us.
Often there is a curious difference between
the practical and the literary half of a
man's career. <i>A priori</i>, one would not expect
the 'Lay of St. Cuthbert' to be the
work of a Canon of St. Paul's. More information
as to Barham's clerical career
would have been intensely interesting to the
psychological student; but his filial biographer
has refrained from entering on the subject
to any extent. We are not certain as
to his motive. Perhaps he thought it hopeless
to persuade the world that a good parson
could be a lover of fun. Well, another
lover of fun was one Sydney Smith, well
known to all of us, also a Canon of St.
Paul's. Smith was a resolute Whig, Barham
a high Tory, yet were they excellent
good friends. Here is proof. Barham sent
Smith some game: here is the other Canon's
epigrammatic ironic reply:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'Many thanks, my dear sir, for your kind
present of game. If there is a pure and elevated
pleasure in this world, it is the roast
pheasant and bread sauce&mdash;barn-door fowls
for Dissenters, but for the real Churchman,
the thirty-nine times articled clerk&mdash;the pheasant,
the pheasant!</p>

<p class="i1">'Ever yours,<br />
<span class="smcap i2">'Sydney Smith.'</span></p>
</div>

<p>The pheasant for rectors, the fowl for Dissenters&mdash;a
characteristic bit of chaff from
Peter Plymley to Tom Ingoldsby. In these
days, after wonderful rapidity of movement,
when the questions which troubled the last
generation have been merged in others far
deeper and wider, it is pleasant to think of
Whig and Tory in the same cathedral precinct&mdash;Tory
sending Whig some game, and
Whig replying with a gibe at all dwellers
without the orthodox limits. Few years
have passed, yet the atmosphere is marvellously
clearer; there is not precisely the
same relation between Conformist and Nonconformist.
The pheasant and the barn-door
fowl are rather more equally distributed,
perhaps.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Barham's son and biographer thus
states his determination not to record his
father's clerical life. 'With the details of
his experience as a clergyman, rarely suitable
for publication as such particulars are, I
do not propose to deal. Of course, an outline
will be given of his professional progress;
but the reader must, once for all, be
requested to bear in mind that it is intended,
in the following pages, simply to throw together
some slight records of his leisure
hours and recreative pursuits.' This design
has been very well executed; but we certainly
think that more might be done. However,
we must perforce accept the editor's
view of the matter, and learn what we can
of his father by sidelong glimpses of him.
Taken solely as a man of letters, Barham is
well worth study. Taken as husband and
father, he is delightful. His correspondence
with his children is equal to Tom Hood's
letters to infant friends, though in quite a
different style. His nonsense, prose or verse,
was always pleasant nonsense. Thus he
writes to his daughter Fanny:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'What do you think of Mr. Sydney Smith
having offered me his residentiary house to live
in, together with a garden at the back&mdash;magnificent
for London&mdash;containing three polyanthus
roots, a real tree, a brown box border, a
snuff-coloured jessamine, a shrub which is
either a dwarf acacia or an overgrown gooseberry
bush, eight broken bottles, and a tortoiseshell
tom-cat asleep in the sunniest corner;
the whole, as George Robins would say,
capable of the greatest improvement; with a
varied and extensive prospect of the back of
the Oxford Arms, and a fine hanging wood (the
new drop at Newgate) in the distance, all being
situate in the midst of a delightful neighbourhood,
and well worth the attention of any capitalist
wishing to make an investment....</p>

<p>There is work enough cut out for you, I
promise you, when you get back: eighteen jars
of onions to pickle, as many double-damson
cheeses to press, some dozen niggers to boil
into black currant jelly, and jams and marmalades
to make without end; for, unfortunately
for you and all other females connected with
the family, the new house is provided with
that domestic curse, a roomy store-closet. So,
my dear old Fan, make hay or dirt pies, which
is the same thing, while you can, in comfort.'
</p>
</div>

<p><i>Pater peramans</i>, evidently. Here again is
a pleasant piece of chaff addressed to the
same young lady, on 'having nothing to
say' in a letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'As your correspondence increases, my dear
girl, you will find that this having nothing to
say, and being obliged to say it, will be one of
the great and incipient stumbling blocks of
your literary life. Nothing, in fact, is so difficult
to express&mdash;that is, with any degree of
propriety&mdash;as nothing; and when once you
have attained a proficiency in this, your education
may be considered to be to a certain extent
completed. Till then many people may
think, and may assure you, that you know
nothing, but do not believe them. You may
know, and I dare say do, very little; but to be
thoroughly acquainted with nothing requires
not only a great deficiency of talent far below
the common run of intellect, but also a want
of application which, though it is possible you
may possess it in a very considerable degree, I
have never yet seen in you to the extent absolutely
requisite.'
</p>
</div>

<p>So easy and regular was the course of
Barham's life, that there is really nothing to
say about it. As landowner, Canon of St.
Paul's, parson of a City church, he moved
pleasantly in society, and had only to encounter
life's inevitable troubles. We remember
him in our hot youth, at the long-extinct
Chapter Coffee-house in St. Paul's
churchyard, whose landlord bore the appropriate
name of Faithful, improvising marvellous
verses over a glass of antique port.
Perhaps his life was almost too facile; perhaps
men of serious temperament would regard
such productions as the 'Ingoldsby
Legends' as things intolerable: but Barham
had his mission, depend on it, and if you
go to a 'Penny Reading' in the country
any winter evening, the chances are that you
will get selections from 'Pickwick' or from
'Ingoldsby,' whatever else may greet your
ear. Everybody knows Sam Weller and
Tiger Tim&mdash;both typical man-servants:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'Tiger Tim was clean of limb,</p>
<p>His boots were polished, his jacket was trim;</p>
<p>With a very smart tie in his smart cravat,</p>
<p>And a smart cockade on the top of his hat;</p>
<p>Tallest of boys, or shortest of men,</p>
<p>He stood in his stockings just four foot ten;</p>
<p>And he asked, as he held the door on the swing,</p>
<p>"Pray, did your lordship please to ring?"'</p>
</div>

<p>Everybody also recollects that rascally 'Jackdaw
of Rheims'&mdash;related, doubtless, to the
<i>graculus superbus</i> of Phaedrus&mdash;who stole
the Cardinal's ring just as his Latin predecessor
stole the peacock's feathers. There is
no <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> extant equal to this
whimsical legend. Excommunication, which
was slightly damaged in value by the curse
of Ernulphus, came to a ridiculous end when
the Cardinal Lord Archbishop of Rheims
tonitrated his worst maledictions at a thievish
jackdaw. 'Maledictus sit vivendo, moriendo,
manducando, bibendo, esuriendo, sitiendo,
jejunando, dormitando, dormiendo,
vigilando, ambulando, stando, sedendo, jacendo,
operando, quiescendo,' &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'The Cardinal rose with a dignified look,</p>
<p>He called for his candle, his bell, and his book.</p>
<p>In holy anger and pious grief,</p>
<p>He solemnly cursed the rascally thief.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span></p>
<p>He cursed him at board, he cursed him in bed,</p>
<p>Prom the sole of his foot to the crown of his head;</p>
<p>He cursed him in sleeping, that every night</p>
<p>He should dream of the devil, and wake in fright;</p>
<p>He cursed him in eating, he cursed him in drinking.</p>
<p>He cursed him in coughing, in sneezing, in winking,</p>
<p>He cursed him in sitting, in standing, in lying;</p>
<p>He cursed him in walking, in riding, in flying,</p>
<p>He cursed him in living, he cursed him in dying:</p>
<p>Never was heard such a terrible curse.</p>
<p class="i3">But what gave rise</p>
<p class="i3">To no little surprise&mdash;</p>
<p>Nobody seemed one penny the worse.'</p>
</div>

<p>When after awhile the mystery was out&mdash;
when the poor little comminated jackdaw
presented himself in a sad state, so that of
the cathedral officers, sacristans, and vergers,
and the like, it is recorded,</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'That heedless of grammar, they all cried,</p>
<p>"That's him!"'</p>
</div>

<p>the absurdity reached its climax. For our
own part, though these humours are not of
the highest or deepest order, we laugh at
them. Life has its follies; Shakspeare had
his clowns. In the old forgotten coaching
days, there was wonderful humour at the
wayside inns. Sam Weller was possible
then: a railway porter has no time to be
humorous. Of the Ingoldsby humour, as
practised by Barham himself, there is this
to be said: it was always harmless, and it
was directed against absurdity and nonsense.
Ingoldsby has had disciples, who have not
disgraced their master, yet who have never
quite equalled him in certain peculiar points.
There is Hood's admirable story of 'Miss
Killmannsegg,' wherein, if we remember
aright, he depicts certain folks as&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'Washing, their hands with invisible soap</p>
<p class="i3">In imperceptible water.'</p>
</div>

<p>There is Praed's 'Red Fisherman:'&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'All alone, by the side of the pool,</p>
<p>A tall man sat on a three-legged stool,</p>
<p>Kicking his heels on the dewy sod,</p>
<p>And putting in order his reel and rod.</p>
<p>Red were the rags his shoulders wore,</p>
<p>And a high red cap on his head he bore;</p>
<p>His arms and his legs were long and bare,</p>
<p>And two or three locks of long red hair</p>
<p>Were tossing about his scraggy neck,</p>
<p>Like a tattered flag o'er a splitting wreck.</p>
<p>It might be time, or it might be trouble,</p>
<p>Had bent that stout back nearly double;</p>
<p>Sunk in their deep and hollow sockets</p>
<p>That blazing couple of Congreve rockets,</p>
<p>And shrunk and shrivelled that tawny skin,</p>
<p>Till it hardly covered the bones within.</p>
<p>The line the Abbot saw him throw</p>
<p>Had been fashioned and formed long ages ago,</p>
<p>And the hands that worked his foreign vest</p>
<p>Long ages ago had gone to rest:</p>
<p>You would have sworn, as you looked on them,</p>
<p>He had fished in the flood&mdash;with Ham and Shem.'</p>
</div>

<p>Then, again, there is Browning's 'Pied
Piper of Hamelin,' a rare old story rarely
versified:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="i2">'Rats!</p>
<p>They fought the dogs, and killed the cats,</p>
<p class="i1">And bit the babies in the cradles,</p>
<p>And eat the cheeses out of the vats,</p>
<p class="i1">And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles,</p>
<p>Split open the kegs of salted sprats,</p>
<p>Made nests inside men's Sunday hats,</p>
<p>And even spoiled the women's chats,</p>
<p class="i2">By drowning their speaking</p>
<p class="i2">With shrieking and squeaking</p>
<p>In fifty different sharps and flats.'</p>
</div>

<p>There is vast difference between the
three writers; the courtly epigram of Praed,
and the scholarly variety of Browning, differ
widely from the style of the master whom
they imitate. But it is a high testimony to
the literary value of what we may call the
Ingoldsby method, that men so original and
so desperate have tried their hands at it. A
glance at the 'Bentley Ballads' shows that
the same thing has been done by a great
number of very different men; Sheehan and
Creasy, Maginn and Mahony, Sam Lover the
versatile, whom we remember delighting us
with improvisations at Barnes-terrace just
above the Thames, Tom Ingoldsby's son who
follows his father with filial felicity, have
done excellently well in this style of spirit
and humour.</p>

<p>Indeed, to succeed in it to a certain
degree, demands only abundance of animal
spirits and a capacity for rhythm and rhyme.
But it is clear that Barham had more than
this. What, indeed, makes him perfect and
absolute master of his craft, is his power of
invariably catching the whimsical aspects,
the humorous sides, of an event. Hood was
too fond of a pun, Praed was too fine a
gentleman, Browning is too subtle and curious,
to attain the precise humour of Ingoldsby.
Wherever we open the 'Legends'
we find the frolicsome fancy of their author
fresh and facile. Take the description of
Winifred and David Pryce, in 'Look at the
Clock!' It is a picture easily realized in the
Principality:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>'Winifred Pryce was tidy and clean,</p>
<p>Her gown was a flowered one, her petticoat green,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span></p>
<p>Her buckles were bright as her milking cans,</p>
<p>And her hat was a beaver, and made like a man's;</p>
<p>Her little red eyes were deep set in their socket-holes,</p>
<p>Her gown-tail was turned up, and tucked through the pocket holes:</p>
<p class="i3">A face like a ferret</p>
<p class="i3">Betokened her spirit:</p>
<p>To conclude, Mrs. Pryce was not over young,</p>
<p>Had very short legs, and a very long tongue.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i3">Now David Pryce</p>
<p class="i3">Had one darling vice;</p>
<p>Remarkably partial to anything nice,</p>
<p>Nought that was good to him came amiss,</p>
<p>Whether to eat, or to drink, or to kiss!</p>
<p class="i3">Especially ale&mdash;</p>
<p class="i3">If it was not too stale</p>
<p>I really believe he'd have emptied a pail;</p>
<p class="i3">Not that in Wales</p>
<p class="i3">They talk of their ales;</p>
<p>To pronounce the word they make use of might trouble you,</p>
<p>Being spelt with a C, two R's and a W.'</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now in this there is absolutely nothing that
will bear analysis; it is the laughing spirit
of the man that carries you on, amusing
you in spite of yourself, in spite of your decided
feeling that really there is nothing to
laugh at. But, somehow, what with the
ready jingle of the rhyme, and the perfect
good humour of the ridicule, amused you
are.</p>

<p>Barham's loudest fun was generated when
he had to deal with obsolete and obsolescent
superstitions. He loved to laugh at the
vulgar idea of the Devil&mdash;the fiend with
horns, tail, and hoofs, whom Cuvier ruthlessly
dismissed as 'a graminivorous animal.'
Thus, in the 'Lay of Saint Cuthbert,' we
find him describing a group of demons at
dinner:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i3">'Few ate more hearty</p>
<p class="i3">Than Madame Astarte,</p>
<p>And Hecate, considered the belles of the party.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Between them was seated Leviathan, eager</p>
<p>To do the polite, and take wine with Belphegor:</p>
<p>Here was Morbleu (a French devil) supping soup-meagre,</p>
<p>And there, munching leeks, Davy Jones of Tredegar&mdash;</p>
</div>
<hr class="l30" />
<div class="stanza">
<p>Here's Lucifer lying blind drunk with Scotch ale,</p>
<p>While Beelzebub's tying huge knots in his tail'&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>and so on <i>ad libitum</i>. Again, in the 'Lay
of Saint Abelard,' he gives us 'Old Nick'
defeated by a saintly personage. It was&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>'In good King Dagobert's palmy days,</p>
<p class="i1">When saints were many and sins were few,</p>
<p class="i3">Old Nick, 'tis said,</p>

<p class="i1">One evening&mdash;and could not tell what to do.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>He had been east and he had been west,</p>
<p class="i1">And far had he journeyed o'er land and sea;</p>
<p class="i3">For women and men</p>

<p>And he could not catch one where he'd now catch three.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>He had been north and he had been south,</p>
<p class="i1">From Zembla's shores unto fair Peru,</p>
<p class="i3">Ere he filled the sack</p>
<p class="i3">Which he bore on his back&mdash;</p>
<p class="i1">Saints were so many and sins so few.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>The way was long, and the day was hot;</p>
<p class="i1">His wings were weary; his hoofs were sore;</p>
<p class="i3">And scarce could he trail</p>
<p class="i3">His nerveless tail</p>
<p class="i1">As it furrowed the sand on the Red Seashore.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>The day had been hot, and the way was long;</p>
<p class="i1">Hoof-sore, and weary, and faint, was he;</p>
<p class="i3">He lowered his sack,</p>
<p class="i3">And the heat of his back.</p>
<p class="i1">As he leaned on a palm-tree, blasted the tree.'</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Demons and saints were the favourite themes
of Tom Ingoldsby's laughter; he jeered alike
the Romish miracle-monger and the anthropomorphic
fiend. A volume might be
written on the way in which the popular and
vulgar idea of the devil has gradually arisen.
It is clear from 'Paradise Lost,' that Milton
favored the medi&aelig;val notion that the Pagan
divinities were really fiends; and it can
scarcely be doubted that the hirsute Pan gave
the first sitting for that portrait of the devil
which Coleridge completed, when he wrote</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'His coat was red, and his breeches were blue,</p>
<p>With a hole behind for his tail to come through.'</p>
</div>

<p>At such matters we can smile contemptuously;
but in earlier centuries, when the
Pagan superstition had still some vitality left
in it, it was a serious matter to the Christian
convert. Pan might meet him at the corner of
a lonely woodland, and strike him with a panic
dread. Worse than all he might be allured
by the terrible enticements of Venus. To
this day, Friday has a tradition of ill-luck,
because it is <i>dies veneris&mdash;vendredi</i>. That
the goddess of evil pleasure still came among
men as a female fiend was a firm belief of the
Middle Ages. Hence have we the legend of
the Venusberg, chosen as a theme by more
than one living poet, the version we prefer
being unquestionably Lord Houghton's;
hence also that of the betrothal ring inadvertently
placed by a bridegroom on the
finger of a statue of Venus, which finger, on
his return, he finds bent, and the ring irremovable.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
This latter story is told with prosaic
prolixity in the final volume of Mr.
Morris's 'Earthly Paradise.' It must be remembered
that the change from Paganism to
Christianity was often effected in curious
ways; that the worship of Apollo, the sun-god,
was, by a play upon words, diverted to
Elias the prophet; that temples of Venus
were, as a rule, dedicated to the Virgin.
Probably that worship of the Virgin Mary to
which Romanists cling so fondly originated
in a weak desire to satisfy proselytes by giving
them one goddess in exchange for another.
Any way, the belief in Venus endured
so long that, in 1614, in the good city of
Frankfort, a learned lawyer named Kornman,
published a work called 'Mons Veneris,'
which dealt with the legends about her as if
they were based on fact. Of such legends
let us name one only; an English story, told
by William of Newbury. In the reign of
Henry I., a peasant passed at midnight, near
a hill, not far from the town of Burlington.
To his amazement, he heard sounds of revelry
therefrom, and saw a door open in the hillside,
and, entering, beheld a vast chamber,
where men and women held high festival. A
cup was handed him, full of some liquid,
which doubtless would have the effect of
Circe's magic wine: with singular presence
of mind, our peasant threw away the wine,
and ran off with the cup. All the rabble
rout of Venus pursued him, but the swift-footed
ploughman brought his prize safely to
Burlington. Somebody (probably the mayor,
who should have been knighted for it) sent
the cup to the King, and the King made it a
present to the Queen of King David of Scotland;
but King William of Scotland returned
it to Henry II. of England. Whether it is
still among the royal plate is a point to be
determined by 'Notes and Queries.'</p>

<p>The growth of letters and of science
changes all this; just as Venus vanished a few
centuries ago, Old Bogy also&mdash;the foe of our
infancy&mdash;has vanished from modern nurseries,
nor do very many children of elder growth
believe in an archdemon of the graminivorous
type. Hence the fun of 'Ingoldsby' that
ridiculed superstition of this sort is likely to
lose its interest in time. We fear, however,
that his laughing caricature of Romish absurdities&mdash;as
in 'The Jackdaw of Rheims'&mdash;will
scarcely lose its point at present. The
Pope may be reduced to 'the Vatican, and a
garden,' but the Papal superstition still clings
closely to multitudes of men, especially of
the Celtic race. That race, as M. John Lemoinne
has just said of his French kindred,
is feminine, and seems unable to accept a
manly religion.</p>

<p>The 'Ingoldsby Legends' are peculiarly
adapted to the palate of youth. They make
fun out of trifles and vulgarities. One can
hardly understand a man of high culture caring
much about them after forty. Then the
humour of Shakspeare's clowns, of Cervantes,
and Sterne, and Elia, becomes more enjoyable
than the 'Ingoldsby Legends' or the
'Pickwick Papers.' Then you prefer Autolycus
to Sam Weller. The strong point of
Ingoldsby is his gay high-spirited boyishness;
but this quality is only attractive under certain
conditions. It may, perhaps, be roughly
stated that a man will care to read Ingoldsby
so long as he cares to play cricket.
It is, in fact, the eager buoyancy and rather
perspiring fun of the cricket-field which one
finds in the rollicking strophes of the 'Legends.'
When their writer knocks over a
saint or a demon as if he were a wicket, you
almost expect to hear the shout of, 'How's
that, umpire?' Indeed, the book is a <i>loud</i>
book, scarcely to be tolerated, one might
think, in a quiet library. Yet was its author
a quiet haunter of libraries, and we find in
one of his letters how he received in one a
royal visitor:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'What think you of a visit from, and confabulation
with, the Queen of the Belgians. On
Saturday, I was in the library at St. Paul's, my
custom always in an afternoon, with a book-binder's
'prentice and a printer's devil, looking
out fifty dilapidated folios for rebinding. I had
on a coat which, from a foolish prejudice in the
multitude against patched elbows, I wear nowhere
else, my hands and face encrusted with
the dust of years, and wanting only the shovel&mdash;I
had the brush&mdash;to sit for the portrait of a
respectable master chimney sweeper, when the
door opened, and in walked the Cap of Maintenance,
bearing the sword of, and followed by,
the Lord Mayor in full fig, with the prettiest
and liveliest little Frenchwoman leaning on his
arm. Nobody could get at the lions but myself.
I was fairly in for it, and was thus presented
in the most <i>recherch&eacute;</i>, if not the most
expensive, court-dress that I will venture to
say the eyes of royalty were ever greeted
withal. <i>Heureusement pour moi</i>, she spoke
excellent English, however, and rattled on with
a succession of questions which I answered as
best I might. They were sensible, however,
showed some acquaintance with literature, and
a very good knowledge of dates.'

<p>Her lively Majesty might have been felicitated
on finding Tom Ingoldsby as a guide
to the library of the great cathedral. But to
return to the 'Legends.' Besides their extreme
boyishness, their redundancy of pulsation,
there is a deficiency in them which
must prevent their becoming classic. They
are devoid of poetry. Master of the grotesque
as he was, Barham had no mastery of
the picturesque. Keen to see and seize the
humorous aspects of affairs, he had none of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
that deeper humour which creates character.
A real poet who had written some fifty or
more eccentric legends, could not have helped
inventing or describing certain individual
characters in the course of his work. He
must have done it unconsciously, must have
done it if even he had tried to avoid it.
There are two tests on the very surface of
the true poet. If he describes a scene, you
see it; if he describes a man, you know him.
Barham's grotesque descriptions are often remarkable;
indeed, his legends somewhat remind
us of the hideous gurgoyles of old
churches, wherein tradition sayeth the old
ecclesiastic architects depicted their enemies,
making of them waterspouts, that during
rain they might seem to vomit. The men
who carved those gurgoyles could not have
sculptured an Apollo; and of Barham it may
be said that, though he wrote laughable
stories with supreme felicity, he never produced
a line of poetry. He appears, indeed,
to have regarded only the surface of life.
There is nothing in his published works to
show that he had an original idea, or that
he cared about ideas. Of course, having
given us the 'Ingoldsby Legends'&mdash;a piece
of work absolutely unique, and quite unlikely
to meet with a readable rival&mdash;he will
be forgiven if he had a contempt for ideas;
but one feels some desire to know whether
such fertility of fun was not the upper stratum
of something stronger and finer. Tom
Hood's fun, for example, grows out of his
profound melancholy, as under Etna's laughing
vines the volcanic fire is sleeping. Shakspeare's
fun grows out of his masterful knowledge
of the world, of men, of women. In
a play of his you seem in some city of chivalry
and romance, where the great knight
passes to deeds of high emprise, and the
lovely lady smiles on him from her balcony,
and the troubadour sings of 'the Lord of Oc
and No;' and all the while you hear the
chaffer of the market-place, the chatter of
street gossips, the insignificant laughter of
loitering louts. Fun that has no root in
something deeper seems morbid and hysterical;
and we cannot help believing that there
was more in Barham than his writings reveal,
than his most intimate friends knew,
than perhaps he knew or even guessed himself.</p>

<p>Dr. Maginn, a man like yet unlike Tom
Ingoldsby, wrote these four lines&mdash;part of a
poem which we have no means of obtaining:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'For those who read aright are well aware</p>
<p class="i1">That Falstaff, revelling his rough mates between,</p>
<p>Oft in his heart felt less the load of care,</p>
<p class="i1">Than Jaques, sighing in the forest green.'</p>
</div>

<p>Maginn had, if we may judge from appearances,
higher poetic instincts than Barham;
his 'Homeric Ballads' are a very remarkable
contribution to the literature of Homeric
translation; but he unwisely expended himself
upon periodical writing, and has left
nothing behind him worthy of his powers.
It is, we think, a subject for congratulation,
that the cheap magazines of the day are so
anxious to please the populace, that a first-rate
writer has absolutely no chance with
them, and is obliged to do work worthier of
him. The shilling magazine has to suit the
taste of the railway reader, who wants to be
amused during the hour in which Great
Western or Great Northern accepts him as
a parcel to be delivered at a friend's house
by dinner-time. How this is done we need
not say, as anybody who likes to expend a
shilling can judge for himself; but it is so
done as to render it absurd for men of the
calibre of Barham and Maginn to write for
the majority of these magazines. This we
take to be an advantage. Such men are obliged
to work harder&mdash;and better.</p>

<p>Another instance of a man with something
nobler in him and better than he ever
gave the world, or even his friends, is Theodore
Hook. Until his private diary came
into the hands of those who knew him best,
they had no knowledge of the depths of
passionate remorse for a wasted life which
lay beneath the too brilliant surface of his
character. 'In every page,' wrote Lockhart,</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'We trace the disastrous influence of both
the grand original errors perpetually crossing
and blackening the picture of superficial gaiety&mdash;indications,
not to be mistaken, of a conscience
ill at ease; of painful recollections and
dark anticipations rising irrepressibly, not to
be commanded down; of good, gentle, generous
feelings, converted by stings and dartings
of remorse into agonies of torture. If we were
to choose a motto for this long line of volumes,
it would be a maxim so familiar to himself,
that it is repeated over and over in his tales of
fiction&mdash;hardly omitted in any one of them&mdash;"Wrong
never comes right."'
</p>
</div>

<p>Theodore Hook laboured under the double
disadvantage of an irremovable load of debt,
and of an illicit connection which effectually
prevented his marrying a woman who might
have directed his marvellous powers into
their true channel. The consequence was
that he lived a false factitious life; worked
terribly hard to produce income necessary
for him to meet wealthy peers on apparently
equal terms; was always pestered by money-lenders;
yet all the while his daring spirit
maintained an external gaiety unquenchable.
At the very time when his spirit seemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
highest, when his wit was memorably brilliant,
when at club or country house he was
amazing every one by his victorious vivacity,
there occur in his diary entries that show a
broken spirit, a wounded heart, an infinite
regret for the past and despair of the future.
Such was the inner condition of a man
whose conversation had such unique sparkle,
that men dined at the Athen&aelig;um for the
chance of being allowed to draw their chairs
to his little table in a favourite corner (Temperance
Corner) after dinner&mdash;so that the
diners at that club fell off more than 300 a
year after his disappearance from his wonted
seat.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that the early career of
men of letters is often turned awry by the
well-meant interference of their relations.
A boy of genius, who happens to appear in
the midst of a steady, stolid, respectable family,
is usually regarded as a 'black sheep.'
They try to make him work in some regular
groove, and, of course, he fails. If they are
very determined, he quarrels with them,
and then, too often, he runs headlong into
debt, or love, or both, and burdens himself
in such a way that he has to toil for freedom
through the best years of his life, and
possibly never emancipates himself. Of
course, it is always hard to say whether the
young gentleman is right who fancies himself
a genius. Dr. Holmes, in his latest
novel, has a capital sketch of a young poetaster
who 'eventuates' behind the counter
of a store. Such youths require Darwinian
compression; but there are just a few of
higher mould, with the irrepressible vocation
for pen and ink which nothing can cure,
who would do better if some way could be
devised to give them a chance in literature.
Perhaps when the school boards have leisure
to consider the subject, they will try to discover
a way of developing those latent
powers, mathematical as well as poetical,
which often exist in regions wholly unexpected.
Inspectors of schools might be
directed, after they have registered the triumphs
of the clever boys, to investigate the
habits of the stupid ones. A great poet or
mathematician is almost certain to seem
stupid in his boyhood.</p>

<p>It may appear that we have tried the 'Ingoldsby
Legends' by too high a test; and,
indeed, it is a very unpretentious production.
Its originator was wholly modest, and did
not dream of placing himself in the foremost
seats of the literary amphitheatre. He
knew the true value of his invention. It is
designed for those who would rather laugh
than think. It may amuse children at any
rate, and there are certain fortunate folk
who, to the end of their lives, can be children
now and then&mdash;can listen to merry
rhyming, can believe for the moment that in
Fairyland there are mock turtles and March
hares, that the dogs there have no ears because
the dog's ears have been used up on
the little boys' Latin grammars, and the
sheep no eyes because the little girls have
used up all their sheep's eyes in looking at
their sweethearts; can imagine that in
Ghostland one may dine comfortably with
one's doppelganger. There are times&mdash;'weird
winter nights,' as Shelley calls them,
warmed with merriment, and joyous summer
days in which the nightingale seems ebrious
with ozone&mdash;when there is a necessity for
nonsense of one sort or another. It is this
necessity which Ingoldsby and his followers
supply. Possibly some good is effected by
the fact that the occupants of lofty positions
have deigned to play with these toys; that
the occupants of deaneries and canonries
(ecclesiastic port-wineries, if we may venture
to coin a phrase) have found in such matters
Attic salt for their filberts.</p>

<p><i>Apropos</i> of Ghostland, just named, Barham
was a great lover of spectral stories,
and the reader who cares about such will
find in his memoir some of the best we have
ever seen. As to anecdotes, the book is
brimming over with them. Of course, one
meets with one or two that have been met
before; but an old story, like an old friend
or an old coat, is sometimes more enjoyable
than a new one. Barham was at Paul's
School with some men as well known as
himself, among them being Sir Frederick
Pollock, Nestor of lawyers, and Richard
Bentley, Nestor of publishers. Another of
his comrades was Charles Diggle, afterwards
Governor of Sandhurst College. Of him
and Barham we find a good story:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'The two boys having in the course of one
of their walks discovered a Quaker's meeting-house,
forthwith procured a penny tart of a
neighbouring pastry-cook; furnished with
this, Diggle marched boldly into the building,
and holding up the delicacy in the midst of the
grave assembly said, with perfect solemnity,</p>

<p>'"Whoever speaks first shall have this pie."</p>

<p>'"Friend, go thy way," commenced a drab-coloured
gentleman, rising; "go thy way,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>'"The pie's yours, sir!" exclaimed Master
Diggle, politely; and placing it before the
astounded speaker, hastily made his escape.'
</p>
</div>

<p>It was very improper, certainly; and we
cannot help hoping that the Head Master of
Dean Colet's famous school heard of the
impertinence, and administered to the
'nether-urchin' of the future military pedagogue
the sharp flogging which he undoubtedly
deserved. But one cannot help laughing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
at these schoolboy absurdities; and the
naughtiest boys, if looked after by a schoolmaster
like Tom Hood's,</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'Who never spoilt the child and spared the rod,</p>
<p>But spoilt the rod and never spared the child,'</p>
</div>

<p>often turn out the ablest men. There is incipient
power in these wayward vivacities of
youth.</p>

<p>Musical amateurs of the present day of
the strenuous class that elicited Charles
Lamb's verses beginning&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'Some cry up Haydn, some Mozart,</p>
<p>Just as the whim bites; for my part</p>
<p>I do not care a farthing candle</p>
<p>For either of them, or for Handel'</p>
</div>

<p>will doubtless deem Lord North an utter
barbarian. George III. scolded him for
never going to the concerts of ancient music.
'Your brother, the Bishop,' said the King,
'never misses them, my Lord.' 'Sir,' answered
the Premier, 'if I were as deaf as my
brother, the Bishop, I would never miss
them either!'</p>

<p>Of Lord Thurlow we believe it was that
Theodore Hook declared that nobody could
be as wise as Thurlow <i>looked</i>. Whether he
had much wisdom is a moot point; but
strength of will he possessed in an enviable
degree, as the following anecdote shows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'Lord Thurlow had applied to George the
Third on behalf of his brother for the Bishopric
of Durham, and having somewhat unexpectedly
met with a refusal, he bowed, and
was about to retire without pressing his suit,
when the monarch, wishing to soften his decision
as far as possible, added, "Anything
else I shall be happy to bestow upon your relative,
but this, unfortunately, is a dignity
never held but by a man of high rank and
family."</p>

<p>'"Then, Sire," returned Lord Thurlow,
drawing himself up, "I must persist in my request&mdash;I
ask it for the brother of the Lord
High Chancellor of England!"</p>

<p>The Chancellor was firm, and the King was
compelled to yield.'
</p>
</div>

<p>This we take to have been highly creditable
to Thurlow: it was a courageous assertion
that the aristocracy of genius is at
least equal to the aristocracy of birth. Here
is an amusing story of clerical ignorance
from Barham's diary:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'December 3.&mdash;Dined for the first time with
Dr. Sumner, Bishop of Llandaff, who told me,
as a fact, that Dr. R&mdash;&mdash;, a fellow of Eton,
had some time since ordered one of his ponds
to be cleared out. A great number of carp,
tench, eels, &amp;c., were taken in the course of the
operation. The doctor was at dinner with some
friends, who had been viewing the work, when
a servant came in, to inform him that in draining
off the water the men had found a chalybeate.
"Have they indeed?" cried he, with
much interest; "I am very glad to hear it.
Tell them to put it along with the other fish
for the present."'
</p>
</div>

<p>In those days Eton was not famous for its
erudition, and a fellow of that famous corporation
was likely to be a better judge of
the 'other fish' than of the chalybeate. Dr.
R&mdash;&mdash; would probably have known exactly
the right way to dress a red mullet from the
Avon or a Coniston char.</p>

<p>Here is a good story of Dr. Thomas
Hume, an intimate friend of Barham's:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'They had walked together to the office of
one of the morning newspapers, and there the
doctor silently placed upon the counter an announcement
of the death of some friend, together
with five shillings, the usual charge for
the insertion of such advertisements. The
clerk glanced at the paper, tossed it on one
side, and said gruffly, "Seven and six!"</p>

<p>'"I have frequently," replied Hume, "had
occasion to publish these simple notices, and I
have never before been charged more than five
shillings."</p>

<p>'"Simple!" repeated the clerk, without
looking up; "He's universally beloved, and
deeply regretted! Seven and six."</p>

<p>'Hume produced the additional half crown,
and laid it deliberately by the others, observing,
as he did so, with the same solemnity of
tone he had used throughout, "Congratulate
yourself, sir, that this is an expense which
your executors will never be put to."'
</p>
</div>

<p>We hope that unlucky clerk could understand
the rebuke that he received; but to
us it appears that sarcasm is generally thrown
away on such people. They are pachyderms.</p>

<p>The book contains some capital stories of
poor Theodore Hook, that marvellously
wasted intellect. His great power lay in
<i>impromptu</i>, of prose or verse, spoken or
written. No man has ever equalled him at
a paragraph or a squib, except as to the latter,
Garrick and Coleridge. Nobody was
ever so exquisite a conversational wit. And
certainly no one has ever possessed his power
of improvisation in English. He threw off
stanza and strophe as fast as a knifegrinder's
wheel throws sparks. He scintillated always.
Coleridge, after an evening in his company,
declared he was as great a genius as Dante.
His felicity was invariable. When he was
improvising at the piano, after luncheon, at
his Fulham villa, enter the ancilla, to say Mr.
Winter, the tax collector, has called. Ejaculates
Hook:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'Here comes Mr. Winter, collector of taxes;</p>
<p>I advise you to give him whatever he axes!</p>
<p>He isn't the man to stand nonsense or flummery.</p>
<p>For though his name's Winter, his actions are summary.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span></p>
</div>

<p>But how could Hook stand the tremendous
dissipation to which he foolishly condescended?
Here is a specimen of his way
of living:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'After a dinner given by Mr. Stephen Price,
of Drury-lane Theatre, all the guests, with the
exception of Cannon and Theodore Hook,
having long since retired, the host, who was
suffering from an incipient attack of gout, was
compelled to allude pretty plainly to the lateness
of the hour. No notice, however, was
taken of the hint; and, unable to endure any
longer the pain of sitting up, Mr. Price made
some excuse, and slipped quietly off to bed.
On the following morning he inquired of his
servant&mdash;"Pray at what time did those gentlemen
go last night?" "Go, sir!" replied John;
"they are not gone, sir; they have just rung
for coffee!"'
</p>
</div>

<p>To revert from anecdotes of this class to
the special theme of our article. Poetry is
one thing, and verse-writing is another, and
there may be very good verse-writers who
would not condescend to be poetasters. In
the present day there are a multitude of
foolish persons who have discovered that
<i>breeze</i> rhymes with <i>trees</i>, and that there are as
many syllables as they have fingers in a line
of blank verse. So they flood the shilling
magazines with their silliness, and some of
them raise money enough to pay for the publication
of a volume of their trash. Within
a few days from this time of writing we
have had occasion to look through about a
score volumes of this class, and only one
contained anything that could be called
poetry&mdash;and that one came from San Francisco.
Now, why cannot people with a faculty
for verse write it sensibly, without
trying to be poets? Why can they not
give us something manly, something humorous?
Lockhart and Maginn wrote fine
verse, but would have smiled at the notion
of being called poets. Barham never wrote
a line of poetry, in the severe sense&mdash;but
what immense amusement has the world
received from the rhymed stories of Ingoldsby!</p>

<p class="p2">Imperialism has fallen; and with it France
has for the present disappeared from among
the great Powers. With Metz in foreign
hands, she is much in the same position as
that of Paris when the Prussians had turned
upon her the guns of Mont Val&eacute;rien. Her
eastern frontier is wholly exposed; she must
feel as Lombardy did while Austria held the
Quadrilateral.</p>

<p>As far as material influence is concerned,
France is become a second-rate state. She
must confine her aim to doing what she has
so often done before&mdash;influencing the world
of ideas. She did this in the Middle Ages
in a way which we seldom sufficiently appreciate;
she did it in a less degree during the
post-Reformation period, for then her own
religious wars and the preponderance of
Germany had thrown her somewhat into the
shade; she did it most of all when the <i>Encyclop&eacute;distes</i>
began to claim for her a definite
position as the world's teacher. This
position she had not formally claimed before.
Under the old <i>r&eacute;gime</i> she had been slowly
getting welded together; feudalism, carried
out more 'logically' in France than
elsewhere, had kept her provinces almost as
distinct as so many little German kingdoms.
Louis XI.'s policy, indeed, did for the French
<i>noblesse</i> much what the Wars of the Roses
did for ours; and Louis XIV., by giving
the higher classes a taste for Court life, drew
them together and trained them to a community
of habits and aims; but the mass of
provincials were scarcely affected by this
centralization of a single class. Louis XIV.,
however, did one thing more: he secured to
Paris that fatal predominance which has
ever since made her the arbitress of the
national destinies. While saying '<i>l'&eacute;tat</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
<i>c'est moi,</i>' he so arranged that very soon
the Parisians could say, <i>Paris c'est la France</i>.
The great writers, too, lent their influence
to glorify the capital: the town-loving spirit
was strong in them all. Paris got more and
more supreme, while at the same time the
efforts of Government were divided between
crushing out provincial independence and
meeting the ruinous expenditure of a Court
always luxurious and very often warlike.
Hence a tendency in the old <i>r&eacute;gime</i> to a
more and more strictly personal government.
Feudal liberties were crushed; feudal tyranny
was aggravated. The provincial parliaments,
and that of Paris into the bargain, gradually
lost even the semblance of power; and the
old system degenerated into despotism.</p>

<p>The Revolution, while superficially breaking
up this system, left untouched those
parts of it which some say are grounded on
the peculiarities of French character. It intensified
centralization, and it practised
most oppressively that interference with the
rights of the individual which is of the essence
of personal government. The very
men who so loudly proclaimed the principles
of '89 were found most ready to act on
rules which led them straight to the lawless
tyranny of the Terror. Their 'ideas' were
grand, but personal freedom was far too
trifling a thing to be allowed to stand in
their way for a moment. In one point the
Revolution diverged from the old <i>r&eacute;gime</i>:
it became intensely and deliberately propagandist&mdash;bent,
<i>i.e.</i>, on carrying forward,
with the strength of the whole nation, the
mission which the thinkers of Voltaire's day
had assigned to themselves. We often find
that the man who believes in nothing in
particular is the most violent in opposing
the beliefs of others. So it was with the
leaders of the Revolution: they were mad
to spread their doctrines over Europe; and
their doctrines being those of Paris, Paris
became (in Frenchmen's eyes) the recognized
head, not of France only, but of the
civilized world.</p>

<p>Imperialism was at first a reaction from
despotic anarchy; the dread of another Terror
made the French welcome with delight a
man who seemed strong enough to be 'the
saviour of society.' So it was again in 1849,
when the Socialist struggle in which 13,000
Parisians perished so alarmed the successful
'bourgeois,' that to prevent its repetition
they condoned the <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>. Ideas, it
was said in 1795, were ruining France; the
men of ideas had been beaten in the field;
Imperialism therefore meant military glory
as the basis of French prosperity. Frenchmen
were content to believe that (as M.
Louis Blanc said the other day at Bordeaux)
'glory and liberty are incompatible,' and
deliberately to choose the former.</p>

<p>Of course the Imperialism of 1852 differs
somewhat from that of 1804, but it is the
same in its intense selfishness, and its thorough
insincerity. Under the second Empire,
there have been commercial treaties and
alliances, and the working class has found
good wages, so long as it has been content
with political nothingness; but the two will
be seen to be the same in principle. Each
has the radical evil of depending on success
in war, or peace, or both, for its stability;
and this necessary instability makes them
more hopeless as systems than the old
<i>r&eacute;gime</i>, with all its corruptness, or even than
the wild theories of the Republic.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>But it is needless to enlarge on the manifest
causes which made a hereditary monarchy
stable so long as it is not wholly intolerable.
The same causes make the best of
'tyrannies' (in the Greek sense of the word)
unstable. Men as 'logical' as Frenchmen
are sure to feel that if such a government is
not fulfilling the purpose of its creation, it
had better cease to exist; and feeling with
Frenchmen generally means action.</p>

<p>The first Napoleon had immense success on
his side; he 'saved France,' in his own
fashion, and so long as he was successful,
very few Frenchmen cared to inquire into
the soundness of the method employed. The
third Napoleon had in his favour the remembrance
of his uncle's success, and the fact
that the <i>r&egrave;gne du bavardage</i> had failed as
completely in 1849 as it had done in the days
of the Directory. Both were helped, too, by
the systematic lying of their newspapers,
which, amid the enforced silence of all who
would not speak as they did, could say what
they pleased without fear of contradiction.
Both, too, were able administrators: Louis
points out, in 'his own Account of the Fight
at Dame Europa's School'&mdash;a bitter satire on
the selfish insincerity of Imperialism&mdash;how
hard he worked for years, and how by
repressing them with one hand and giving
them employment with the other, he controlled
the terrible Paris <i>canaille</i>. This is,
in fact, his solitary claim for forgiveness.
But both fell when the moment of pressure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
came, and the fall of the nephew is irreparable:
for him there can be no 'hundred
days;' even the boundless capabilities of
treachery which he found in Bazaine failed
to do anything but seal his fate by convincing
France that, whereas the uncle shed
French blood like water in support of his
selfish ambition, the nephew actually paltered
with the enemy, and betrayed the strongest
fortress in the country, in the vain hope
of securing foreign support.</p>

<p>It is plain to the most superficial observer
that of all the things which have collapsed
in France since last July, none has collapsed
so hopelessly as Imperialism. When the ex-Emperor
rushed into war as the only way of
staving off a revolution, France showed herself
(as she so often has done at critical periods
of her history) culpably passive. There
were complaisant prefects who assured his
Majesty that his people went with him heart
and soul; there were crowds, hired or not,
such as can always be collected in any great
city, who shouted <i>Vive la guerre</i> and <i>&agrave; Berlin</i>;
but the peasantry still believed that the
Empire meant peace; and when they afterwards
found war come upon them, they fancied
(so strong was their faith in Napoleon)
that it was the Prussians who were the aggressors.
Just in the same way on the eve
of the Spanish war, in 1808, the servile Senate
said: 'Sire, the will of the French people
goes along with you. This Spanish war
is just and necessary. Fathers envy their
sons the glory of rushing to join your ranks,
and of winning another Marengo and another
Austerlitz.' And this farce was kept up at
a time when the conscription had grown so
odious that the Government had to imitate
Louis XIV.'s <i>dragonnades</i>, and to quarter
<i>garnisaires</i> upon the families of those lads
who had escaped to the woods, or had fled
across the frontier.</p>

<p>France was passive in July, 1870, as she
was more than once during the first Napoleon's
career; the difference is, that the
nephew's army, on which he was supposed to
have lavished so much thought and money,
and which, since the <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>, he had
pampered into pr&aelig;torian insolence, failed
him utterly both for defence and offence;
whereas the uncle always had something
which he could trust to fight well, if not to
win battles.</p>

<p>Since Sedan, France, no longer passive, has
worked wonders; and every step in her work
has made a relapse to the old state of things
more impossible. 'The man of Sedan,' it
was felt all along, could never return, except
behind Prussian bayonets. Had he, on that
last fatal day, cut his way at whatever loss
through the encompassing host, and, throwing
himself on Paris, raised a <i>lev&eacute;e en masse</i>
to the old cry of 'the country in danger,'
matters might have turned out very differently,
both for him and for France; but he
could not have so acted without denying his
own principles. His whole career had been
an attempt to juggle with universal suffrage
while practising the narrowest despotism,
and now to appeal in real earnest to popular
principles, and to give the pledges necessary
to make that appeal a serious one, was an
impossibility for the man who had eagerly
snatched at the chances of war which the
crafty Bismarck threw in his way, rather
than honestly carry out the liberal measures
which he had at last been forced to adopt.
There is a point beyond which charlatanism
cannot go. Thrice had the uncle felt that
this kind of appeal is useless when it is contrary
to a man's whole antecedents: once at
Arcis-sur-Aube, when in the midst of the
battle, Sebastiani said, 'Are these all your
Majesty's forces?' 'Every man I have.'
'Then does not your Majesty think of raising
the nation?' 'Nonsense: you're dreaming
of the way they did things in Spain, or here
in France, in '91. How can you talk of
raising a nation whose nobles and priests
have been destroyed by the Revolution, and
whose Revolution has been destroyed by me?'
There was nothing, he felt, left to appeal to.
Again, on his return from Elba, wisdom said,
'Wait on French soil, and crush the invaders
at Paris and Lyons;' but this would
have necessitated an appeal to the nation and
a pledge that all war except defensive war
should cease, and, as Colonel Charras says,
in words which seem almost prophetical of
the events of last July, 'to re-establish his
despotism he could not do without the
prestige of victory: he thought to find it
on the frontier, so thither he hastened.' A
third time, when, after Waterloo, Napoleon
was among the remnant of his troops at
Laon, it was still free to him to show himself
not only the 'child of the Revolution,' but
its legitimate offspring and its protector. He
still shrank instinctively from doing so:
bolder, indeed, than his nephew, he did go
to Paris; but with the invincible dislike of
all his race to true freedom of government,
he went there merely to see if there was
a chance of carrying on the war without
making any real political concessions.</p>

<p>So it was that, after Sedan, the nephew
passed out of history: no amount of plotting
can restore the man who showed himself fool
as well as knave, who fell&mdash;not, like his uncle,
under the blows of banded Europe&mdash;but
because he had allowed himself to be wholly
deceived, both as to the quality and composition
of his own army and as to the dispositions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
of neighbouring powers. France
never can forgive such a result of twenty
years of personal government. But that the
ex-Emperor should disappear out of history is
natural enough; the marvel is that he ever
became one of the makers of history. His
success was due to the vitality of the Napoleonic
idea, nourished as it was after the restoration
by writers of all kinds&mdash;notably by
the veteran statesman who now, more than
any one else, has made a return to Imperialism
impossible. For this total revolution in
literature it is hard to give a sufficient reason.
Before the restoration, literature, when not
venal, was strongly anti-Bonapartist.'<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> After
the Bourbons were restored, writers began to
extol Napoleon as industriously as before
they had decried him. This change was
owing partly to French feeling against the
mode of his removal: it was a great humiliation;
as Madame de Sta&euml;l said (deploring
the return from Elba), 'It's all over with
liberty if he succeeds, and with the national
independence if he is beaten.' The nation
felt that the peace of 1815 had compromised
its independence; and, in writing down the
king who had been brought in by foreign
armies, literary men were acting as the
mouthpiece of France. But this is not all;
wounded vanity did much. Under the Empire
mind had been powerless, unless, as in the
case of Lac&eacute;p&egrave;de and other <i>savans</i>, it had
submitted to be the humble tool of force:
when Si&egrave;yes said, 'I'll be the head and that
little Corsican shall be the arm,' he had quite
unwittingly spoken the truth; for, in Napoleon's
system, the head was nothing and the
arm everything. Great, then, was the disappointment
when under Louis XVIII., and
still more under his successor, the head
seemed almost as powerless as before. The
heart (if such a word may be used of the
hollow system of Popery) came into play;
and, unless a man was <i>d&eacute;v&ocirc;t</i>, or seemed to be
so, ability of any kind served him little. Add
to this the wilful blindness of the Bourbons,
who (it was soon seen) 'had learnt nothing
and forgotten nothing.' Their petty despotism
disgusted the nation; while the 'Memoirs
of St. Helena' and a crowd of similar writings
made out, with a sophistry so barefaced
that we should fancy it could never
have deceived even Frenchmen, that the Emperor
had always acted as a dutiful son
of the revolution, according to the programme
which himself had laid down, that 'liberty,
equality, and prosperity shall be ensured.'
Will the nephew ever venture to assert,
as the uncle did in 1816, that his government
was a constitutional and temperate monarchy,
and that the French people under it were the
freest people in Europe? However this may
be, there is no doubt that the claim thus
made by Napoleon I. told immensely on the
thought of the nation, and through it on the
masses. Claiming to have saved the revolution
by moderating its violence, the exile of
St. Helena persistently called himself its
soldier and its martyr. His wars (he said)
had been undertaken to spread its civilizing
influence; and the consciousness of this had
made kings and princes so determined on his
overthrow. We, of course, can see through
the hollowness of all this: but the French
writers of that day, finding France humiliated,
and knowing that she had been glorious,
actually came to believe, or at any rate fostered
the belief, that in the days of her glory
she had been free, since undoubtedly in the
days of her humiliation she was fettered.
No wonder the rest were deceived, since
a man of consummate ability, M. Thiers,
whose honesty is proved by his having refused
office during some seventeen years of
'personal government,' could write such a
marvellous romance as that which he gave to
the world under the title of 'The Consulate
and the Empire.'</p>

<p>Thus, by a combination of causes we may
partly account for the change in the mind of
France; and this change told upon the more
or less educated masses. When Thiers wrote
as he did; when Victor Hugo&mdash;whom a
strange Nemesis afterwards urged to write
'Napoleon the Little'&mdash;sang the great man's
praises in 'Lui,' and, throwing moral sanctions
to the winds, declared that</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'Tu domines notre si&eacute;cle, <i>ange ou d&eacute;mon qu'importe</i>?'
</p>
</div>

<p>when Beauch&egrave;sne, in 'L'Ecolier,' pathetically
described the day-dreams of the boyish enthusiast;
and, yet more, when B&eacute;ranger sang
his 'Vieux drapeau,' and his 'Serrez vos
rangs, Gaulois et Francs,' and, above all, his
'Souvenirs du Peuple,' no wonder men forgot
the real Napoleon, and accepted the ideal
which was so persistently put before
them.</p>

<p>B&eacute;ranger was a true prophet when he
sang</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'On parlera de sa gloire</p>
<p>Sous le chaume bien longtemps;</p>
<p>L'humble toit en cinquante ans</p>
<p>Ne conna&icirc;tra plus d'autre histoire.'</p>
</div>

<p>It is not easy to trace how this feeling had
so penetrated downwards, and had so thoroughly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
laid hold of the lowest stratum, the
wholly uneducated peasantry, that the first
time the vote by universal suffrage was taken,
many peasants thought they were voting for
the old Emperor. That it did so is one more
proof how soon a nation with great 'recuperative
powers' loses the memory of disasters.
The cruel conscriptions which drove mere
boys to die in Spain under the fire of Wellington's
seasoned troops&mdash;the retreat from
Russia, after which 'the man of Smorgoni'
was for a time as unpopular as 'the man of
Sedan,' were forgotten. The heroic defence
of Champagne, and the glories which preceded
it, were alone remembered. This will account
for the growth of the Imperial idea in
the more fighting parts of France, especially
in Alsace and Lorraine, which have always
contributed much more than their share to
the army.</p>

<p>How it was in La Vend&eacute;e we cannot pretend
to say. Napoleon there had been as
ruthless in his way as the 'blues;' he had
ordered that every family which could not
prove that all its members were at home and
quiet should lose its property, this being divided
between the 'good subjects' and the
occupying troops. Nor can we understand
how the Southern peasants should have welcomed
the nephew when they had hated the
uncle. It was against them chiefly that the
odious <i>garnisaires</i> had to be employed; and
we all know how they showed their feeling
in 1814 by several times nearly tearing the
Emperor to pieces when he was on the way
to Elba, frightening him so that he disguised
himself as an English officer.</p>

<p>North-eastern France was Bonapartist because
it was anti-Prussian, and the Emperor
had thoroughly humiliated Prussia. For this
special hatred of Prussia there is ample reason.
The Prussian character is not loveable; even at
the best it is singularly domineering and cantankerous;
and during the invasions of
French territory (not to speak of the bloodthirsty
pursuit after Waterloo) the Prussians
had shown themselves (as unhappily they too
often have during this war)<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> worse than Cossacks.
This special hatred of Prussians
comes out continually in the Erckmann-Ch&acirc;trian
series. The contrast between the bitterness
with which the fights at Ligny and
Wavre and the final conflict at Waterloo are
described is remarkable; it may almost be
said to be prophetic of the merciless way in
which too much of the fighting has been carried
on within the past few months. 'No
quarter' is the word on both French and
Prussian side; and scornful hatred lurks in
every phrase of the graphic account of those
savage conflicts which at last left the French
nominally victorious. The English, on the
other hand, are 'jolly fellows, well shaved,
and with the get-up of <i>bons bourgeois</i>.' We
do not think that, even before the Crimean
war, French mothers ever taught their children
to hate us; whereas, <i>mon fils tu ha&iuml;ras
les Prussiens</i> was a daily lesson among the
peasants of the North-east.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>To account for the Napoleonism of the
peasants in other parts, we must add to the
feeling that Napoleon had glorified France,
on the part of those who (we said) were only
too ready to forget how he had also humiliated
and ruined her, the persistent dread of
the <i>spectre rouge</i> on the part of the vast class
of little landowners, and thirdly, the influence
of the priests. Both these had been
made use of by the uncle. Whenever he
wanted an excuse for despotism, he always got
up a Jacobin plot. This was the pretence
for that famous 18th Brumaire, by which
'model and prototype of all <i>coups d'&eacute;tat</i>,' as
M. Barni calls it, he destroyed the constitution
which he had sworn to defend.</p>

<p>When, as First Consul, he arrested a number
of those who remained true to the Republic&mdash;among
them Jourdain, the hero of
Fleurus&mdash;and threatened to banish them to
Cayenne, the pretext was 'the infernal machine'
(very probably 'got up,' like so many
more recent conspiracies), which was denounced
as a Jacobin invention. Jacobinism
was his apology for forming (at the beginning
of the Empire) eight State prisons, and
for exercising the most rigorous censorship
both of the press and of the stage.</p>

<p>How the priests helped him may be judged
from the amusingly profane addresses
made to him on his accession to empire by
the different bishops. The Bishop of Aix
wrote: 'Like another Moses, Napoleon has
been summoned by God from the deserts of
Egypt,' 'God seems to have said (wrote the
Bishop of Orleans), "My heart hath chosen a
new ruler to rule my people; My almighty
arm shall help him in his glorious work, and
I will strengthen his throne. He shall reign
over the seas, and the rivers shall become his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
servants."' In the eyes of other bishops
and capitular bodies the new emperor is 'another
Matthias sent by the Lord,' 'a new Cyrus,'
'Scripture hath given us, in the reign of
Jehoshaphat, a prophetic outline of his reign.'
This, the fitting reward of the Concordat, was
the incense offered up by a servile clergy on
the eve of his coronation; and it matches
well with the <i>Catechism</i>, published by authority,
and in use in all French churches in
1811.<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> After repeated injunctions as to the
special duty of reverence for the Emperor
and his house, the question is asked, 'Are
there not yet other motives to bind us strongly
to our Emperor?'&mdash;'Yes; for it is he
whom God raised up in troublous times to re-establish
the public worship of the holy religion
of our fathers and to be its protector.
He has restored and preserved public order
by his profound and energetic wisdom; he
defends the State by his powerful arm; he is
become the anointed of the Lord by the
consecration which he has received from the
Sovereign Pontiff, chief of the Universal
Church.'<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>How the Pope, of whose meanly cruel
treatment by Napoleon, the Count d'Haussonville
gave such a graphic account in the
<i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i> of two years ago,
really felt on the subject, we need not inquire;
with Napoleon the case was simple enough:
'he wanted a clergy (says Madame de Sta&euml;l)
as he wanted chamberlains and courtiers, and
all the old things over again.' As for his being
the restorer of religion, no praise was
ever less merited; he told Cabanis: 'This
concordat of ours is <i>la vaccine de la religion</i>;
in fifty years it will have killed it out like a
moral small-pox.' On the other hand, before
the Concordat was signed there was full liberty
of worship, and nearly eight millions
of people were in full practice of Catholicism.
His Concordat was needless, except for
his own purposes; at the outset, indeed, the
Assembly had borne heavily on the clergy:
to force them to take oaths and then to persecute
those who refused was to show an ignorance
of the first principles of toleration;
and one of the few things which we have to
find fault with in MM. Erckmann-Ch&acirc;trian's
excellent novels is the way in which the 'refractory
priests' are spoken of, and in which
the harsh treatment they underwent is justified,
because they disturbed the peace of families,
and intrigued for 'royalist restoration.'
But by the Constitution of the year
III. Church and State had been separated,
and freedom of worship restored to every
one. There was no need, therefore, for any
effort on Napoleon's part to secure what the
Constitution had already secured; he was, as
usual, working simply for himself: 'I did
not despair,' (he writes from St. Helena) 'of
sooner or later getting full control of the
Pope; and then what a lever for moving the
world, what a help towards keeping men's
minds in hand!'</p>

<p>With the Pope and the Italian clergy, indeed,
Napoleon never had the least success;
but in France the large salaries which he
gave to the bishops produced the effect he
anticipated; and at last, even in La Vend&eacute;e,
a good deal of the old feeling died out.
The <i>noblesse</i> of course still spoke of him as
a mere <i>locum tenens</i>: for them he was always
'the General Bonaparte, Lieutenant-in-Chief
of the Forces of his Majesty's King
Louis XVII.' But the peasantry were
gradually taught to accept him as the friend
of religion, and not simply as a temporary
police magistrate who was necessary to keep
down their hated enemies the 'Reds.' Of
this his nephew reaped the reward, and he
moreover was able to come forward as the
defender of the Papacy under circumstances
in which his conduct gratified not only the
peasants, but every sincere Romanist in
France, while it caused one more breach in
the already divided Republican camp. If
the occupation of Rome was actually initiated
by honest Republicans, they never (not
even when they made Louis Napoleon
Prince-President) were guilty of a more
fatal mistake. They shared the reward of
all trimmers; supporting 'order' at the expense
of principle, they lost the confidence
of the best men of their party; while the
Prince-President, assuming to be the champion
of that 'order' which after all they
had only defended with half-heartedness,
gained all the credit of the act, and won
thereby the support of the Ultramontanists.
Of this support his subsequent vacillation
could not deprive him, because the Ultramontanes
were sure that, whatever he might
do in other countries, in France he would
not relax those fetters which the Papacy
finds so essential in securing the acceptance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
of its newly 'formulated dogmas and repressive
encyclicals. When we say this, we by
no means assert that the ex-Emperor had
the full confidence of the clergy; that confidence
it is not the policy of Rome to accord
to any one. Now again, as in 1848,
she has shown that on occasion she can be
as revolutionary as Garibaldi himself, if
there is an end to be gained by being so.
Napoleon is lost; despite the ridiculous outcry
of London imperialist papers like <i>La
Situation</i>, his cause is hopeless; therefore
Rome hastens to give him up, and to affirm
that he is rightly punished for having supported
Victor Emmanuel. But, so long as
he was a power in Europe, he received support
enough to keep him popular among
the priest-ridden classes, because he was less
dangerous than those who would be sure to
succeed him. A Republican government
would without doubt have given up the
Roman occupation; while the Orleanists,
who would come to the surface if the Republic
failed, are, as the real friends of religious
liberty, the most unacceptable of all
to the Ultramontane party. Guizot, the Orleanist
statesman <i>par excellence</i>, ventured to
doubt whether it is not an abuse of toleration
to allow full scope to such irreconcilable
foes to liberty as the Jesuits; therefore
it was better to uphold Napoleon, and
to trust to the influence of the Empress
rather than to provoke a change which was
sure to be for the worse.</p>

<p>But we have said enough to account
somewhat for the growth of the Napoleonic
idea, after the first Emperor had done his
best by the failures, and still more by the
littleness of his later years, to crush it.</p>

<p>France, moreover, had been humiliated in
1815, and Louis Philippe kept her at peace
without giving an outlet for enterprise in
foreign colonization. If Algeria had been
less of a mere military settlement; or if, instead
of Algeria, France had laid hold of a
colony better suited for Europeans to thrive
in, the Orleans line might have still been on
the throne. But the nation was slow to
realize the amount of waste which had accompanied
the wars of the Empire. France
did not like to keep quiet and repair the
ugly gaps left in her prosperity; she wanted
to make a grand figure before the world.
Louis Philippe thought that by combined
repression and corruption he could check
this restlessness; and so he, a constitutional
king, was led into a career of unconstitutional
conduct&mdash;the proximate, though not
the remote, cause of the revolution in 1848.</p>

<p>The <i>facilis descensus</i> from a republic to a
despotism was seldom more inevitable than
amid the chaos of parties which succeeded
the Provisional Government. France wanted
<i>prestige</i>: who more likely to give it to
her than the nephew of the man who won
Jena and Austerlitz? France wanted protection
against the 'Reds,' 'the enemies of
order and property:' surely, the very man
to secure this to her was <i>l'homme providentiel</i>,
who could sway the army as one man,
and who, though he professed to believe in
universal suffrage, and to have a high regard
for the working man, was known to
be hand in glove with the great financiers
and capitalists? As Victor Hugo puts it in
his little history of the <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>, 'tous
les hommes du pass&eacute;, depuis tel banquier
juif qui se sentait un peu Catholique jusqu'&agrave;
tel &eacute;v&ecirc;que qui se sentait un peu juif,' all
combined to work up the Napoleonic idea,
and to induce the masses to accept what
was the best government for stock-jobbers
and Court tailors and highly paid functionaries
of all sorts. It was the Nemesis of
1793 which produced the <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> of
December 1851: but for the recollection of
the Reign of Terror, of that wild carnival of
cruelty and rapine, such an outrage would
have been impossible. Men of substance
argued that what had been might be again;
and therefore they threw in their lot with
the saviour of society, even while they abhorred
the means which he employed for
its salvation. National susceptibility, then,
and a half unconscious desire to wipe off
old scores, combined with Popish influence
and the dread of the 'Reds,' helped to give
tangibility to this long-cherished Napoleonic
idea, by bringing about the second Empire.</p>

<p>A few words, now, on the causes and the
history of its decay. These, as usual in
political and social matters, are complex and
seemingly conflicting. First, those who
looked for <i>prestige</i> were not satisfied with
the declaration, <i>l'Empire c'est la paix</i>, even
explained away though it was by the many
wars undertaken in the last twenty years.
France fighting side by side with England in
the Crimea and in China, was not the same
as France carrying her eagles into almost
every European capital. This feeling forced
on the war which resulted in the sudden
peace of Villafranca&mdash;the suddenness of
which peace proved (to the French Emperor's
detractors) that Magenta and Solferino
were not such very decided victories, after
all. It always seemed in Napoleon III.'s
undertakings, that he was stopped at a certain
point, just as if he had not really been
the master of France, but was only free to
use her resources within the range of his
tether. This may be due to the financial
complications in which he and his creatures
were always mixed up, or to that indecision
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
of character which, while it gave him for a
time a reputation for profound wisdom, did
him immense harm by making men suspect
him of deep plotting when he was simply at
a loss how to reconcile conflicting ideas, and
by exciting profound distrust on occasions
where pity would have been the more appropriate
feeling. Herein he paid the penalty
(almost always exacted in all ranks of
life) of seeing both ways. The notion
which couples moral obliquity with crookedness
of vision is confined to the vulgar; but
comparatively few can avoid distrusting the
mental power of looking at once in several
directions. The ex-Emperor had his English
experience; his political education was
far in advance of that of most of his subjects;
he saw the weak points of each
party, and saw too how each drew strength
from the amount of truth which it had
grasped. Could he have lived as president
of a republic in which all these elements
should have had free scope, France might
have thriven morally during the last nineteen
years, as much as she has thriven materially.
But the French character, no less
than his own designs, forbade this. Frenchmen
cannot bear to 'give and take;' their
<i>logique</i> shows itself by forcing them into
the streets to battle for their cause as soon
as there is the feeblest chance of success;
and, above all, his aim was, not to give
France the best government, but to keep
himself by all means at her head. Hence,
lying and repression became his instruments.
One party was played off against another.
The <i>prol&eacute;taires</i> kept in good humour
by the Hausmannizing, not of Paris only, but
of half the French cities, were told that the
Emperor was really their friend; and so
long as they got <i>panem et circenses</i> they
seem pretty generally to have believed it.
The <i>parti pr&ecirc;tre</i> was petted at home; and
the control which the clergy was allowed to
have over education more than compensated
for the cutting off of the Romagna. The
moneyed class, and all the crowd of little
<i>rentiers</i>, who are almost forced to accept
the existing order of things, saw by the vast
growth of public credit and by the steady
price of public securities, that the Empire
was the millennium of men of means. The
army, petted and spoiled, was full of dislike
for civilians, and of chauvinist contempt for
foreigners. The literary class alone feebly
kept up the struggle; and its protest against
the dictum 'la France c'est moi,' was chiefly
confined to such far-fetched allusions as we
find in 'Labi&eacute;nus' and in the 'leaders' of
the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>. The French
are brave; but those who did not accept
the Empire were cowed by the <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>;
and in such circumstances they are of all
people the most patient under what they
have come to believe inevitable.</p>

<p>But though nothing was done much was
felt, and the mistakes and disappointments
of later years soon brought the feeling to
the surface. From the very first, nothing
but the <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> had thoroughly succeeded.
The Crimean war ended too soon; it
failed in its main object, that of crippling
Russia, and it was from the outset distasteful
to a large party because it drew France
so close to England. The Austrian war
wanted the dash and vigour of Marengo; and
the Mexican campaign (so opposed by
Thiers in 1864) showed that the ruler of
France was afraid to move when the United
States bade him stand still. Meanwhile
Poland had been twice given up&mdash;and Poland
is very dear to a large section of the
French; the Confederate States had been
abandoned, and Denmark had been left unhelped
to the tender mercy of Prussia and
Austria. Military <i>prestige</i> had gone, despite
the numbers and the ruinous cost of
the army. All the while the occupation of
Rome was a standing outrage on the feelings
of the most thinking part of the
nation; and, combined with it, by that
strange inconsistency which marks all
Napoleonic procedure, the creation of the
kingdom of Italy alienated the Ultramontanes,
and set them plotting, after their
fashion, against the man whom it was still
their interest outwardly to support.</p>

<p>Herein uncle and nephew are thoroughly
at one. Both Lanfrey and the author of
the 'Romans nationaux' remind us how
constantly the first Napoleon displayed a
cynical disregard for men's feelings, without
apparently seeing that thereby he was giving
irreparable offence. He looked on men
as reasoning machines, and quite left out of
account all the sentimental springs of action.
Those whom he needlessly insulted
would, he thought, recognise both his
power to crush and also to benefit them,
and therefore they would be his obedient
servants. Such was the state of the Continent
that he was scarcely disabused of this
notion till he undertook to govern Spain.
Italy submitted to exactions more galling
though less ruinous than those which the
Germans have been making upon France.
Germany, thoroughly dissatisfied with its
own serene highnesses and arch-dukes, and
looking upon Napoleon as the true successor
of Hoche and Moreau, and the others
who had spread republican ideas through
the Fatherland, was content to bear a great
deal before she showed any signs of anger.
Spain certainly set Continental Europe an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
example in this. Napoleon might prove beyond
dispute that under his tutelage she
would soon rise rapidly in position and
wealth; but Spain had been cruelly outraged
by the treatment to which her people
as well as her royal family had been subjected;
and Spain cared not a jot for either
position or wealth compared with a successful
revolt against French occupation. We
know how wholly, in dealing with individuals,
the uncle left the power of personal
feelings out of account; the nephew, rarely
forgetting this in regard to the individual,
forgot it when dealing with classes. To the
clergy for instance, he said, 'Italy must be
reconstituted, and to that end the Pope
must give up the Romagna and the Marches.
You shall have our troops still in Rome,
and I will arrange that you may control
French education pretty much as you
please.' The clergy, accepting what he
gave, never even pretended to be grateful
for the boon; they never forgave the
'spoliation of the Church;' and thus the
ex-emperor's conduct, as usual, displeased
both parties, and deprived him of any support
except what it was manifestly men's
interest to give him.</p>

<p>Then came the dread of Prussia, and the
sudden attempt (almost as bad as deploying
under fire) to reorganise that army for
which so much money had been drawn
that had really been expended on other objects.
The severer conscription made the
peasants restless; and the <i>pl&eacute;biscite</i> was
called for much in that spirit of distrust
which set David numbering the people.
When it was found that a considerable percentage
of the army had voted the wrong
way, it was felt that the pyramid, hitherto
propped up on its small end by bayonets,
was tottering; and the war, of which we
have lately seen the sad issue, was hurried
on as the sole change of retrieving the fortunes
of the dynasty.</p>

<p>It is not our business to gauge the complicity
of the French people in the affair of
Benedetti and Gramont.<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> France, as we
said, showed herself culpably passive; Paris,
say the French 'irreconcilables,' was culpably
complaisant. We may be thankful that
here in England we have not for centuries
seen twenty years of such a debasing system
as that which made Paris what it was
till it was purified in the furnace of affliction.
We fancy that the reaction against
the despotism of the capital will be very
strong. There is far more independent life
left than most people imagine in the French
provincial cities, far more than in our large
towns; and they were increasingly indignant
at the pre-eminence which the imperial
system gave to Paris in everything. This
exaltation of Paris is natural in a dynasty
which has no roots in France itself. Paris
had proved herself in 1790 capable of taking
the lead and giving the law to all
France; Paris, therefore, must be kept
strong in order that all France might be of
one mind. How different from the days of
Henry IV., or of any of the old race! To
the Corsican intruder the peasant of Beauce
was just the same as the peasant of the
Bourbonnais&mdash;merely a fighting machine.
Hence the real depression of the provinces,
despite of some exceptional improvements
in Brittany and in the <i>landes</i> of the Gironde.
The first Napoleon's levies so reduced
the relative strength of the country districts
that Paris, in his time, gained a position
which she has ever since held. Whatever
form of government she chose the provinces
echoed her choice. Disliking her, they still
never thought of shaking off her yoke. That
Paris, befooled by B&eacute;ranger, by chauvinism,
and by the popular fiction of imperialism,
should have chosen such a President as
she did, is a strange comment on all the
bombastic nonsense which Victor Hugo
talks about <i>Paris-cerveau</i>&mdash;Paris, the brain
of the world. Paris now, conscious of her
degradation, is avenging herself by heaping
all sorts of abuse on the man of her choice&mdash;'the
phlegmatic perjurer,' 'the silent
Tartuffe,' as M. Leclercq calls him. But
the choice was hers, and the degradation
which resulted from the years of personal
rule followed with peculiar rapidity owing
to a want in the French character. The
most 'logical' of nations is indeed terribly
consistent; it always seems to want that
happy power of stopping short before
things have gone so far as to make a catastrophe
inevitable.</p>

<p>The last years of the late emperor's reign
were morally unhealthy beyond the average of
the most immoral times since the Reformation.
It is not that people were worse in
their conduct: they were more cynical.
They had got to laugh at everything, to
despise all sanctions&mdash;even those shadowy
ones which the first revolution substituted
for the sanctions of religion. The years in
which Cora Pearl and the rest of the demi-monde
were the arbiters of fashion, in which
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se was the pet of drawing-rooms, and
the younger Dumas the popular <i>litt&eacute;rateur</i>,
saw the extinction of much that was noble
in France, for they witnessed what we may
call the apotheosis of epicureanism. Paris
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
seemed to have lost all moral sense since
the time that its government had ceased to
have any. The efforts of Parisian talent resulted
in nothing but ill-digested and unwholesome
works. The upper classes did
as the Court did&mdash;that crew of wholesale
stock-jobbers, like the Duke of Morny,
among whom, one who was a strange mixture
of reckless extravagance and gross
bigotry presided as mistress of the revels.
The masses were sunk in ignorance, and
lived a life&mdash;those Paris <i>ouvriers</i> who have
so often taken in hand to regenerate the
world&mdash;which it would terrify the average
English workman to contemplate. The
middle class, the Famille Beno&icirc;ton of the play,
vegetated, made money, and reasoned on
false premises. It was Babylon over again,
as poor Pr&eacute;vost-Paradol styles it. Tongue-tied
on all high subjects, the Parisians flung
themselves mad with delight upon that class of
ideas which soon brings thought down to
its lowest level, 'Make money, never mind
how, and live simply to gratify your meanest
instincts,' that was everybody's maxim&mdash;<i>leur
esprit s'&eacute;tait ab&acirc;tardi</i>.</p>

<p>At the same time Paris still asserted that
superiority over all the rest of the world
which her writers had first claimed when
they began to write up the first empire.
Her writers kept on blowing one another's
trumpets, and crying out that theirs was the
great nation, and that to the people among
whom primary education is more deficient
than even in Spain was entrusted the mission
of indoctrinating Europe with ideas.
Grossly ignorant of their own shortcomings
the French were, last July, quite incapable
of forming a fair estimate of any other nation.
Because Napoleon III. had always
managed to mystify his people as to what
he was going to do, therefore they fancied
he had mystified Europe. Because he had
met Bismark at Biarritz, and had been
always fond of personal conference with
princes, therefore they dreamed of Tilsit
over again, and refused to see that on every
point their master was either outwitted or
else over-mastered by other statesmen. All
the follies which come of boasting, of contempt
for one's adversary, of unmeasured
self-esteem, of confidence in one's power of
doing anything in any line whatever, seemed
to have burst out at once into monstrous
growth in the Paris of last July. M. Leclercq
collects chronologically the choice
passages from the <i>Figaro</i>, the <i>Gaulois</i>, &amp;c.,
which show the feeling of those who claimed
to be the leaders of thought; and surely
nothing better than such a collection can
justify the almost universal dislike to France
which was felt at the beginning of the war.
Belgian as he is, he knows how bad the
supremacy of Paris has been for Brussels,
her little imitator, and he hopes that this
supremacy is gone never to be restored. In
this hope he gives us page after page of
blatant absurdity, of grotesque and childish
rant, of transparent falsehood, from the
inaugural 'leader' in <i>Figaro</i> down to the wild
dithyramb which Victor Hugo published
when he entered Paris after the 4th September.</p>

<p>It is worth while to quote a few sentences
from <i>Figaro</i> of the 17th July:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'Drums beat, trumpets sound&mdash;it is war.'</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>'France, France, righteous land, hospitable
land, noble people; always thou shalt be first
among the first ... thy name is <span class="smcap">Legion</span>!'</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>'The cannon makes the pavement of the big
city ring with a dull sound.... Make way for
the cannon, and hats off! It is going to clear
a passage for civilisation and humanity.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>'These Prussians, too, have said that you
were drawing back! France drawing back;
'tis like the sun standing still. And who is
this new Joshua who shall make the sun of
France stand still! Moltke, perhaps!'
</p>
</div>

<p>And the 'leader' (what an abuse of the
word) winds up with a prayer 'to the God
who has said that they who take the sword
shall perish by the sword, and who ordains
that liberty's furrows should be blood-watered,
since no otherwise can the germ of
freedom be developed.' Many have been
offended during the war with the tone of
Emperor William's telegrams; but even the
<i>Standard</i> must confess that they are infinitely
preferable to the blasphemous hiccoughings
of the <i>Figaro</i>.</p>

<p>The strangest part of it, perhaps, is the
monstrous lying; Austria (we are told) is
thirsting for revenge:&mdash;'The Austrian aristocracy
is wild about the insolence of these
Brandenburg margraves, <i>these parvenu,
princes</i>' (the appropriateness of the epithet
from a Bonaparte of a Hohenz&ouml;llern deserves
remark).... 'Frankfort has
shut all its shops, and its trade won't recover
the shock for many years.... Prussia
has withdrawn all the able-bodied men out of
Hanover for fear of an outbreak.' The
truth being that, except a portion of the
highest class, and a very few of the lowest,
the whole Hanoverian population went in
heart and soul for German unity.</p>

<p>This incredible ignorance of other nations
is matched by an equal ignorance of the
French army and its belongings:&mdash;'War
can bring us no annoying surprises, for we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
have the most marvellous body of <i>&eacute;claireurs</i>
in Europe,' is an assertion repeated over and
over again towards the end of last July, at a
time when the Uhlans were already beginning
to show what they were capable of,
and when French officers were finding out
that they had nothing provided in the way
of maps, except out-of-date plans of East
Prussian fortresses. The absurd vanity
which could write in this way when the
Prussians were showing that they knew
every inch of French soil, is only equalled
by the craven way in which <i>Figaro's</i> readers
gave in whenever Prussian audacity, backed
by Prussian knowledge of their country,
enabled Uhlans or regulars to make a dash.
The <i>Cornhill</i> tale, 'How the Prussians took
Mousseux-les-Caves' (under the guidance of
a sub-lieutenant who had been clerk to a
wine merchant there), is a story which has
been acted out to the letter, not once but
fifty times, to the confusion of those who
were boasting all the while about their
'admirable corps d'&eacute;claireurs.' The boasting
was about as well-grounded as that
which, a fortnight later, declared that of
Prince Frederick Charles's army nothing was
left but the remnants, and that the whole
corps of Bismark's white cuirassiers had
been cut off to a man.</p>

<p>The companion piece to all this senseless
exaggeration, encouraged, we must remember,
and endorsed by the highest authority&mdash;first
by the Emperor himself and then by
Count Palikao&mdash;is Victor Hugo's dithyramb
aforesaid. It appeared in the <i>Electeur Libre</i>
of 3rd October, and surpasses anything which
Walt Whitman, in his wildest moments,
ever dreamt of:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'We are but one Frenchman, but one Parisian,
but one single heart; there is but one
citizen left, 'tis you, 'tis I, 'tis all of us.
Where the heart is, there will be our breasts
to make a barrier.</p>

<p>'Resistance to-day, deliverance to-morrow:
that sums up everything. We are no more
flesh, but stone. I don't know my own name
any more, I am called, "Country, forward on
the foe!" We are called, "France, Paris,
stand like a wall."...</p>

<p>'The Pantheon wonders what it can do to
make room beneath its dome for all this people
who have a right to lie there....
Each time the shells fall, and the grape-shot
roars, what see we in our streets? women
tripping by with a smile. O Paris, thou hast
crowned the statue of Strasburg with flowers;
history will crown thee with stars!'
</p>
</div>

<p>It is as hard for sober Englishmen to
imagine a people delighting in edicts penned
in that style, as it is for us to read without
disgust any two consecutive pages of
<i>L'homme qui rit</i>. Hugo's latest novel is well
matched by his latest political utterances.</p>

<p>One encouraging sign is, that Paris journalism
grows ashamed of itself: the lies, indeed,
continue to the last: insincerity seems
(since the first Napoleon's time) to have
become inseparable from French bulletins;
but the <i>Si&egrave;cle</i> of the middle of November
proves what a change had come on:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'It is <i>esprit</i> which has ruined France; the
esprit, we mean, of the boulevards, that <i>esprit</i>
nine-tenths of which are made up of puns and
jokes, of scepticism, of <i>blague</i>, and of which
the remaining tenth is boastful nonsense and
absurd lies.... So long as the <i>Figaro</i>,
<i>Paris Journal</i>, <i>Gaulois</i> and all the rest keep
up above the circulation of 500, which would
suffice for the comic actors and actresses who
ought to be their only readers, there is no hope
of seeing France recover herself. Men talk
with scorn of the Greeks of the lower empire
who were arguing about the kind of light which
shone on Mount Tabor, while Mahomet II. was
breaching their walls. But these Greeks were
eagles compared with our <i>boulevardiers</i>. They
discussed a theologico-physical question, wild
and absurd, no doubt, but still showing a capacity
for lofty thought; our <i>spirituel</i> newspapers
discuss the scandals which they rake
up out of the moral sewers of the capital....
If the present war ends without having
killed, not scotched, this <i>esprit boulevardier</i>,
peace will be no use, it will be nothing
but a halt in the mire.'
</p>
</div>

<p>M. Leclercq's comment on this is&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'If we, whom the second Empire has so
poisoned through its infamous press, have not
energy enough to make a reaction against Parisian
manners and Parisian <i>esprit</i>, we shall fall
as low as our neighbours, and shall soon imbibe
that scorn of truth and reason which they
have shown.'
</p>
</div>

<p>This, from a Belgian, is at least as humiliating
to Paris as any of the Prussian victories.</p>

<p>From politics, as from warlike criticism,
M. Leclercq abstains almost wholly: of
course, he cannot help wondering at Bazaine's
behaviour at Metz; as we heard it lately expressed
by a great English financier, unable,
like most financiers, to help liking the Emperor
after all:&mdash;'I won't say Bazaine was a
traitor; that is not quite fair upon him.
But I will say that he thought more of his
government than he did of France. He
might have prevented the investment of
Paris, there is not a doubt of it.' The
decay of the Napoleonic idea is put in a
startling light, when we reflect that Bazaine
was, before the end of last September,
almost the only Imperialist in France.
Paris, which had been so delighted at the
prospect of glory as to forget all about the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
<i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>, went round as one man. In
fact, Sedan was hurried on because Paris
could not be trusted: there was no sincerity
in the ex-Emperor's professions and concessions.
The Parisians knew that, and though
they had been ready enough to shout against
the Prussians, they were only waiting for
their opportunity to get rid of their own
ruler. It is the old story of a house divided
against itself. The poor men were mowed
down at Sedan by shells from such a distance
that they could not see whence they were
fired, simply because it was 'useless' for
Napoleon to go to Paris. The idea of
really honestly trusting to the country, and
giving pledges for future conduct, never presented
itself as possible in 1870 any more
than in 1814 and 1815.</p>

<p>On one point M. Leclercq finds just fault
with the Republican government: they decreed
a second expulsion of Germans from
Paris, and they vowed not only never to
yield an inch of French soil, but never to
raze a stone of one of her fortresses:&mdash;'As
to the soil (says our author), let the inhabitants
decide; but the offer to dismantle
Metz and Strasburg, and, above all, the
little fortresses which have so long wished to
be made open towns, would at once have
set them right with all the noblest minds in
Europe: to act as they did was to play into
the hands of the King of Prussia.' But
M. Leclercq is somewhat of a peace-at-any-price
man.</p>

<p>He is a prophet, too, and delights in the
thought that France, before long, will be a
federation like the United States. Its
provinces will then (he says) resume their
old importance&mdash;'the life now heaped up in
Paris will be spread abroad where it is
needed.' Paris, no doubt, has done nobly,
and there is, after all, a good side to her
character. He is as little desirous as we are
to deny this; but, then, the fault was mainly
hers. Had she last autumn stood firmly by
the Republican party, instead of falling so
readily and blindly into the trap which
Louis Napoleon laid for her, war would have
been impossible. She enabled the Emperor
to begin; and then, by her fickle restlessness,
she hampered his movements and forced him
to fight, as it were, with one hand tied up.
Instead of Hugo's <i>Paris-cerveau</i>, M. Leclercq
calls her <i>Paris-spectacle, Paris-plaisir,
Paris-panache</i>, and he sees no
future for France except in her humiliation:
<i>il faut tr&eacute;paner</i> (he says) <i>le cerveau de la
France</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Papiers Secrets</i> need not occupy us
long; they were hardly worth the trouble of
unearthing. The Government of National
Defence might surely have found better
work for men like De K&eacute;ratry, Lavertujon,
and Cochut, than to be rummaging among
the rubbish found at the Tuileries, at St.
Cloud, and at Meudon. If they had so destroyed
the environs of Paris as to prevent
the Prussians from finding shelter; if they
had (as common sense would have dictated)
fortified Versailles, connecting it with the
<i>enceinte</i> by a strong military line, and used
their abundant labour to make the works
impregnable, it would have been far better
than to have wasted precious time in docketing
papers which are certainly disappointing.
They reveal nothing, for we already
know that the Empire was based upon corruption
and <i>espionnage</i>; and all they do is
to enable the curious reader to follow the
ramifications of this imperial system into
unsuspected corners.</p>

<p>Thus, at the outset, we have a letter from
the Empress <i>en route</i> for Suez, which
shows her grammar and orthography as
much at fault as those of the fine ladies of
Queen Anne's time, and which is sadly like
what Henrietta of France might have written
to Charles I.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'Plus on aura besoin de force plus tard, et
plus il sera n&eacute;cessaire de prouver au pays
qu' on a <i>des id&eacute;es</i> et non <i>des exp&eacute;dients</i>.'
"Amuse-toi" (is her advice to her husband) 'il
faut se refaire un moral, comme on se refait
une constitution affaiblie, et une id&eacute;e constante
finie (sic) par user le cerveau le mieux
organis&eacute;.'
</p>
</div>

<p>Altogether Eugenie does not come off badly
in the published correspondence.</p>

<p>Of the chapter on Napoleon's mistresses
we need say nothing except that it will disappoint
the prurient reader. Marguerite
Bellanger, who first fathered a son on him,
and then (after being managed by the
<i>pr&eacute;sident du cour</i>, poor M. Devienne) confessed
she had cheated him, and Miss
Howard, are the only two who come to the
front; the latter, by the way, appears to
have received in the course of two years
five and a half millions of francs&mdash;good
interest for having paid 'the Prince's' debts
when he was in England. It is unsafe to
state anything about the ex-Emperor's private
property. The 'facts' have been contradicted
and re-asserted; but there they are, in
this little pamphlet, with full details, sixty-three
millions of francs, including the accounts
with Baring of London, with Kindlet
of Vienna, with Funder and Plitz of St.
Petersburg, with Berg von Dussen of Amsterdam,
and Jecker in Mexico, and Brown
Brothers of New York. What he had in
the French funds the author, of course, professes
himself unable to tell; but <i>en revanche</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
he gives (in the chapter headed <i>ce que co&ucirc;taient
les imp&eacute;rialists</i>) the whole of the enormous
civil list, a great deal of which was
(as is proved by marginal notes on the documents)
paid by the Emperor over and above
the allowance, without the intervention of
the Ministry.</p>

<p>We all know how persistently Pierre
Bonaparte begged for money, and how recklessly
money was wasted on affairs like the
Prince Imperial's baptism, but the amount
expended per month on men like Baron
J&eacute;rome David, M. Granier de Cassagnac,
and others of the 'vendus' is prodigious;
and we are told that of the actual total we
can form no notion, the usual plan of payment
having been one which may be recommended
to our own 'man in the moon'&mdash;a
trusty go-between used to breathe on the
glass of the office door, and then write with
his finger the sum which he was authorised
to draw, whereupon it was paid without
question.</p>

<p>Of the <i>Cabinet Noir</i>, where letters were
opened, according to a system adopted in
France at any rate since Louis XIV.'s day,
we have all heard a good deal. The actual
letter-stealers were certain <i>concierges</i> with
whom the postmen were instructed to leave
all letters addressed to certain persons.
These letters were then carried off to M.
Saintonier, 18, Rue Les Cases, who opened
them, had them copied, if necessary, and, if
possible, returned them in time for the next
delivery. Among the copies found is a remarkable
letter from Ducrot, at Strasburg,
to Trochu, dated 1st December, 1866, setting
forth the dangerous state of feeling in
Germany, and pointing out that Prussia
can get ready 600,000 men and 1,200 guns
far sooner than France can muster half the
number. Ducrot animadverts severely on
the 'stupid vanity' which makes his
countrymen think they can choose their
own time, and get their Great Exhibition
well over before they begin. He says, too,
that the frontier swarms with Prussian
agents, and that the feeling between the
Moselle and the Vosges is far less French
than people fancy:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'They are sons and grandsons of the men
who, in 1815, petitioned the Holy Alliance that
Alsace might be re-united to Germany.... The
Prussians are working here just as I am
told they did in Bohemia three months before
their war with Austria began.'
</p>
</div>

<p>Surely the Emperor was warned; and that,
in spite of all warnings, he should have
acted as he did, justifies as well as explains
the scorn which all parties alike have manifested
for him.</p>

<p>These papers, in fact, remind us that imperialism
was based on <i>surveillance publique</i>,
on a spy system so vast as to embrace lists
of all the 'dangerous men,' of whatever
views, throughout the Empire. The prop
of this system was the terrible power of arbitrary
arrest given to all prefects by the
10th article of the Criminal Code. How
the nation which boasts of being exceptionally
<i>logique</i> reconciles such an article with
the principles of 1789 we cannot imagine;
but it is clear that a Government, resting on
such a basis, could only stand by its prestige.
At whatever cost, it was necessary last July
'to do something,' and at Sedan the ex-Emperor
judged rightly that he had better
fall into Prussian hands than trust to feelings
which even his uncle had not ventured
to rely on.</p>

<p>Persigny, according to the letters contained
in the <i>Papiers Secrets</i>, was Louis
Napoleon's Strafford. As late as December,
1867, he memorialises the Emperor at great
length on the state of the nation, and exclaims
against the folly of concessions:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'Your enemies,' (says he) 'under the pretence
of setting up Parliamentary rule, are
working your ruin. I see it in their every
movement. I watch them and note the bitterest
hatred&mdash;hatred! and something more&mdash;showing
itself in look, word, and gesture; and
your Ministers bow down and humbly beg the
Opposition to withdraw their motions....
If your majesty sees no harm in all this, it's
no use my making plans to put out the fire
that's burning up your house; but, anyhow,
I can't go on with abstract studies amid such
moral anarchy as this.'
</p>
</div>

<p>Persigny, at any rate, was faithful, and,
we believe, felt proper scorn for the miserable
policy which tried to secure the <i>bourgeoisie</i>
by alarming them every now and
then with sham plots. Except the Orsini
and Pianori plots, and the Villette affair of
last summer, all the plots were, we are told,
hatched by Pietri and Lagrange. Thus
Greco, who was condemned to life transportation
in 1853, was let out one night from
Mazas by M. Lagrange himself, lived for
years in America on a pension of &pound;250 and
then came back to Paris under a feigned
name, and worked as a detective. The man,
we read, is now in prison, and has made a
full confession of his antecedents.</p>

<p>That Ollivier, at the end of 1869, was
anxious to infuse new blood into the Imperial
councils, and also to win over 'the few
men of talent between thirty and forty years
of age <i>who had not already been driven into
the revolutionary ranks</i>,' is a proof that the
Constitutional-Imperialist was more clear-sighted
than his enemies will admit. That
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
the Empress, after W&ouml;rth, should have telegraphed
to her husband not on any account to
return to Paris, as she could not be answerable
for the consequences, shows a weakness
of character which the admirers of Eugenie
certainly did not anticipate.</p>

<p>These quotations from Paris newspapers
and secret documents help to show why the
Empire fell. It was unsound. However
we may differ as to the amount of culpability
shared by the French nation, or even by
the Parisians, there is no doubt of the rottenness
of the whole system. That
it has been swept away is a gain for the
world&mdash;a gain for France which will outweigh
all her hopes, if only (in the words of
the <i>Si&egrave;cle</i>) the <i>esprit boulevardier</i>, the street-idler
spirit, disappears along with the <i>r&eacute;gime</i>
which fostered it; and if that hardness towards
the poor, and indifference to their
sufferings, which are too characteristic of
the French wealthier classes, can be modified.</p>

<p>And now for a very few facts to show
what a poor idol was the uncle of such a
nephew. The three writers, Lanfrey, Barni,
and Erckmann-Ch&acirc;trian, have done more
than any others to disabuse the French mind
about Napoleonism. The cheap edition of
Barni, from which the analysis and <i>seriatim</i>
confutation of M. Thiers' books are omitted,
has been immensely read; that such a book
could be published in France in 1870 was a
sign of the times quite as alarming to
imperialists as the known disaffection
of a part of the army. Besides these
Charras, Scherer, Quinet, and Eugene
Pelletan had for years been working
against the worship of which Thiers was so
long the prophet, and had succeeded in proving
to all thoughtful Frenchmen that Fichte
and Channing were much nearer the truth
than was the romancer who wrote the 'Consulate
and Empire.'</p>

<p>Our remarks must necessarily be brief;
but we would call special attention to what
M. Lanfrey tells about the early life of Napoleon:
so much seems accounted for by
such circumstances acting on such a temperament.
Corsica was passing through a crisis
when he was a boy; his father, head of one
of the most influential families, went over to
the French side when he saw resistance was
hopeless. The son, who began life an ardent patriot,
cursed his father for not having shared
Paoli's exile. The family, however, profited
by his change of side. He himself, displaying
that same skill in managing men, above all
Frenchmen, for which his son was afterwards
so remarkable, became the confidential adviser
of the governor and his cabinet. His
children were provided for on the different
royal foundations then so common in France.
Napoleon went to Brienne, and thence to
Paris; the great poverty of his family, and
the humiliating position in which he found
himself among the cadets of noble houses,
accustomed to spend money as recklessly at
their military colleges as our boys nowadays
do at Sandhurst, made him cynical.
The references to his want of means are frequent
in his early journals; but this consciousness
of poverty did not deprive him of
his keen power of observation. His journals
are an admixture of practical shrewdness
and of originality expressed in wild bombast.
He soon took the measure of those with
whom he was brought in contact, fathomed
their weaknesses, and adroitly made use of
them. Life in Paris in the days when young
Bonaparte first went there must have been
trying to a young man's faith. Bonaparte
had been 'finished' under the <i>r&eacute;gime</i> which
was said to have existed <i>par les femmes et
pour les femmes</i>; but before he was fully a
man the old system was swept away, and
Paris was a scene on which the most fantastic
absurdities were enacted in the name
of liberty. The selfish greed of the Republicans
seems to have done more than anything
else to make the young man a disbeliever
in the grand phrases which he so freely
used. His determination to act for himself
comes out strikingly in his first Italian
campaign, when by his happy boldness against
Wurmser he had made the convention of
Loeben inevitable. Throughout the preliminaries
he behaved as an independent prince.
He told the Directory what he was doing,
and received their instructions, and from
time to time acted upon them; but the only
way in which he showed himself a faithful
servant of the government was by putting
money and art-treasures in their way. The
greed which these Parisian deputies displayed
was something incredible: and their
young general encouraged them in it. He
told them that Italy was rich and able to
pay; and the contributions which he levied&mdash;though
trifling compared with the amounts
of recent Prussian requisitions&mdash;were sufficiently
grievous to drive the people of the
Milanese to revolt. Leghorn, for instance,
had to pay two million francs for the <i>privilege</i>
of being protected against the English.
How Venice was treated is well known.
'The child of the revolution' betrayed that
city to Austria as cynically as he afterwards
crushed the Ligurian republic. 'Give them
(said he, writing of the Corfiotes), plenty of
talk about old Greece and liberty: it will
please them, and it means nothing.' He is
always the same, pitiless in his scorn of that
<i>bavardage</i>, to put a stop to which he tells
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
Menou that he was leaving Egypt. No success
ever pleased him more than the way in
which he fooled Si&egrave;yes, the man of ideas&mdash;making
use of his reputation as a constitution-builder,
and then showing 'the head'
that as soon as its work was done it must
give way to the arm.</p>

<p>Lanfrey's account of the 18th Brumaire,
when only two of the five directors, Gohier
and Moulins, stood firm, and when the affair
of the Orangerie consummated by force
what had been begun by corruption, is exceedingly
instructive. It shows how, out of such
a chaos, the rise of the ablest man was inevitable.
Had Napoleon been a Washington
he would, of course, have risen for far
other than selfish ends; he would at once
have taken in hand the constitution of
which he so well knew the defects, and would
have perfected it. Even had he been a
Cromwell, earnest and impressed with a really
noble idea, he would have looked at home
instead of abroad, and have proved that
'the empire is peace.' Being what he was,
the successful military commander, with no
rule of action, except to make everything
further his own advancement, he began by
destroying representative life, and making
even the judges his creatures, at the same
time that he entered on that career of war in
which he never paused save for short breathing
times. A true instinct told him that
either the French must have <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> freedom,
or must be drawn away from politics by
being kept always at war. He may have mistrusted
his ability to play the part of Washington;
or what he had seen of Frenchmen
may well have made him doubt whether
they would appreciate his self-denial. Anyhow
he never tried them; war became a
necessity of his position; and to make war
he did not shrink from so thoroughly exhausting
France that we may doubt if she
has suffered so much by this last ruinous
war, and yet more ruinous peace, as
she did by the long struggle which ended
at Waterloo. The recklessness of last July
was but a recognition by the nephew of the
uncle's maxim, that 'by war, and war only,
can our position be kept safe.'</p>

<p>Another point in common between uncle
and nephew, is reckless expenditure; we do
not sufficiently remember that, besides the
conscription, the first Napoleon had the
whole wealth of the nation under his personal
control. He used it as the resources
of the Second Empire have been used. The
vast salaries of senators, the bribes, direct
and indirect, the encouragement of a luxury
which made large means essential&mdash;all this
soon destroyed 'the austere simplicity of
the republic.' '<i>Il faut se montrer</i>' was the
phrase in everybody's mouth, 'for if we do
not come forward as friends of things as
they are, we shall have none of the prizes
which are being so lavishly distributed.'
It was imperial Rome over again.</p>

<p>Such a system could not last; and the
way in which France succumbed after Waterloo,
while it does not exalt our opinion of
French gratitude (for, after all, the first
Napoleon had for years given France all
that the mass of Frenchmen ask for), shows
how inherently weak the strongest 'tyranny'
(in the Greek sense) must always be. Any
one who wants a simple and natural account
of how Napoleonism grew up out of the
folly and corruption and strife of the republicans,
and of the helpless disgust with which
the mass of the nation submitted when they
saw what Napoleonism really meant, should
study the Erckmann-Ch&acirc;trian series. We
do not wonder that the writers should have
been elected as deputies for the Meurthe
and the Haut Rhin, so thoroughly do their
books photograph life and thought in these
most republican departments. The peasant
proprietor, who has bought with his hard-earned
savings a little patch of confiscated
land, is as fiercely bent on keeping it as
ever tigress was on defending her cubs.
He is told that kings and nobles, creatures
of Pitt and Coburg, are sworn to wrest it
from him; and his previous experience of
kings and nobles assures him that he has nothing
to hope if he fall into their clutches. That
was the secret of Napoleon's strength; he went
forth as the soldier of the Republic, predestined
to show Europe that it was hopeless to
dream of restoring the <i>&eacute;migr&eacute;s</i>. How the true
Republicans, who formed the nucleus of his
armies, got gradually depraved until they
became the 'dogs of war' of the Old Guard
is wonderfully well set forth; and is, we fear,
only too truly paralleled in this recent war,
in which the moral deterioration of the German
citizen-soldier has, like everything else,
gone on at railroad pace.</p>

<p>The Erckmann-Ch&acirc;trian novels have been
compared with the Waverley series. We
do not think the comparison a happy one.
They do not aim at Sir Walter Scott's intricacy
of plot; the stories are exceedingly
simple, and the events (<i>p&eacute;rip&eacute;ties</i> is the
untranslateable word which best describes
them) are unfolded historically, rather than
after the manner of a romance; the human
agent merely serves to string together a
number of sketches from actual affairs. On
the other hand, the Erckmann-Ch&acirc;trian
books show that rare power of accurate
nature-painting which belongs almost wholly
to very modern times, and which shines forth
so conspicuously in our own George Eliot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
as well as in Dickens, and which among
French writers is best seen, perhaps, in
Georges Sand. Very different this from
the landscape style of Scott, which has
beauties of its own, but which differs from
them much as a picture of Wilson, or Constable,
or 'old Crome' differs from one by
Tenniel. In the 'Romans Nationaux,' too,
there is a vast deal more direct political
teaching than 'the author of Waverley' ever
attempted. He no doubt had very strong
views of his own; and he managed, strangely
enough, to make a sentimental Jacobitism
fashionable at the very time when 'his most
Sacred Majesty George IV.' was visiting
North Britain. He is answerable for
several inversions of historical truth: he
makes Balfour of Burley and his class contemptible,
and throws a halo of glory round
Claverhouse, like that with which Byron invests
his Werterian villains. But he never
directly teaches politics. The 'Romans,' on
the contrary, do this in almost every page.
They assume, moreover, an amount of political
knowledge on the part of their readers
which would be very unwisely assumed by
any English novel-writer. The fact is, the
average Frenchman does know his own history
since '89 far better than most Englishmen
know the tortuous politics of the Georgian
era&mdash;knows it better because he take a
vastly more personal interest in it. For us,
Mr. Disraeli well pointed out, history from
the Revolution to the Reform Bill is chiefly
the record of the quarrels of a few 'great
houses;' to the Frenchman the earlier half
of the eighteenth century is the time when
his country was in the labour pangs of the
strange, wild birth which was to follow; and
the close of it is the fitful period in which
the Revolution, surfeited with blood, sank
helplessly under the yoke of military despotism.
No need to urge Frenchmen to do
what her Majesty's inspectors have so often
recommended in our elementary schools, to
begin history at the modern end and work
backwards. Our boys and our men prefer
woad-stained Britons and the strife of Dane
and Saxon to the Rockinghams and Walpoles,
and even the Pitts; but in France it is
wholly different. Hence an amount of
political knowledge in the country, for which
we rarely give our neighbours credit. Your
diligence-driver between Caen and Falaise
will point out the Ch&acirc;teau Turgot, and will
tell you all about the minister whose name
it bears in a way which would have astonished
any of the old mail-coachmen along
the Western road, who knew, indeed, Burke's
name in connection with High Wycombe,
but who knew nothing but the name. This
is one of the errors of 'our own correspondent:'
because Frenchmen have not that
blatant freedom of speech to which he is
used at English hustings, he writes home
that they know little and care less about
politics&mdash;and this of people who seldom
hesitate, on occasion, to die for their opinions.
Their peculiar way of managing things
arises from their habit of looking to authority,
of moving under pressure of a <i>force
majeure</i>; they have not, and can form but
a faint idea of, that English liberty which is
in our air, which M. de Montalembert used
to call a <i>bain de vie</i>; but they have generally
speaking, historically at any rate, more political
knowledge than we have.</p>

<p>This accounts for much in the 'Romans'
which, to the English reader, is wearying;
they appeal to what he does not possess, a
knowledge of the state of parties from '89
downwards. Every one, however, must appreciate
the way in which the rise of Napoleon
is shown to have been due to the corruption,
the gross corruption, as well as imbecility
of the Directory. No wonder
Bonaparte despised mankind, when such
poor specimens&mdash;vain, self-seeking, blindly
conceited&mdash;were presented to him as the
pick of republican France. Thus politics,
as well as national character and habits (the
habits, be it remembered, of that Alsace which
is now to become the Ireland of Germany),
are abundantly illustrated in these novels.
We do not mean to analyse any of them, or to
give samples which would be about as satisfactory
as a single stone picked out of a
Greek temple. The most touching of them
is 'Madame Th&eacute;r&egrave;se,' which, showing as it
does how heartily the Germans on the frontier
sympathized with the ideas of which
Hoche was the expounder, bears on the
question, 'How will the annexed districts
get on under Junker rule?' Quiet Dr.
Jacob, the hero of the story, is already so
smitten with revolutionary ideas, that when
he hears them commented on by the wounded
<i>vivandi&egrave;re</i> whose life he has saved, he forgets
that she is only the daughter of a village
schoolmaster who had volunteered and
had fallen, with his three sons, at Valmy,
and, marrying her, joins Hoche as army
surgeon. Men of this stamp are found on
both sides of the Rhine; and to force Junkerism
upon them would provoke a speedy
break-up of the German empire. German
optimists say that this danger is imaginary:
acknowledging the disagreeable features in
the Prussian character, they say that 'Germany
will open Prussia out.' If not, trouble
must ensue.</p>

<p>The 'Blocus' is, perhaps, the most picturesque
of the whole series. The old Jew
who, despite his timidity and his hatred of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
war, gradually becomes an effective national
guard, is admirably drawn; the details of
the siege, the misery, the excitement, are
told so differently from the half flippant,
half bombastic manner of even the best of
'our own correspondents.' The old soldier
who, churl as he is supposed to be, meets the
Jew's kindness with still greater kindness,
and who, long refusing to believe in the
Emperor's abdication, shoots himself when
the truth is forced upon him, is a finished
picture of which any artist might be proud.
And the town thus immortalised is Phalsbourg,
which henceforth is to be German.
But we hope our readers will go to the
books themselves: their appearance marks
an era in novel-writing; it has done much
more, for they are all novels with a purpose,
and have been very powerful in pulling
down the Napoleonic idol, in hastening the
decay of the imperial idea.</p>

<p>The idol is overthrown; what will be
reared in its place is doubtful. Political
wisdom is not to be learned in six months,
no matter how sternly its lessons may be enforced.
The France which accepted Louis
Napoleon, which gloried in the absurd boast,
'When France is satisfied the world is at
rest,' which suffered itself to be kept in
leading-strings for twenty years, giving full
control over its wealth, its resources, its
foreign and domestic policy, to an unscrupulous
adventurer and his stock-jobbing associates,
is not likely to rise at once to the
dignity of a free people. 'Unstable as
water' has hitherto been the curse of France's
efforts at free government. The mission
she has chosen has been to teach ideas to
others, not to work them practically out for
herself. When we read in old files of the
approving <i>Times</i> of the revels at Compi&egrave;gne,
the luxury, the extravagance, we are
reminded of the answer made to the first
Napoleon, when he asked, 'Have I not got
back the old system <i>in toto</i>?' 'Yes, but
you forget that two million Frenchmen died
to root out that old system; and you can't
bring them to life again.'</p>

<p>Why is France, as a whole, sick of 'ideas?'
Why, although they could dance round the
statue of Strasburg when they ought to have
been making peace and husbanding their
strength for by-and-by, were the besieged
Parisians incapable of any serious effort?
Why was Trochu paralysed by the fear of
Blanqui? Why should Bourbaki's wretched
army have behaved so differently from that
of Hoche, which was equally shoeless, and
almost as much in want of everything, and
which its enthusiastic leader kept at fighting
point by allowing no tents during the bitterest
winter that had been known for
years? Man for man, Germans have always
been superior to the French; to succeed,
these last must move in masses welded
together by one overmastering idea. They
had no idea, no union, last year. Will this
terrible lesson give them that unity of sentiment
which Germany, since 1808, has been
gradually feeling after, and has only just attained?
Let us hope that sad experience
may, at any rate, teach them the insufficiency
of the very grandest of all merely
human ideals. The noble thoughts of the
'Marseillaise'&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'Nous entrerons dans la carri&egrave;re quand nous a&icirc;n&eacute;s ne seront plus,</p>
<p>Nous y trouverons leur poussi&egrave;re et la trace de leur vertus,'</p>
</div>

<p>led to the brutal <i>Carmagnole</i> and the sickening
excesses of the Terror, because, though
noble, they were not sanctified. The sickness
that comes from aiming at too much
brought on a reaction which has lasted ever
since; and the fact that Romanism is the
hereditary religion of the French masses increases
the difficulty of hearty national union.
No earnest political reformer can ever look
on the priests as more than temporary allies;
no ultramontane can ever be an honest
Republican.</p>

<p>What may come if Rome changes in the
direction indicated by the Abb&eacute; (so he
styled himself) and now lately by P&egrave;re
Hyacinthe, we cannot say; anyhow, such
changes must be slow. At present the
French priesthood must be reckoned among
the bitter opponents of all free constitutional
development.</p>

<p>The next few months will better enable
us to determine whether Paris will still hold
its own against France, or whether M.
Leclercq's hope will be realized.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> We may
be quite sure that thousands of Frenchmen
feel what he so well expresses&mdash;that it is
Paris which made Louis Napoleon possible,
even as it was Paris which enabled his uncle
to be what he was. They both, indeed,
used 'France' against Paris; but it was
Paris which gave them a <i>status</i> at the outset.
Those who think thus will feel that in
the changed character of the capital is the
best safeguard for the good government as
well as for the moral regeneration of France;
and if this change of character seems hopeless,
the dangerous experiment must be tried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
of moving the Legislature out of such an
unhealthy atmosphere.</p>

<p>We have thus striven to trace the growth
and decay of Imperialism&mdash;which in its re-establishment
was the practical expression of
the Napoleonic idea&mdash;and to contrast it indirectly
with the old <i>r&eacute;gime</i>, and with the
sad delusion which, beginning so nobly in
1789, too soon ended in perhaps the
bloodiest tyranny that modern Europe has
ever seen. We decline to draw any horoscope
of the future; such prophesying is
always useless. Let us hope that God, who
'fulfils Himself in many ways,' will comfort
the faith which this cruel satire on modern
progress has so rudely shaken, by showing
plainly that good has come out of all the
evil. We cannot hope that nations will yet
recognise the truth that war is organised
crime; but we may hope that for a long
time imperialism, based, as we have shown
it to be, on lawlessness and on the glorification
of the individual, will be impossible.</p>

<p>That the beaten nation always deserves to
suffer is a maxim which nothing but a distorted
view of Scripture will propound.
Berlin is not many degrees above Paris in
morality; and France, despite the character
given of her in her filthy novels, is certainly
not without home life and deep pure home
affections.</p>

<p>All that we can say is that we, believing
in God's providence, are very sure that,
however strangely things may seem to turn
out, the course of this world is ordered by
Him.</p>

<p class="p2">Owing to the energy with which Her Majesty's

Jesus Christ to His ministry, as defined by
the Church of England, would be as speedily
removed from the threshold of offices which
in no way require, and, practically, are seldom
associated with the exercise of this
professedly divinely imposed ministry. The
progress of events may discredit our hopes
or our fears, but this need not prevent a review
of the struggle for the abolition of
those tests at the universities which are obnoxious
to Nonconformists alone, as though
it were a thing of the past; nor a prospective
glance at the clerical test which is obnoxious
to all conscientious laymen who
object to give in their adhesion to a complex
creed, and hesitate to assume functions
which are imposed by the Majesty of
Heaven, but defined by the Majesty of
Britain. This is the point upon which we
must next concentrate our forces.</p>

<p>In the course of a few years it will, no
doubt, be a source of wonder that religious
disabilities should have been retained at the
universities so long after they have been removed
from almost all civil and municipal
offices throughout the realm. This wonder
will certainly not be lessened by an enquiry
into the nature of the offices they are supposed
to guard, or the value of the emoluments
which attach to those offices. That any man
otherwise qualified to explain the laws which
govern the physical forces of light and heat,
or the principles of comparative anatomy,
should be cut off from a professorship in
these sciences, because he will not conform
to a liturgy containing the Athanasian
Creed, can never appear less absurd by the
lapse of time. A fellowship at one of our
colleges, is, as Mr. Paley correctly defines it,
wholly and absolutely a sinecure. No duties
whatever are required as a condition of its
tenure. Fellowships are held by gentlemen
who are absent from, as well as by those
who are resident at their colleges, and if the
residents in any way promote the discipline
or education of the students in those colleges,
they have extra payment for such
services altogether apart from their incomes
as fellows. The word 'sinecure,' however,
as applied to a fellowship, loses much, if
not all the odium usually attached to that
term from the fact that fellows are elected
absolutely according to their merit as
scholars, as that merit is proved by success
in the university and college examinations.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
It seems strange that one-half of the nation
should have been so long content to be excluded
from participation in the prizes of
pure scholarship, when the possession of
these, unlike the enjoyment of livings and
benefices, involved no duties either lay or
cleric. That creed or conformity should be
required of those whose sole duty was to
enjoy an income of &pound;300 per annum is
ridiculous, unless we adopt the theory that
the disabilities were meant to be punitive in
their character. The same remarks apply
to the yet more lucrative headships of colleges.
Nor can it be supposed that exclusion
from these rewards of learning by a
religious test was submitted to because the
rewards were insignificant in amount, either
singly or in the aggregate. Mr. Paley
estimates the gross annual revenue of the
two universities and their colleges at half a
million of money, &pound;50,000 of which goes to
the heads of forty colleges and halls, while
730 fellows enjoy average incomes of not
less than &pound;300 a year. Thirty years' residence
at Cambridge has given Mr. Paley
the right to speak with some authority in
these matters, but we think he has understated
the amount of these emoluments.
We should not be surprised if, at no distant
day, a commission of enquiry should reveal,
that the gross revenue of these institutions,
calculated on the real value of their rapidly
increasing property, is double the sum
named. The apathy of other sects in not
urging more determinedly their claims to
have the prizes of the university course open
to them, when the course itself is open to all
comers, is not to be accounted for on the
ground that they can afford to despise those
prizes. The explanation lies in the fact
that the injustice done them has never till
lately assumed a practical and tangible form.
The indifference of the English to theoretical
grievances is proverbial, and a conjunction
of circumstances has tended to
mask the character of the injustice.</p>

<p>The circumstances referred to will in a few
short years become hard to understand unless
we seize the present moment to record
them. On the one hand Nonconformists
had not yet recovered from the repeated
blows dealt upon them by the legislature&mdash;blows
of which the Act of Uniformity may
be taken as a striking example. Content to
be tolerated and glad to be hidden, finding
neither social comfort nor encouragement in
the pursuit of the liberal professions, they
sought in commerce a fair field and no
favour, and entered on this avocation with
an energy which has not a little tended to
establish our national importance. At the
present time we claim free entrance to the
offices and emoluments of our universities,
because they are <i>national</i> institutions, but to
a dissenter a few years ago the very term
<i>national</i> conveyed the idea of exclusion, as
it still does in such phrases as 'National
Church' and 'National School.' Nonconformists
had almost learned to regard themselves
as aliens, for so the legislature had
taught them to consider themselves. The
idea of demanding equal privileges with all
other subjects of the Crown, had scarcely
entered their thoughts. Hence the universities
were regarded by them, as were also
the army, navy, and the bar, as inhospitable
places where they would be slighted and
ignored.</p>

<p>On the other hand the universities them
selves had, at the commencement of the present
century, fallen from their high estate,
and become corrupt, servile, and dead to all
the higher aims which should distinguish
institutions for learning and education. At
that period a very narrow stream of conventional
scholarship ran through a very wide
meadow of mediocrity, which it never overflowed
or irrigated. The modicum of knowledge
required of the <span class="greek" title="hoi polloi">&#959;&#7985; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#953;
</span> was contemptible,
and every arrangement seemed to be
based on the principle of letting through as
easily as possible those who could afford to
pay, and rendering the course of study of
the studious as useless as the nature of study
would permit. At the time when Gunning
was the repository of university gossip, it is
evident that both university and colleges
were dishonest in their distribution of both
honours and emoluments; they were willing
to set the university stamp of education
upon men whose only claim to be considered
educated consisted in their being able to
bear the lavish expenditure of college life.
From this depth of degradation the universities
have been slowly extricating themselves,
while during the same period Nonconformity
has been relieving itself from civil disabilities,
and increasing in wealth and influence.
The two circles, which were once far apart,
have by synchronous enlargement at length cut
one another. Despite every discouragement,
Dissenters began to send their sons to the
ancient universities, especially to that of
Cambridge. Of those sent up a large proportion
were men of great ability. Messrs.
Stirling, Aldis, Wilkins, and Hartog&mdash;and
during the present year Dr. Hopkinson&mdash;and
many others, obtained the highest places in the
competitive examination. These men were
no doubt consciously fighting the battle of
liberty of conscience in general, and of their
co-religionists in particular. The stimulus
afforded to their competitors by the prizes
incident to a high place in the tripos lists
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
was, in their case, substituted by a desire to
break down a system of injustice which oppressed
their several sects, and the nobler
impulse produced the noblest results. From
the time of the triumph of such men the
question assumed a new character. The injustice
had ceased to be theoretical, and appealed
for redress to every right-minded man
in language which could neither be misunderstood
nor disregarded. The tacit eloquence
of unrewarded merit addressed itself
most powerfully to the most influential
quarters. However averse to self-reform the
governing bodies at the universities might
be, since they were composed of men who
had climbed to their present dignity by the
arduous path of study, these could not be
altogether without sympathy for men of like
ability. Hence the party for the abolition
of tests within the universities has wonderfully
augmented of late years, and, as is natural,
numbers as its own the men of the
greatest talent. These tests which had been
regarded as the heavy armour of defence
began so to gall that they are now looked
upon as more cumbersome than useful.
Whatever might be the necessity for the
maintenance of tests, the incidental evil that
men of such industry and acquirement
should fail of their appropriate rewards
could not but be deplored by all generous
minds. Henceforth candid enquirers began
to ask what were the uses of tests which
were to counterbalance these palpably bad
results? and men not celebrated for candour
saw the necessity of finding some arguments
in their favour.</p>

<p>Attention having been imperatively called
to the question of tests, their abolition became
certain. Besides the direct injustice
done, it was soon perceived that tests inflicted
indirect injury upon the whole body of
Nonconformists, upon the universities themselves,
and on the nation at large. Religion,
discredited by her uncharitable janizaries,
longed to repudiate them, and both religion
and morality discarded safeguards which
could exclude the man who was so loyal to
the God of truth that he would not violate
His truth in the slightest particular, but
could include any infidel, provided he were
not only infidel to his God, but also to his
own conscience.</p>

<p>Nonconformists became alive to the necessity
of claiming a perfect political and social
equality with all other of her Majesty's subjects:
they perceived that their practical exclusion
from the old universities gave some
colour to the imputation of ignorance and
narrow-mindedness which their enemies had
sedulously endeavoured to fix upon them.</p>

<p>University reformers, bent on opening the
universities to all classes for the furtherance
of every branch of study, saw the necessity
of removing every invidious distinction, and
welcoming on equal terms that half of the
nation which had hitherto regarded these
institutions as places where their sons would
not have fair play. The rapid growth and
wide influence of the London University,
where no such disabilities existed, no doubt
quickened the perception of these reformers,
each of whom beheld his <i>Alma Mater</i> beginning
to weep like Niobe for the loss of
her children.</p>

<p>To oppose this rising current of opinion
that set against the tests, their defenders
had only such arguments as could be ranged
under two categories; the one retrospective,
and the other prospective. It was contended
that by abolishing the tests the wills of
the founders and donors would be violated,
and the violence done to them would have
a tendency to weaken the rights of property,
and dry up the streams of benevolence. It
was further argued that these tests were the
only safeguards which could defend the
minds of our youth from the inroads of infidelity,
and from the hydra-headed monster
of unbelief which was quickening into such
active life. These were the two sheet anchors
cast out astern and astem to keep the
tests from drifting to destruction. The cogent
logic of facts soon showed that, however
good the anchors might be, their cables
could not hold. The application of these
arguments was singularly unfortunate. For
the benefit of such uncompromising advocates
of the tests as the Rev. E. H. Perowne, who,
if sincere, must now be pacing the deck of
his forlorn craft in fear of instant and imminent
shipwreck, we may show the insecurity
of the stays to which he trusted.</p>

<p>It is notorious that the offices and emoluments
guarded by the tests were made, not
for churchmen by churchmen, but for Catholics
by Catholics. In the case of the writer
of the pamphlet at the head of this article,
we have a singular instance of cruel disregard
of the wills of the founders. Mr. Paley is
one of the best instructors in classics, and
perhaps the most voluminous classical author
in the University of Cambridge. He is in
every way qualified for any post of classical
instruction, but because he is an adherent of
that church to which the founders of nine-tenths
of the colleges belonged, he could receive
no benefit from emoluments which
were specially intended, where there was
any limit to their application at all, for his
co-religionists. On the narrowest conservative
grounds Mr. Paley might urge his right
to enjoy promotion in the university he
adorns. If he were told by an advocate for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
tests, that the offices and emoluments were
secured to the adherents of the religion of
the state, and that they were since reserved
for the professors of a different faith, because
the state had adopted that new faith, he
would doubtless reply;&mdash;that his church had
never stooped so low as to admit that articles
of faith could be matters of state legislation,
and that the Catholic founders of the colleges
would have stood aghast at the astounding
anomaly of a state-made church. Surely
none but an outlaw to the realms of logic
and ethics could after that maintain that he
ought to be excluded. Mr. Paley has
chosen to advocate the abolition of tests on
broader grounds. He is a Roman Catholic
of the most liberal type, but as a Catholic
citizen, whether liberal or ultramontane, his
defence of his right to participate in the
honours of the university is impregnable.
We can readily imagine the just indignation
with which the claim to these universities, as
Church of England institutions still carrying
out the wills and wishes of the original
Catholic founders, made by those who are
perpetually taunting Catholics with a want
of veracity, would be flung aside as a sophism
unworthy of men who ought to
identify religion with the strictest honesty
and truth.</p>

<p>But, even if this sophism were more worthy
of the adoption of honourable men, it has
become quite obsolete and inapplicable at
the present time. The abolitionists might
concede, for the sake of argument, that it is
right that donors, living in a remote age,
should be assisted by the present administration
of law to attach conditions to the tenure
of property which have a tendency to modify,
restrain, and stereotype the political and
religious opinions of a nation centuries after
they had ceased to mingle with the affairs of
men. They might even admit that no considerations
of the wishes and convenience of
the present holders of the property, nor the
promotion of that education which is the
main object for which the colleges and universities
were founded, nor the requirements
of the nation, ought to be permitted to modify
the administration of the property by the
present governing bodies. They might further
forget that the universities were constituted
by royal charter, and upheld by continual
renewals of their charters. If colleges
were looked upon as corporations irresponsibly
holding property more absolutely than
corporate bodies have ever been permitted to
do in any enlightened state, yet these admissions
would in no way affect or enfeeble the
action of those who are now urging on the
abolition of all religious tests. They, at
least, are not responsible for introducing any
novel principle of action dangerous to the
stability of property. For, to say nothing of
all past legislation,&mdash;including that act of
uniformity which by limiting the election to
headships, fellowships, chaplaincies, and the
office of tutor to a certain class of persons,
recognises an imperial authority to remove
these limits&mdash;we have the recent Oxford and
Cambridge University Acts. The latter Act
specially and distinctly empowers the governing
body of any college to repeal from its
deeds of constitution, &amp;c., disqualifications
to office, and to abolish oaths and declarations.
The Oxford Act has a section of the
same tenor, but owing to its having been
passed two years earlier, it is less distinct and
explicit. This interference of the legislature
has already been accepted by many of the
colleges. Proceeding under the provisions
of that Act, many of the governing bodies
have removed the necessity for celibacy from
the holding of fellowships, and made other
important modifications with regard to the
tenure of office, and the receipt of emoluments.
It has therefore been recognised on
all hands by Churchmen and Dissenters, by
the authors of the act of uniformity, and the
supporters of the University Acts, by Parliament
as well as by the colleges, that the
special provisions of the donors may be set
aside in order to promote the main object of
their benefactions. It is strange that men
conversant with these facts should be content
to occupy ground which, while it is completely
commanded by their opponents, is to them
a labyrinth of absurdities.</p>

<p>In some cases the Tests Bill will absolutely
restore to the colleges their ancient rights
and liberty which the legislature had previously
ruthlessly curtailed. In the statutes of
Trinity Hall, Cambridge, it is expressly and
advisedly provided that no religious disabilities
shall bar their offices. At the last
annual meeting of the fellows of Trinity
College, the following resolution was passed
by twenty-five votes against ten: "That the
master and seniors take such steps as may be
necessary in order to repeal the religious restrictions
in the election and conditions of
tenure of fellows at present contained in the
statutes." This vote is rendered nugatory,
so far as nonconformists are concerned, because
of an unrepealed clause in the Act of
Uniformity. Thus, at Trinity, we have a
governing body intent on rendering its
means of education efficient, and administering
rewards strictly in accordance with merit,
but debarred from doing so, not by the wills
of the founders, but by a subsequent innovation
which restricts the rights of the present
holders of the college property. Such a
state of things appeals to every true conservative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
as well as to every wise liberal
instinct for speedy and complete legislation.</p>

<p>The stern cable of the maintainers of
tests having parted, is the fibre of the other
more reliable? The confidence in the efficiency
of tests, which was once almost universal,
is being every day shaken by fresh
revelations of their futility. At the Universities
the tests have been themselves tested
and found to be base metal, stamped indeed
with the die of authority, but current only in
those marts where credulity holds commerce
with cruelty. Bishop Colenso was long a
resident and, so far as his powers of imparting
mathematical instruction are concerned,
an ornament to the University of Cambridge,
yet Bishop Colenso denies the inspiration of
writings which the Church of England holds
to be canonical. If it be maintained that his
heterodoxy was subsequent to his residence,
it may be replied, that he has ceased to reside
at Cambridge because he has accepted preferment
to an office which involves submission
to a multiplicity of tests, each more
stringent than that which attaches to a fellowship.
Professors Baden Powell and
Jowitt, two of the ablest writers in the volume
which was once popularly called 'The
Challenge of the Seven Champions of <i>un</i>-Christendom,'
occupied distinguished places
in the University of Oxford. Probably if
we were to search for the home of the most
dangerous kind of skepticism we should find
it not far removed from the Combination
rooms of Oxford and Cambridge, where 'the
dons' discuss high matters at their ease
'across the walnuts and the wine.' This is
certainly the case if we may take the evidence
of Mr. Paley, who thus writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'In plain words, every one knows that a person
may be an avowed member of the Church
of England, and yet be a downright rationalist.
Thousands are undoubtedly such. To talk
therefore of "admitting free-thinking" by removing
tests, can only raise a smile in those
who know intimately the working of the present
system. Indeed, it has been well said,
that if the religious nonconformists who are
excluded from fellowships could hear the conversation
of many who now hold them, they
would be as much shocked as surprised at the
fruits which the test-system is producing.'
</p>
</div>

<p>It is easy to conceive of a case in which
these arguments for the retention of tests
might be urged with great force. It is
scarcely possible to imagine a case in which
they could be rendered more feeble and futile
by the comment of circumstance.</p>

<p>The progress of events and the logic of
facts could scarcely render the University
tests more absurd, did not these make them
day by day more pernicious to the charity
and concord of Christians of all denominations,
more galling and injurious to the Universities,
now striving nobly and efficiently
to meet the requirements of the age, and
more detrimental to the interests and highest
aspirations of the British nation.</p>

<p>In tracing the causes why these University
Tests have existed so long, it has been impossible
to avoid incidentally producing the reasons
why they should endure no longer.</p>

<p>The test imposed at Cambridge, by requiring
the graduate when he proceeds to
his B.A. degree to declare himself a <i>bon&acirc; fide</i>
member of the Church of England, not only
excludes the nonconformist from a voice in
the senate, which body is the popular and
ultimate regulator of the studies of the university,
but it also denies to him a vote for
the members representing the university in
Parliament. This is the only constituency
in which a religious belief is made to curtail
the exercise of the franchise.</p>

<p>Headships and fellowships in colleges, as
distinguished from the offices of tutor, lecturer,
and dean, are sinecures involving no
onerous duties, and not necessarily connected
with the imparting of instruction of any kind,
whether religious or secular. They are posts
of honour and not of trust. Their occupants,
no doubt, influence and control the course of
study at their colleges, but they need not be
and are not by their offices personally concerned
in education. These posts, therefore,
not only involve no clerical duty, they do not
demand the exercise of those debateable
functions which lie between the lay and
clerical offices, such as the education of
youth is supposed to imply. To use an illustration
now rendered familiar to most by
the practical working of the Education Act;
the master and fellows of a college occupy
the position of a school board, while the tutors
and lecturers alone instruct. Lecturers
in the several departments of study are, it is
true, generally chosen from the body of fellows,
but by no means necessarily so. Hence,
there is no analogy between the test imposed
on the clergy, and that which is taken by the
heads and fellows of the colleges. The former
is a pledge to perform definite functions
for which the functionaries receive a definite
stipend, the latter is a test applied to those
who require service to be performed. The test
as applied to these offices has become an unparalleled
anomaly. It is the last remnant of
the revengeful policy exercised by the Anglican
upon the Puritan party, after these
were driven from their short-lived supremacy.</p>

<p>Thus viewed, the tests at the universities
are like the Needle rocks, which once were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
continuous with the neighbouring cliff, but are
now become strange and fantastic through
the isolation imposed upon them by the
waves of the ever advancing ocean. As political
change is as rapid and certain as geologic
change is slow and sure, their bold position
is an evidence not of their immunity
from, but of their amenableness to the influence
of the forces which play upon their
bases.</p>

<p>The offices of tutor, dean, lecturer, &amp;c.,
inasmuch as they are directly connected with
the moral supervision and education of the
undergraduates in all branches of study,
including theology, stand in a somewhat different
position with regard to tests. To those
unacquainted with the universities, the distinction
between these two classes of office is
not obvious. The general impression obtains
that these national institutions are training
schools for the clergy of the Establishment,
in which training all resident officials are
concerned; but the members of the governing
bodies themselves are quite aware of the
difference pointed out. Unless this distinction
could be made there would be no <i>locus
standi</i> for the select committee of the House
of Lords appointed for the purpose of inquiring
into the best mode of giving effect to
the following resolution of the house&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'That in any measure for enabling persons
not members of the Church of England to hold
offices to which they are not now eligible in
the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, and
Durham, and the colleges and halls in those
universities, it is essential to provide by law
proper safeguards for the maintenance of religious
instruction and worship, and for the religious
character of the education to be given
therein.'
</p>
</div>

<p>All the gentlemen who gave evidence before
that committee, with the exception of
the Rev. E. H. Perowne, who has the reputation
of being the most uncompromising
and indiscriminating advocate of tests, recognise
this distinction; and all suggest that
while fellowships, or some of them, be
thrown open to all, a modified test be applied
to the functional posts.</p>

<p>The pernicious principle that Government
has a right to interfere between parents and
their children in the regulation of the religious
instruction of youth, has, no doubt,
been often acted upon. Thus that Act of
Uniformity, which is now the main prop of
university tests, requires subscription not
only from persons in holy orders and university
officials, but also from schoolmasters
in private as well as in public schools, and
even from tutors in private families.</p>

<p>The recent legislation for the primary
education of the country has, however,
thrown a flood of light on the relations of
education to religion, and of the State to
both. It is scarcely conceivable that the
Parliament which passed the Elementary
Education Act of 1870, should retain a sectarian
test as a safeguard to offices because
they are posts of education. The Education
Act was avowedly tentative and incomplete.
It was a compromise, in which the representatives
of old ideas obtained more recognition
than they had anticipated. The bill
will certainly be modified before many years
are gone, and if so the modification is sure
to be in the direction of eliminating the sectarian
element from education. Yet there
was great unanimity of opinion among the
parties to the discussion in certain principles
embodied in the Act. These principles
were: 1. That the State might neither provide
nor require definite religious instruction.
2. That where, owing to existing
methods of denominational education, it was
necessary for the State to make the various
sects its allies to effect the common object
of secular education, it should deal to all denominations
even-handed justice. 3. That
wherever the State interfered or was concerned
with education, no child who was the
recipient of the benefactions applied to instruction
should be placed at any disadvantage
on account of the religious belief of the
parents of that child.</p>

<p>If the House of Lords should endeavour
so to mutilate the University Tests bill as to
substitute a test, however modified or limited
in its action, in place of that imposed by the
Act of Uniformity, it would ask the legislature
to violate every one of the aforesaid
principles, and thus to stultify itself. Such
an attempt is certain to be successfully resisted.
We had better not legislate at all
than re-endorse a time <i>dis</i>-honoured practice.</p>

<p>The Elementary Education Act, while it
thus indicated the nature of the reform required,
also furnished the most urgent reason
for the immediate adoption of that reform
at the universities. If primary education
ought to be the care of the State, secondary
education is not less its duty. By secondary
education we mean a higher education than
that rudimentary training which is thought
essential to all children; that is, a higher
class education, not education for a higher
class. That the child of a poor man who
has shown himself capable of wider and
higher culture by the readiness with which
he has responded to the lower, should not
be able to proceed to a higher class school,
because of the poverty of his parents, would
be even more deplorable than that dull ones
should lack education altogether. The universities
form the natural apex of the pyramid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
of national education. The nation can
never rightly economise and utilise its intellect
until every one of its children, capable
of such culture, can pass freely up through
all the grades of education to the very summit.
If this is to be the case the capital
must be rendered congruous with the column
it should surmount. By reason of tests the
national universities are rendered so incongruous
with the rest of the structure that is
in course of erection, that no cement could
make them cohere. If by common consent
we must eliminate sectarian religion from
elementary education in the interests of the
child whose father is so stolidly indifferent
to the higher needs of that child that he
must be compelled to send him to school;
how absurd it is to provide that when he
has grown into manhood and shown a capacity
for the reception of the highest culture,
he should be handed over for instruction to
a body rendered exclusively sectarian by the
retention of antiquated religious tests. The
inauguration of a national scheme of education
is an <i>epoch</i> in the history of the nation.
It is a <i>crisis</i> in the history of the universities.
On the present settlement of this
question in some measure depends whether
the ancient universities shall stand in the
position of the Doric capitals which crown
the columns and support the architrave of
the classic temple, or lie like those same
capitals after the earthquake has dashed
them to the ground&mdash;the broken and isolated
fragments of a former grandeur.</p>

<p>From a review of the past struggle, in
which we have endeavoured to show how
the march of events, the advance of ideas,
and the change of position of parties, rendered
the old line of defence formed by
these tests, not only indefensible, but deserted
by its defenders, we turn to examine the
ground of the next battle-field.</p>

<p>The necessity of taking holy orders as a
condition for holding or retaining offices and
emoluments at the universities and their
colleges is a test of the most stringent and
pernicious character. Every argument against
tests in the abstract, may be urged with
double force against this clerical test. Every
consideration of the welfare of nonconformists,
of the universities, and of the nation,
which has determined the abolition of the
simple tests, is of greater force when applied
to the complex test implied in the taking of
holy orders.</p>

<p>Fully one-half of the fellowships of Oxford
and Cambridge, and nearly two-thirds
of the headships, can be enjoyed only by
clergy of the Establishment. This clerical
test is therefore a practical bar to Nonconformists
of half the preferments of these
wealthy national institutions; and the fact
that all conscientious laymen are included
under this academic ban certainly does not
commend this test to exceptional retention.
Colleges, where there is a certain minimum
of clerical fellowships, are at the present
moment compelled to elect inferior men when
all their lay fellowships are filled. In colleges
like Trinity and St. John's, Cambridge,
where all must take orders at a certain date
from their degrees, the more able and energetic
men usually become absorbed in other
pursuits and vacate their fellowships to serve
in turn to younger men as means of defying
the impecuniosity which notoriously dogs the
early stages of a professional career; while the
idlers as naturally become sinecure pluralists,
because the dignity of the priest need not
interfere with the fellow's ease. By this
system the colleges are equally dishonoured
by those whom they retain and those whom
they reject. By this system the nation also
suffers, by allowing the large revenues of
national institutions to be squandered on
cureless priests, which, by some such arrangement
as is explained by Mr. Paley,
might secure to literature and science the
labours of our greatest scholars and ablest
investigators. To this catalogue of ill effects
may be added the damage done by the clerical
test to the Church of England. Many
years of university life is admitted to be the
very worst preparation for parish work. As
a rule, fellows manifest great repugnance to
take upon themselves, in middle life, the
duties involved in the acceptance of a college
living; and the man who allows himself to
drift first into holy orders and then into a
college benefice, from sheer inanity, is not
likely to bring much zeal to his work.</p>

<p>We are quite aware that a very different
view of this result of clerical fellowships is
taken by their advocates; and this brings us
to the examination of those reasons which
may be brought forward to show that the
clerical test stands on a footing different
from that of other tests. The advocates of
clerical fellowships would state, first, that
the clerical test was not imposed <i>ab extra</i> by
the Imperial Legislature, but rested wholly
and solely on the wills of the founders and
donors of the emoluments and offices it
guarded. They would argue, secondly, that
by removing the tests from lay fellowships
a sufficient number were thrown open to
satisfy and reward all the Nonconformist
scholars who were likely to seek education
at the universities, and that by retaining the
clerical fellowships a preponderance would
be secured at the seats of learning in favour
of Protestant Christianity, which preponderance
is a desideratum with nine-tenths of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
the English people. They would show,
thirdly, that these clerical fellowships induced
men, having the reputation and acquirements
of scholars, to enter, and thereby
adorn and strengthen a Church which more
than ever needs learned divines to meet
scientific sceptics on their own ground.</p>

<p>All this may be true, but it is very little
to the purpose. Whether the colleges, or
any of them, were originally monastic institutions
is a curious antiquarian question, but
the requirement of holy orders and celibacy,
from every member of the fraternity, in
many instances, at least, originated in times
when the recognition of a distinction between
the regular and secular clergy was a
part of the public opinion of the day. A
community which accepted the theory that
good works could be performed by a sacerdotal
order which would benefit men's souls
after death, quite irrespective of any effect
which could be produced upon them during
life, might look with complacency on fraternities
freed from social ties, and consecrated
to spiritual uses when these uses were
not apparent. Nowadays, however, a collegiate
priest is of all men least likely to give
himself to works of supererogation. The
duties of a fellow of a college and a priest
without cure can be defined only as Bishop
Blomfield once defined the functions of an
archdeacon, namely, as archidiaconal. These
duties may both once have been burdensome,
but now the academic Issachar crouches
down between them, and declares rest to be
good and the land pleasant. The plain
teaching of the clerical test is, not that we
ought to follow the letter of the wills of the
founders when it contravenes their spirit, but
that well-meaning men can do little good, and
may do much harm, by endeavouring to impose
the ideas of one age on the customs
and manners of a remotely future one.</p>

<p>It is a wild expectation that the maintenance
of a Christian and Protestant ascendancy
at the universities will establish oases
in the midst of the barren desert of doubt,
or clearings in the forest of Papist superstition,
such as the several religious alarmists,
according to their bent and temperament,
would induce us to believe our country will
soon become. Let those who delight in
clothing bugbears with imaginary terrors
speculate on the possibility of a Mussulman
or a Parsee becoming an examiner for the
theological degree, or a positivist becoming
a professor of exegesis. A reasonable man
will consider the conditions upon which
such a thing could occur. Our nation must
have forsaken a faith which has existed
among us for a thousand years. Our legislature
and our universities, both equally
transcripts of the popular mind, must have
forgotten their God. In such a case is it
conceivable that a religion alike abandoned
by a people which it has raised to power and
prosperity, and by the Deity which promulgated
it, should be preserved to our colleges
by the operation of a test which is even now
profaned by men who avow their readiness
to swear <i>et ceteras</i>?</p>

<p>The great classical scholar Person, himself
a sufferer under, and a protester against the
clerical test, used to say that a fellow's life
was like the lime-tree avenue at Trinity&mdash;a
long walk with a church at the end of it.
This was said in reference to Coton spire
seen in the distance.</p>

<p>The present Bishop of Carlisle said in a
sermon addressed to the University of Cambridge,
'We want men to enter the ministry
of our Church who, if they went to the bar,
would succeed at the bar.' There was a
curious admission implied in these words,
but to do Dean Goodwin justice, he was
then speaking, not in defence of clerical fellowships,
but to rouse the voluntary enthusiasm
of the students he addressed.</p>

<p>That scholars are induced by the practical
working of the system of clerical fellowships
to take their places among the clergy of the
Establishment cannot be denied, but the argument
deducible from this, savours both of
bigotry and worldliness. A clerical fellowship
is in this view a skilfully-baited trap to
catch a Church decoration. We have many
instances to show that by placing upon
learned men the badge of orthodoxy you do
not make them defenders of the faith. Too
often the false position of a man, thus entrapped,
makes him cynically sceptical. Of
such an one it may often be said, 'A little
grain of conscience makes him sour,' and
causes him&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'Like a dog, that is compelled to fight,</p>
<p>Snatch at his master, that doth tarre him on.'</p>
</div>

<p>This endeavour to affix a plume to the
helmet of faith worn by the church militant
is in strange relation to the thanksgiving
which proceeded from the Head of the
Church, 'I thank Thee, O Father, Lord of
heaven and earth, that Thou hast hid these
things from the wise and prudent, and hast
revealed them unto babes.' This is evidently
solely a Churchman's consideration, and does
not deserve our further notice; but it is intimately
related to the wider question of the
influence of this test on morality and religion.</p>

<p>We cannot better preface our concluding
remarks on this important bearing of the
subject than by quoting the evidence given
by the Rev. D. P. Chase and Professor J.B.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
Lightfoot before the Committee of the House
of Lords:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'286. Lord Rosebery: You say that there
are Free-thinkers already amongst the body of
fellows at Oxford, who, under the irritation
produced by their false positions, express their
feelings and opinions with some freedom.'</p>

<p>'Dr. Chase: Yes.</p>

<p>'289. Have you reason to think that these
gentlemen deliberately swallow their opinions
in order to obtain the advantage of a fellowship?</p>

<p>'I would hardly put it in that way: I think
they have persuaded themselves that the imposition
of any such test being in itself immoral,
they may act in a way in which they would not
act towards an obligation which they acknowledged.'
</p>
</div>

<p>Dr. Chase does not endorse this lax morality,
for he says as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'I have my own impression of the men
whom I meet, and of the way in which they
obtrude their contempt for religious opinions in
general, but I can say nothing more definite
than that I allude to people who are <i>already
upon foundations</i>.</p>

<p>'40. Marquis of Salisbury: They come in in
spite of the existing tests?</p>

<p>'Yes.</p>

<p>'41. Do you think that that is probably due
either to some subsequent change of opinion on
their part, or to a peculiar elasticity of mind?</p>

<p>'It is due to the loss of common honesty
and morality, I think.'</p>

<p>'1001. Earl of Morley: I think you mentioned
the fact of several fellows having retired
who had formerly taken the tests.
Would you like to mention any instances of
that?</p>

<p>'Dr. Lightfoot: I am not in a position to say
exactly the motives which led them to resign
their fellowships; but there have been two or
three instances quite lately where persons have
resigned fellowships, and I believe they have
done so on account of religious scruples.</p>

<p>'1302. Do those facts have rather a bad effect
upon the undergraduates, do you think?</p>

<p>'I think they have. That is my reason for
desiring a change. They create a prejudice
against religion.'
</p>
</div>

<p>Lord E. Fitzmaurice, in the debate on
clerical fellowships, is reported to have
said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'The clerical fellows might be classed as
those who wore white ties and those who went
without. The first class steadily opposed all
progress in the universities, and the last merely
took orders to obtain the fellowship. These
latter, in fact, threw away the outward visible
sign of that inward and spiritual grace which
they were conscious they did not possess.'
</p>
</div>

<p>Lord Fitzmaurice has so lately left the
University of Cambridge that his recollection
of it must be very vivid. The sentences
quoted have just that quality of candid but
rather indiscriminate truth, flavoured with
somewhat flippant and irreverent satire;
which would have brought down the house
at the Union Debating Society. Indeed we
can hardly refrain from thinking these words
were originally prepared for the benefit of
the audience there assembled.</p>

<p>The ingenuity of the great enemy of
souls would be taxed in vain to hit upon a
device by which the ministry of Christ and
the truth of God could be more thoroughly
brought into contempt in the judgment of
susceptible youth, which is ever keen to detect
selfish shams, and ever loyal to self-sacrificing
nobility. The system of clerical
fellowships is such a scheme&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'As from the body of contraction plucks</p>
<p>The very soul; and sweet religion makes</p>
<p>A rhapsody of words.'</p>
</div>

<p>If this hoar iniquity of clerical tests be for
a few years longer maintained by a mistaken
section of Churchmen, it will be our
duty as Nonconformists, during that time, by
making a vigorous protest through every
channel by which public opinion is influenced,
to show that if these tests be <i>safeguards</i>
they are safeguards not of Catholic
Christianity, but of sectarian ascendancy; to
keep the fair garments of religion unspotted
by a worldly and turbid policy; to cause
that the contempt which cannot but be felt
should light not upon the royal priesthood
of Christ, but on the priesthood of the Establishment;
and to demonstrate that, if
truth be violated, she is violated by no criminal
consent of ours.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><span class="smcap">Art. VII.</span>&mdash;<i>The War of 1870-1.</i></p>

<p class="p2">In the last number of this Review we endeavoured
to describe what may be called
the first act of the tremendous contest which
has convulsed Europe during the last eight
months. We glanced at the original causes
of the war long impending between Germany
and France, reviewed the opening passages
of the struggle, the gathering of the antagonist
hosts, the false strategy of Napoleon
III., the great ability of his opponents, the
first victories that were the result,&mdash;W&ouml;rth,
Forbach, and the battles at Metz; and examined
the remarkable movements which led to
the catastrophe of Sedan, an event unparalleled
in military history. Pursuing the narrative,
we noticed briefly the consequences
of that awful disaster&mdash;the advance of the
German armies to Paris, and their investment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
of the famous capital; and said a few
words on the grand spectacle afforded by
France at this conjuncture, when, after her
unprecedented reverses, she unrolled the
banner of national resistance, and tried to
stem the flood of Teutonic invasion. We
felt, however, that it would be premature to
dwell at length on the scenes of the latter
conflict, because their issue was as yet uncertain,
and we postponed to the present number
a more elaborate survey of them. We
now propose to give a short account of the
second and closing act of the drama, comprising
the marvellous siege of Paris, the
efforts of France to relieve the city, and their
defeat by the German hosts, and, finally, the
fall of the beleaguered capital after an
heroic resistance. This phase of the war is
altogether different from that which preceded
it, and in many respects is more interesting.
It is not a mere succession of
dazzling triumphs caused by genius and
force on one side and incapacity and weakness
on the other; it is a frightful international
strife, in which, owing to peculiar circumstances,
the result was for a long time
doubtful; in which the belligerent which at
first seemed prostrate made a rally of an extraordinary
kind, and placed its opponent in
comparative danger; and in which victory
was decided at last through the continued
efforts of rare ability wielding perfectly organized
military force, and prevailing over
patriotic energy, strong in the elements of
warlike power, but untrained, undisciplined,
and badly directed. This part of the campaign
shows us how the defences of Paris
caused the invading armies, which had never
expected that they would hold out, to be exposed
to formidable attacks; how the breathing-time
obtained in this way enabled France
to rise again, and to put immense masses of
men into the field; and how, in consequence
of their military situation, the Germans, although
at all points victorious, necessarily
occupied a precarious position; and it shows
not less clearly how superiority of generalship,
of skill, and of efficiency in war, turned
the scale at last against mere numbers,
though possessing some remarkable advantages.
As for the lessons to be deduced
from the straggle, it lays bare painfully the
real causes of the overwhelming calamities
of France; it reveals very plainly the true
nature of the gigantic Power now dominant
in Europe; and it makes thinking persons
sadly admit that, notwithstanding civilization
and progress, the passions of man remain
little changed, that the lust of conquest
burns as fiercely at the close as at the beginning
of the nineteenth century, that experience
seems unable to teach that the triumphs
of mere ambition and force are often a curse
even to the victor.</p>

<p>After the disaster of Sedan, the German
armies proceeded at once to march on Paris.
At this moment the last regular army of
France in the field was a mass of prisoners;
the Army of the Rhine, the hope of the nation,
was shut up with Bazaine at Metz,
hemmed in by the corps of Prince Frederic
Charles; and France seemed so utterly vanquished
that even the cautious German
leaders could see no possible danger in moving
into the heart of the invaded country,
though they had not taken one important
fortress, or even occupied one line of railway.
Besides, it was assumed in the German
camp that the advance to Paris would
be little more than a military pageant or
demonstration; the city had fallen in 1814
and 1815 after a resistance of a mere nominal
kind; though it had been since fortified,
the fortifications were known to be within
the range of modern heavy guns; and, in
any case, it was taken for granted that a
population like the Parisians would never
venture to make a stand, or submit to anything
like privations. Accordingly, the
magnificent German hosts were directed in
two enormous masses from Sedan against
the devoted city, the Fourth Army under the
Crown Prince of Saxony advancing by
Vouziers and Rheims towards the Marne,
the Third, under the Crown Prince of
Prussia, descending from Rheims upon
the Seine, the object of both being to converge
and hem in Paris in an investing circle.
Eye-witnesses have recorded with admiration
how superb was the aspect of these mighty
arrays as, flushed with astonishing success,
and in the most perfect military discipline,
they rolled on through the plains of Champagne
in all the pomp and circumstance of
war, finding literally nothing to check their
progress. By the 15th or 16th of September
the two armies had made good their way
to the rivers which, in their uniting bends,
form the first lines of the defence of Paris;
the Crown Prince of Saxony having reached
Meaux, and his colleague having pushed
forward to M&eacute;lun. Soon after these points
had been passed, the first signs of opposition
appeared. After the fall of the Imperial
<i>r&eacute;gime</i>, General Trochu, who had been
President of the Government of National
Defence, had been making great preparations
to enable Paris to stand a siege; and
as it was of vital importance to retard the
assailants as long as possible, he had sent
one detachment to hold in check the Germans
in the valley of the Marne, and another
to attack the Crown Prince of Prussia as
he crossed the Seine to the south of the city.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
Their efforts, however, completely failed, the
French troops with Vinoy and Ducrot, demoralized
by repeated defeats, being wholly
unable to withstand the Germans; and on
the 19th of September the invading armies
had closed on all sides around the beleaguered
city, the Crown Prince of Prussia
having mastered a range of heights overlooking
the defences to the north, and having
captured some temporary works erected
by Trochu along their position. The army
of the Crown Prince of Saxony spread
along the northern and eastern parts of
Paris, from Charenton to about Argenteuil;
that of his brother Prince completed the
circle from the Marne across the Seine to
St. Germains, the head-quarters being at
Versailles.</p>

<p>In this way, within two or three days
after their first appearance on the Marne
and Seine, the German invaders had encompassed
Paris, and by the 22d of September
the investment was complete. It is said
that the fortifications merely saved the city
from the terrors of an assault; but, however
this may have been, these works were already
in a condition which compelled the Germans
to pause, and to make their approaches
with circumspection. In fact, the natural
strength of Paris as a defensible position is
exceedingly great; and the artificial defences,
though constructed before the invention of
the artillery of this day, had rendered the
capital a powerful fortress. Paris is protected
along its eastern front by the converging
streams of the Marne and Seine, thrown before
it like a series of fosses, and by the
succession of heights extending from the
plain of St. Denis to Vincennes; to the
west it is covered by the winding returns of
the Seine, from S&egrave;vres to beyond St. Germains;
and to the north and south, though
at these points weaker, it is not without a
barrier marked out by nature. The result is
that Paris is, as it were, designed for a vast
entrenched camp, very difficult to surround
or attack; for its situation on the rivers
which wind about it not only compels an
enemy to divide his forces if he would invest
it, but exposes him to considerable
danger, especially if a defending army held
the eastern heights before referred to. This
naturally strong and vast position had been
fortified with great care in 1841, by engineers
of the school of the first Napoleon. A
ditch had been thrown around the city, and
a rampart with regular bastions made; but
these were merely the internal lines. The
real and external defences were a series of
powerful detached forts, so arranged as to
support each other, and to constitute a zone
on all sides of great dimensions, difficult to
approach. For this purpose every advantage
had been taken of the character of the
place; the forts were so built as to command
the obstacles formed by the Marne and
Seine, and thus to enable troops to bar the
passage of an enemy across these streams.
They also crowned the eastern heights, and
thence covered St. Denis to the north; and
while one fort only&mdash;that of Val&eacute;rien&mdash;threw
a shield over the western front, four
or five, along a range of projecting eminences,
protected the southern and southwestern.
It must be added, however, that
those who designed the fortifications of Paris
always supposed that an army would be
within the zone comprised by the range of
the forts, and would thus be able to oppose
an enemy; and, owing to the invention of
heavy rifled guns, the southern forts, from
Charenton to Versailles, were comparatively
weak, and liable to attack.</p>

<p>Such was the aspect of the defences of
Paris when, at the end of the third week of
September, they were surrounded by their
Teutonic foes. The forts and ramparts were
extremely formidable, but they were, as yet,
ill-armed with heavy guns, and, above all,
the great element required for a successful
defence&mdash;a well-regulated and disciplined
army, to prevent an enemy from closing
round&mdash;was, for the present, altogether wanting.
General Trochu, in concert with subordinate
officers, had for several weeks
laboured hard in bringing into the city
artillery and munitions of war. Paris had
become a vast arsenal for constructing fieldpieces,
manufacturing gunpowder, and fabricating
all kinds of military appliances; and
an immense number of men fit for service,
amounting, it is said, to half a million, including
250,000 National Guards, had been
congregated within the walls to form the
materials of an organized force. But though
the efforts of the Governor and his assistants,
and the patriotism of the population,
had been admirable; though stores of provisions
had been laid in; though foundries
and workshops had toiled day and night in
casting ordnance and preparing cartridges;
and though the multitude of recruits had
been subjected to continual drill, Paris was
not ready when the Germans appeared; and,
in consequence, after the feeble resistance of
Vinoy and Ducrot on the 17th, the investment
was completed without difficulty, and
the first great object of the besiegers was
attained. Yet, though Trochu was thus driven
to a passive defence&mdash;what had hardly been
seriously contemplated by those who had
fortified Paris&mdash;he did not despair or lose
heart; and we may believe that he had good
hopes that France would be saved through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
the resistance of Paris. He knew that the
city possessed resources of food for several
months; he was aware that it was possible
to create a vast supply of cannon and arms;
he thought that he would have time to make
out of the crude masses of men in his hands
an efficient army inside the walls; and on
these data he formed a scheme for the defence
of the country, which, though it failed,
and though, as we think, it was open to censure,
was, nevertheless, not without grandeur.
He would render Paris impregnable to attack,
and detain the Germans around the ramparts
for a time passing their calculations; he would
form into soldiers the levies he commanded,
while provincial armies would be raised in
France. And if these forces could be made
to combine, and attack the besiegers from
without and within, how critical might their
position become, divided, as they would be,
around the capital, and distant from the
frontier, perhaps in the depths of winter!
In that case, it was not impossible that the
siege would be raised, perhaps after a great
defeat, and that the Germans would be compelled
to retire; and the retreat might become
one of extraordinary loss and disaster.</p>

<p>To make, therefore, Paris as strong as
possible, although defended passively at first;
to allow the besiegers to invest it without
molestation for some time, inasmuch as this
was unhappily necessary; to consider the
capital the main pivot and cardinal point of
the national war; and to combine operations
by means of which an army, to be formed
under his own auspices, was to fall on the
Germans, while an army outside was to cooperate
in the attack&mdash;such were the leading
features of Trochu's project; and though,
as we have said, it invites criticism, and it
did not lead to the deliverance of France, it
was nearer success than may perhaps be imagined.
The Governor of Paris addressed
himself energetically and steadily to carrying
it out; and during the first few weeks
after the investment, his whole care was directed
to the increasing and strengthening
of the defences, and the fashioning into
military shape the enormous levies which
had been collected. Heavy guns were turned
out in quantities, and mounted upon the
forts and ramparts; new works were constructed
to add their fire to that of the
original fortifications; redoubts were thrown
up at several points, and armed with batteries
of a formidable kind; the southern forts
especially were protected; and at Avron and
Villejuif, on the eastern and south-eastern
fronts of the city, the investing circle began
to be threatened by what, technically, are
called counter-approaches, bristling with
large and destructive artillery. The result
was that although the armed masses within
Paris were almost quiescent, and the besiegers
were only slightly molested by an occasional
and distant cannonade, their lines
were gradually removed and forced back,
and the obstacles to continuing the siege
became more and more evident. At the
same time, the organization of the masses
inside the city went on regularly, and before
long a real army of 150,000 men, supplied
with artillery, officers and a staff, and in a
fair state of military power, was formed out
of the chaotic multitude crowded together
when the siege had commenced&mdash;an achievement
marvellous under the circumstances.
Meanwhile, having escaped in a balloon, M.
Gambetta had devoted the singular powers
of his enthusiastic and passionate nature to
raising and equipping provincial armies;
and, aided by the patriotism of France, his
success had been, on the whole, surprising.
Old soldiers were recalled to the standard,
recruits joined the ranks in hundreds of
thousands, and immense efforts were made
to procure field guns and small arms in sufficient
quantities. In a few weeks four armies
seemed to start, as it were, from the earth,
in France&mdash;those of the North, the East, the
West, and the Loire&mdash;all intended either to
resist the farther advance of the German
foe, or to co-operate in the relief of the
capital. The first three armies were, as yet,
in a very bad and ill-disciplined state; but
the fourth army&mdash;that of the Loire&mdash;composed
largely of veteran troops, and numbering
nearly 100,000 men, with from 300
to 350 guns, was by no means to be despised
by an enemy.</p>

<p>While France had thus been collecting
her strength for a great effort of national resistance,
the Germans on their side had not
been idle. Though disappointed, as days
rolled on, that Paris still held resolutely out,
and though conscious that its defences were
assuming a very formidable shape, they seem
not yet to have supposed that a long siege
was already certain. Nevertheless, they
proceeded to clear their communications
with the frontier, and to collect supplies
from all parts of the country within tolerably
easy reach of Paris; and for this purpose
the sieges of some of the north-eastern
fortresses of France were begun, and flying
columns were despatched as far as Dreux,
Chartres, Beauvais, and Orleans, to sweep
the adjoining districts of their crops and
cattle. These raiders, however, although
they formed a kind of observing force for
the investing lines, were not properly a covering
army strong enough to defeat a real
effort made in strength to relieve the capital;
they were little more than petty detachments;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
and there can be no doubt that the German
leaders were not yet sufficiently aware of the
power of France to renew the contest. They
seem, indeed, to have specially under-rated
the real force of the Army of the Loire,
which was now collected just north of Orleans,
and had between it and the capital
only a Bavarian corps about 25,000 strong;
the reason being that in the first week of
October a part of this army had been defeated
easily, and had shown remarkable
want of discipline. Yet even at this period&mdash;that
is about six weeks after the beginning
of the siege&mdash;the situation of the Germans
in France, in consequence of her great
exertions, was one of increasing difficulties.
Nearly the whole forces of the invaders were
spread around the capital and Metz,&mdash;that
is, were detained by two vast entrenched
camps, and were liable to attack from within,
and that in the depths of an enemy's
country; and while an army far from contemptible
was being slowly created in Paris,
immense levies were gathering in the provinces,
and were being trained into regular
armies in a condition of more or less efficiency.
The German chiefs, however, elated
by success, disregarded all these menacing
preparations, and even now reckoned that a
few days would see them victorious inside
Paris, and would bring the war to a triumphant
close. So confident, indeed, were they
that no attack from any quarter was probable,
that, instead of sending for reinforcements
to strengthen the army around Paris,
they had detached, after the fall of Strasburg,
a force which might have been so employed,
to reduce the fortresses of Alsace,
and to Dijon, Besan&ccedil;on, and Lyons.</p>

<p>Such were the positions of the belligerents
in the last days of the month of October.
The fall of Metz increased immensely the
power and advantages of the Germans, and
threw a weight into the scale against France
which ultimately it became impossible to
counterbalance. It was not only that 200,000
invaders were now let loose to overrun
the country and to strengthen the investment
of Paris, nor yet that the whole army of the
Rhine, with the garrison of a first-rate fortress&mdash;170,000
men, four marshals of France,
and 6,000 officers&mdash;were swept off into captivity
in Germany; the surrender of Metz, it
is now well known, prevented operations
which, at this juncture, were being planned
for the relief of Paris, and which, but for
that circumstance, would probably have been
successful. As we have seen, the Germans
had allowed the Army of the Loire to collect
near Orleans, with only a small Bavarian
corps interposed between it and the French
capital; and they still so utterly despised
this army that, although after Metz had capitulated,
their leaders had ordered one corps
of those around the fortress to advance to
Paris, the bulk of the troops of Prince Frederic
Charles were separated into two great
masses, one directed against the North of
France, and the other towards Troyes, Nevers,
and Bourges,&mdash;that is, against the centre
of the country, and not immediately on
the Loire and Orleans. These dispositions,
which showed plainly that the real strength
of the Army of the Loire was inadequately
understood in the invaders' camp, permitted
the commander of that body&mdash;a veteran
named D'Aurelles de Paladines, who had
done much to improve its discipline&mdash;to attempt
a design he had been meditating, and
even to strike a blow at his enemy which
possibly might have had extraordinary results.
D'Aurelles, aware that the only obstacle
to his reaching the lines around Paris
was one corps of 25,000 men, resolved to
attack and overwhelm that detachment; and
there can be little doubt that, in the event
of success, he contemplated a march on the
besieged city, even though he must have
known that Prince Frederic Charles had been
set free, and was moving from Lorraine.
The plan of D'Aurelles was well designed,
though not executed with equal ability. On
the 7th of November he crossed the Loire
below Orleans with the mass of his army,
a single column having crossed higher up,
his intention being to surround and destroy
the few divisions which stood in his path,
and then to advance, if fortune favoured.
Von der Tann, the commander of the Bavarians,
either unaware of his enemy's strength,
or confident in the prestige of success, moved
boldly to attack the main French column;
but, finding himself opposed by irresistible
forces, he fell back rapidly and with great
skill on the main roads from Orleans to Paris.
Although this retreat was very well executed,
and, indeed, was in part effected at night,
Von der Tann suffered a good deal in a series
of sharp and repeated engagements at
Marchenoir, Coulmiers, and Baum; and had
the French column which had crossed the
Loire above Orleans been sufficiently quick,
he could hardly have escaped a serious defeat.
As it was, when upon the 11th he
stood concentrated at Arthenay and Toury,
covering the main route to Paris from
D'Aurelles, he had certainly lost more than
3,000 men, and what is more important, the
ascendancy of success; he had been, in fact,
decidedly overmatched; and a French army,
70,000 strong, which could have been increased
to 90,000, stood in his front, eager
for battle and revenge.</p>

<p>It is not impossible that at this moment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
D'Aurelles could have forced his way to Paris
had he known how to seize his opportunity.
Considerable alarm prevailed at Versailles:
it had become evident that a powerful
force was only five or six marches from
the lines, with nothing between but one reduced
corps; there really was no covering
army to repel a bold attempt at relief, and it
was expected that the army of the Loire
would advance obliquely by Chartres and
Dreux, and attack the Germans to the west
of the city. Such an attack, which would,
of course, be combined with an attack from
the armed masses within, would be too formidable
to be resisted, for it would place the
Germans between two fires, spread as they
were on an immense circumference; and accordingly
the remarkable man who directed
the operations of the invaders made preparations
to raise the siege, and to incur the
consequent moral loss, in case the columns of
D'Aurelles' army should be descried on their
way from the south. As, however, the
French general might pause, a corps of
about 20,000 men was sent off to the aid of
Von der Tann under the command of the
Grand Duke of Mecklenburg; one-half of
this corps, however, being ordered to diverge
towards Dreux to observe the French Army
of the West, supposed to be moving from
that quarter. Thus, even as late as the 13th
of November, not more than about 30,000
Germans were interposed between D'Aurelles
and Paris; and it is difficult to suppose,
had he moved on the 11th, that he would not
have broken down with ease the only barrier
in his way, and not improbably have defeated
Von der Tann and the Grand Duke in detail.
The French commander, however, hesitated;
he had not destroyed Von der Tann;
he was evidently not thoroughly confident in
himself; and, at this crisis of the affairs of
France, he drew back instead of advancing,
and finally retired to a camp at Orleans
which he had marked out for ulterior operations,
his success being thus rendered wholly
fruitless. This was a calamitous mistake
for the French; yet we can account for it
without charging D'Aurelles with entire incapacity.
Knowing that Von der Tann was
still in his front, he calculated with justice
that the Bavarians would be able to obstruct
his progress until reinforcements should come
up; and the news, which in all probability
reached him, that the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg
was being detached, caused him perhaps
to overrate the Grand Duke's strength,
and to halt until he should ascertain it. In
addition, and what was, we believe, decisive,
D'Aurelles knew that Prince Frederic Charles
was moving from Metz towards the south;
and though the Prince was still really distant,
the French general not unreasonably feared
undertaking a march on Paris, which might
expose the Army of the Loire to be ultimately
assailed in flank and rear. This consideration,
though not well-founded, was exactly
such as would influence a commander not of
the first class, and thus a favourable opportunity
was missed, of which the consequences
might have been immense.</p>

<p>These operations, when attentively reviewed,
show at once what a terrible disaster
to the French cause was the capitulation of
Metz, at the time when it actually took place.
Had the fortress held out till the 9th of November,
Prince Frederic Charles must have
remained around it; his movement against
the centre of France would not have been
even commenced; and, in that event, there
would have been no force which could have
even threatened the Army of the Loire in the
rear, had it advanced on Paris. If so, the
obstacle which probably prevented D'Aurelles
from pushing forward after the actions of the
9th and 10th could have had no existence
even in his fancy, and, consequently, it is difficult
to believe that D'Aurelles would not
have marched, at once, and succeeded in
raising the siege of Paris. As it was, he
had, we believe, the means of attaining this
result, had he been endowed with qualities
of the highest order; but, giving him credit
for the talents he possesses, had he known
that the Prince was at Metz, he would almost
certainly have pressed forward. And had
the siege of Paris been raised, as was not
altogether uncontemplated by Von Moltke, if
ever the Army of the Loire came up, the effect
in France would have been prodigious; and
though we differ from those who insist that it
would have led to a great German disaster, we
think that it would have prevented a renewal
of the investment of Paris. The question,
therefore, presents itself&mdash;Did Bazaine hold
out to the last, and is he responsible for the
surrender of Metz at the moment when it occurred?
On this subject, as may be supposed,
there is a great deal of conflicting
evidence, but some conclusions seem tolerably
certain. We do not think it possible to
deny that Metz really yielded to famine; the
army was in a deplorable state, horseflesh had
long been the only animal food, the bread
rations had been greatly reduced, and fever
and typhus had made portentous ravages
among the troops, and even the population.
But, on the other hand, there is some proof
that, at the beginning of the investment, provisions
had not been carefully preserved, and
that the generals and other officers thought
a great deal too much of their own comforts,
and did not attend to the wants of the army;
and therefore, although we think that Bazaine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
was incapable of anything like treason,
and really made a stout resistance, it is possible
that a more self-denying and foresighted
commander might have slightly protracted
the defence. The luxury and pride of the
imperial <i>r&eacute;gime</i>, it is to be feared, infected
the head-quarters and staff during the siege
of Metz; and it may&mdash;though we speak with
diffidence&mdash;have been the result that the fortress
fell exactly at the least fortunate moment,
so far as regards the interests of
France.</p>

<p>The apparition of the Army of the Loire
beyond Orleans, and its unexpected strength,
caused a complete change in the plans of the
Germans. It had become evident that a
powerful force was in the field for the relief
of Paris, and no one knew better than the
great commander who guided the movements
of the invaders, how necessary it was to interpose
an effectual barrier against this foe
if the siege of the city was to continue.
Paris, too, was showing no signs of submission;
the winter was coming on apace; and
the position of the besiegers might become
critical if they were detained around the capital
for months, at an immense distance from
their base on the frontier, and liable to attacks
from without and within. The battles of the
9th and 10th, in a word, had awakened the
able German chiefs to the possible dangers of
their situation, and with characteristic energy
and consummate prudence they applied themselves
to avert or remove them. The corps
intended to march northward were kept
back and brought nearer to Paris, and the
army commanded by Prince Frederic Charles
was diverted from the centre and east, and
ordered to move as quickly as possible to the
Lower Loire and the neighbourhood of
Orleans, with the view of checking D'Aurelles'
force, and attacking it, should it attempt
to advance. At the same time, the Grand
Duke of Mecklenburg was kept in communication
with Von der Tann along the roads
leading from Orleans to Paris, while some of
his divisions were turned towards the Sarthe
to face the French Army of the West; these
arrangements, however, being only temporary
until the arrival of Prince Frederic Charles
should add largely to the strength of the
Germans. In this way a whole series of
covering armies were in a short time thrown
in an extensive circle around the investing
lines, so as to baffle and repel the French;
and these would soon become formidable,
though, as yet, they were not in sufficient
force to render an attempt to relieve Paris
beyond the reach of a daring commander.
Meanwhile the French had done much on
their side, though it cannot be said that their
efforts were equally important or as well conducted.
D'Aurelles retired to his camp near
Orleans, entrenching himself with great care,
and meditating ulterior movements, and in a
few days he made his entrenchments exceedingly
difficult to turn or attack, though their
proximity to the Loire, just behind, made
them dangerous as a defensive position. At
this point, which he had made his base, he
awaited his reinforcements for some days,
apparently thinking that the addition of these
would more than counter-balance Prince
Frederic Charles, now hastening forward to
arrest his progress&mdash;a conclusion utterly false,
in our judgment. These reinforcements,
however, it must be said, were, in mere numbers,
exceedingly great, and at the close of
November D'Aurelles' army had more than
doubled its nominal strength, being now upwards
of 200,000 men, with from 400 to
500 guns; but the organization of these new
divisions was, for the most part, imperfect
and crude; the recruits were partly young
raw lads; the staff and other arrangements
were bad; and not only was the second portion
of the Army of the Loire inferior to the
first, but it did not throw into the scale of
France a force even nearly as great as that
which, under Prince Frederic Charles, was
now reaching the theatre of war.</p>

<p>Such, at the close of November, was the situation
of the belligerent armies. By this time
Trochu had completed his arrangements for
carrying out his plan; had made Paris prodigiously
strong; had greatly weakened the besiegers'
lines; had organized two armies inside
the city; and he now prepared for a gigantic
sortie, while D'Aurelles should co-operate
from without. That general seems to have
been in communication with Trochu by
means of balloons and pigeons; and, for the
second time, he began operations which had
for their object the relief of Paris. His
army was very well placed in comparison
with that of the Germans, for it was concentrated
on a much narrower front, from Chateaudun
to Montargis, its centre holding the
camp at Orleans, and its wings occupying the
main roads to Paris; whereas Prince Frederic
Charles was only just in line at Pithiviers
and Nemours. Von der Tann, at Toury, was
extremely weak, and the Grand Duke of
Mecklenburg, thrown westward, was hardly
united to his Bavarian colleague. There
was thus an interval in the German line immediately
in front of the French centre,
which offered a favourable mark for attack;
and had D'Aurelles been a great general, we
think he would have advanced on that point,
and very probably have been successful, especially
if it is borne in mind that he had a
great superiority in numbers&mdash;200,000 to
about 100,000. But D'Aurelles again displayed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
timidity, indecision, and want of true
insight. He commenced his march on the
28th of November, and attacked one corps
of Prince Frederic Charles, stationed near
the village of Beaune la Rolande, and though
the engagement was indecisive, he made no
effort with the rest of his army, and fell
back on his camp at Orleans, having thus
struck at his enemy's line, not where it was
weak, but where it was strong, having delivered
his stroke with a small part of his
forces, and having only made the Germans
aware of his position and movements. Prince
Frederic Charles, who now commanded the
whole German army to the south of Paris,
made immediate preparations for a counter-blow
which should overwhelm his timid antagonist.
He perceived that Von der Tann
and the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg were
perilously divided, and he gave orders for a
general concentration of the whole forces of
these commanders, while he advanced his
own to co-operate with them. These movements
went on during two days, the German
columns drawing together within easy reach
of the French general, who, however, lingered
irresolutely in his camp, unwilling or
unable to attack. On the 1st of December
Prince Frederic Charles moved against his
foe, with his divisions in hand; and as the
French were now disseminated, in comparison
with the German front, it is not improbable
that, at the decisive points, they
scarcely had a numerical superiority. The
result was, of course, thenceforward certain.
D'Aurelles' centre was pierced through and
through; his wings were separated and
thrown off in broken and widely-divided
parts; the camp at Orleans, too near the
Loire, proved a disadvantage rather than
otherwise; the Army of the Loire was utterly
defeated with a loss of nearly 15,000
men, and the attempt to march to the relief
of Paris ended in complete and ruinous disaster.</p>

<p>In these engagements we see the difference
between vigorous and bad generalship. It
is not pretended that the army of the Loire
was as well organized as that of the Germans;
but numerically it was nearly twice
as strong; and had it been commanded by
an able chief it might not improbably have
been led to victory. But in selecting his
point of attack, in advancing with a fragment
of his forces, in retreating when it was
not necessary, and above all, in allowing his
enemy to unite, literally without being molested,
D'Aurelles showed want of capacity
to command; whereas Prince Frederic
Charles gave convincing proof of vigour and
skill in these operations. That able commander
was seriously alarmed when, on the
28th, he ascertained the strength and positions
of the French, and perceived the space
in the long line between Von der Tann and
the Grand Duke; and had he been in D'Aurelles'
place, Europe might have seen the
Army of the Loire advancing between the
German wings, and forcing its way in
triumph to Paris. When, however, the Prince
became aware of the real nature of the situation,
he displayed talent of a very high
order; and the celerity with which he collected
his army and bore down on his vacillating
foe was quite worthy of the first Napoleon.
Meanwhile, a grand but unsuccessful
effort had been making by the armies in
Paris to break through or turn the lines of the
Germans. On the 29th of November two
large masses of troops, commanded by Generals
Vinoy and Ducrot, covered by a terrible
cannonade from the southern and south-eastern
forts, attempted to carry the positions
of Choisy le Roi and Chevilly, on the road
to Orleans, and to storm Ormesson beyond
the Marne, these operations being evidently
intended to be in concert with those of
D'Aurelles' army. On account of the rise in
the waters of the Marne, the attack of Ducrot
was not pressed that day; but on the 30th it
was renewed with imposing forces, and four
villages beyond the Marne were seized and
occupied by the French, their numbers carrying
everything before them. The German
lines were now nearly reached, and had the
attack been repeated next day, it is not impossible
that it might have succeeded, for
it is now known that 100,000 men could
have been opposed to about 30,000. But
Trochu paused at this crisis, resolved not to
attempt to do more unless the Army of the
Loire was at hand; and, as this force still
made no sign, he allowed Ducrot to remain
inactive during the 1st and part of the 2nd
of December. Meanwhile the Germans had
been combining their troops for a decisive
effort, and on the morning of the 2nd they
assailed their enemy in the positions he had
won. Two of the villages were retaken; but,
as the assailants advanced further, they were
smitten by such a fire from the forts, the
guns of which had been unexpectedly
strengthened, that they were swept away and
destroyed by thousands. The French pushed
forward victoriously again. On the night of
the 2nd they were once more in overwhelming
strength near the investing line; and it may
be doubted whether a bold effort would not
have forced it at this juncture. But Trochu
would not pursue his advantage, and as the
army of the Loire did not appear, he soon
withdrew Ducrot's army from before the
Marne in the wood of Vincennes.</p>

<p>Persons not versed in military science will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
at once conclude from this brief narrative
that Trochu was an incompetent chief. They
will say that he ought to have cut his way
out at all hazards without a second thought,
and that he missed a fine opportunity during
any of the first three days of December.
They will point also to the means he possessed
for concentrating on interior lines, and
pouring an overwhelming mass of men on certain
selected points; and they will insist
that nothing but skill was wanting to France
on this occasion. We do not wholly condemn
the assertions; but considerations of the
gravest kind must be borne in mind on the
other side. It is a maxim of the art of
war that an invested fortress must be relieved
by the efforts of an army without combined
with those of the garrison within; for, in
the first place, it is extremely difficult for the
garrison unaided to break through the entrenchments
formed by the besiegers; and,
in the second, if the garrison breaks through,
it is liable to destruction unless it is received
into the arms, as it were, of a friendly force.
The case of a great city like Paris is no exception
to this principle, or at least only in
a slight degree; for it would have been an
arduous task for Ducrot to have stormed the
German lines in any event; and, if he had,
what was he to have done with from 80,000
to 100,000 men, when he had got out in
the open country, with scanty supplies, and
without a base? There were special reasons
also why, in this instance, Trochu should
wait for the Army of the Loire, for if it
arrived, the Army of Paris would be enabled
to make its way out without running any
serious risk; and, in that case, combined
with the relieving force, it might expect to
do the Germans immense injury, as they
drew off from the investing circle. In acting,
therefore, as he did, Trochu was not the
temporizing fool he has been called by certain
detractors; and it must be added that
he adhered strictly to the recognised rules
of military science. Nevertheless, had he
been a chief of genius, we think he would
have taken the bolder course, and have endeavoured,
on the 1st and 2nd of December,
to have broken through the German entrenchments.
For, in the first place, he could not
reckon, with anything even approaching
certainty, that the Army of the Loire could
reach Paris; and, that being so, he should
perhaps have relied upon himself and his
army alone. And, in the second place, it so
happened that if his army could once sever
the lines, it would not be exposed to a want
of supplies, even if no assistance came from
outside, for had he seized the great German
dep&ocirc;ts a few miles off on the Strasburg
Railway, it would have found everything
which it could have needed. Admitting,
therefore, all that can be said, Trochu perhaps
showed himself too wedded to mere
rules and general notions in not having
made a great effort with Ducrot at this critical
moment; and had he struck with his
whole force, that effort might have been
successful.</p>

<p>The failure of Ducrot's great sortie, and
the defeats of the Army of the Loire near
Orleans, were cruel and lasting disasters to
France. In another part of the theatre of
operations, the balance of fortune hung
more evenly, though the ultimate issue was
not very different. The discomfited forces
of D'Aurelles, as we have seen, were broken
into three parts, the centre and wings divided
from each other; and even after the battles
of the first days of December, the centre
and right, driven across the Loire, retreated
hastily to Bourges and Nevers, while the
left remained on the north bank of the river,
clinging to Marchenoir and the adjoining
country. The Grand Duke of Mecklenburg
and Von der Tann, with about 35,000 or 40,000
men, were detached to destroy this isolated
wing, while Prince Frederic Charles
pursued the main body, and a series of
operations ensued which throw a ray of
lustre on the French arms. The commander
of the broken French left was
a general who, though before unknown,
has since given proof of no common talents,
and in fact seems to us to be entitled
to no mean rank among able captains.
Chanzy, in a series of obstinate encounters,
confronted and baffled his victorious foes
with a force hardly superior in numbers;
and after disputing the difficult country
between Beaugency and Vend&ocirc;me, effected
at last his retreat to Le Mans, where he
joined the friendly Army of the West, and
succeeded in obtaining large reinforcements.
This retreat was executed with great skill,
and was made exactly on the right points;
and that Chanzy was able to gain his goal
in the face of the Grand Duke and of Von
der Tann, and subsequently of a corps of
Prince Frederic Charles, moved up from the
Loire to overpower him, does honour to his
ability and judgment. A lull now took
place in the operations along the zone of
country to the south of Paris; but from the
North an unsuccessful attempt to relieve the
beleaguered capital was made. For some weeks
the French Army of the North had been in a
state of comparative order, and though it
had been defeated in November, it had
been entrusted to an experienced commander,
who had done much to improve its discipline.
In the third week of December,
General Faidherbe advanced to attack at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
Pont Noyelles a part of the German Army
of the North, his object being, should he
win the battle, to press forward and march
to Paris. This engagement, however, proved
indecisive, and Faidherbe in a few days retired
into the chain of fortresses on the
Belgian frontier, his antagonist, Von Goeben,
holding him in check along the line of the
Somme and its affluents. Meanwhile Trochu,
doubtless informed from without of
the intentions of Faidherbe, had made
another effort on the 21st to attack the
German lines to the north; but though he
achieved a certain amount of success, he
again declined to strike more decisively,
when it had become apparent that he was
not to expect the assistance of a relieving
army. The French captured several outlying
positions on the great northern and
eastern roads, and held them for two or
three days; but there being no sign of
Faidherbe's approach, they once more retired,
having effected nothing.</p>

<p>While these combats had been taking
place, the belligerents had been making great
exertions to increase their forces and renew
the war. The German commanders had discovered
that France had developed resources
of which they had no previous conception,
and that Paris was stronger and better provisioned
than they could possibly have imagined;
and though as yet they had been victorious,
they felt their position to be insecure,
bound as they were to the besieged capital,
and, in the depth of a severe winter, exposed
to the attacks of all the French armies
converging on them from every side. In
fact, in a strategic point of view their situation
was extremely critical; for if a single
one of the covering armies were broken
through by a relieving force, which thus
could reach the line of investment, they
might have been compelled to raise the siege,
and might, perhaps, suffer a series of disasters.
This danger was, therefore, to be
averted; and as the covering armies had
lost enormously from cold, hardship, and
field-service, and the besiegers' ranks had
also been thinned, it was necessary to make
very large additions to the strength of the
invading forces. Vast reinforcements were
accordingly despatched across the Rhine to
all points of the war; Prince Frederic
Charles, the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg,
and Von der Tann received thousands of
recruits; the armies of Von Goeben and
Werder were replenished to a considerable
extent, and the corps selected to protect
the different lines of the communications
were increased by important reserves. In
this way about 200,000 men were joined to
the armies already in France; and at the
same time no pains were spared to accelerate
the arrival of siege trains before Paris,
in order to open fire on the defences. This
task, however, was extremely difficult, on
account of the distance from the frontier,
and the state of the roads; and though,
during more than two months, heavy guns
had been gradually sent up, it was not until
near the end of December that batteries,
more nearly adequate to the purpose, had
been constructed and armed. Meantime,
the French had been equally energetic, but
the results obtained had been very inferior.
Recruits, indeed, had been despatched in
masses to increase the bulk of the provincial
armies; munitions of war were obtained in
quantities, and nothing, it must be said, was
left undone which patriotism and devotion
could accomplish. But though the divided
parts of the Army of the Loire, and though
the Armies of the North and the East became
very formidable in mere numbers, the
accession of raw and unformed levies,
without proper military organization, did
not much augment their real power; and
as many of the best soldiers in the force
commanded by D'Aurelles had perished in
the recent engagements, it is not improbable
that the strength of France was hardly
greater towards the end of December than
it had been three weeks previously, whereas
that of Germany had increased to a degree
that made the German generals masters of
the situation in all its aspects.</p>

<p>Such, about Christmas, was the relative
strength and condition of the belligerent
armies. At this moment, Prince Frederic
Charles, Von der Tann, and the Grand
Duke of Mecklenburg, held a central position
between Orleans and Chartres, having
Chanzy in advance of Le Mans, and the remainder
of the Army of the Loire rallied
by Bourbaki at Bourges and Nevers; Faidherbe
was held in check by Von Goeben;
to the east Werder, who had been told off
after the fall of Strasburg to overrun the
south, was confronted by the French Army
of the East, with an irregular force under
Garibaldi; and, as we have seen, the vast
circle of the covering armies was more formidable
than it had been at any preceding
time. In this state of things an extraordinary
scheme was formed for the French provincial
armies, and ultimately for the relief
of Paris, which we can only describe as the
extreme of rashness. Werder had for some
time invested Belfort, while part of his forces
lay in Franche Comt&eacute;; and as he had not
more than 50,000 men, and Bourbaki was
at no great distance with perhaps not less
than 120,000, an opportunity seemed given
to strike a blow, which it was hoped might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
crush this foe, and even change the aspect
of the contest. If Bourbaki were to assail
Werder from Bourges and Nevers, he would
probably destroy him; and if so, he could
relieve Belfort, and furthermore, by a bold
advance on Nancy and Luneville, fall upon
the great line of German communications
from Strasburg to Paris along the main railway.
But a stroke of this kind would in
all probability compel the siege of Paris to
be raised, for the Germans could not so easily
subsist if their supplies were cut off or even
interrupted; and if they were obliged to retire,
the paramount object of French strategy
would be attained by this single operation.
The movement of Bourbaki, too, was not
only promising in itself, for it was difficult
to imagine that he would not crush Werder,
which, being done, all the rest would follow;
but, properly conceived, it need not endanger
the French armies in other parts of the
theatre. Let it be granted that the withdrawal
of Bourbaki would relieve Prince
Frederic Charles of an enemy, would the
Prince, Von der Tann, and the Grand Duke
of Mecklenburg turn round and fall in full
force on Chanzy? And, even if they did,
would not Chanzy, with his large army in
position at Le Mans, be strong enough to
baffle their efforts? And even supposing
Chanzy defeated, how little was to be
thought of a defeat provided Bourbaki relieved
Paris by seizing and cutting the German
communications? Besides, was it not
very conceivable that Prince Frederic Charles
would pursue Bourbaki, in which case that
commander would escape him, and that he
would not think of attacking Chanzy?</p>

<p>Such was their plan, and, we repeat, it
was, under the circumstances, simply insensate.
No one will deny that to overwhelm
Werder, to effect the raising of the siege of
Belfort, and to sever the communications of
the Germans, were desirable objects for the
French; and had Bourbaki reached in force
the main railway from Strasburg to Paris,
this might have caused the relief of the
capital. But, in the actual state of the
French armies&mdash;raw, ill-provided, and ill-disciplined&mdash;a
movement like this was extremely
difficult, and far from likely to be
at all successful, even as regards the mere
reaching Belfort; and it was open to the
decisive objection that it enabled Prince
Frederic Charles to oppose all his forces to
Chanzy and overwhelm him, in conjunction
with his German colleagues. The scheme,
therefore, exposed the French on one side
to certain disaster, and, on the other, was
really far from hopeful; and it not only
made it almost impossible to expect the relief
of Paris, but it might lead to terrible
results should Bourbaki fail or prove a bad
General, In an unfortunate hour for France,
however, this reckless project was adopted;
and in the first days of January, Bourbaki
broke up from Bourges and Nevers to reach
Franche Comt&eacute;, and made his way to his first
point, Belfort. The operations that ensued
were just such as might have been foreseen.
The instant that Prince Frederic Charles
had ascertained that Bourbaki's army was on
its way to the distant east, he turned rapidly
upon Chanzy, and directed his own reinforced
corps, with those of Von der Tann and the
Grand Duke, to converge without delay on
Le Mans and overwhelm his French antagonist.
The movement began in the first days
of January; and as the united German
armies were probably 140,000 strong, whereas
Chanzy was hardly superior in mere numbers,
and had little but undisciplined levies
in his ranks, the issue was not for a moment
doubtful. Chanzy, who had made a feint
forward, and had threatened the Prince before
Vend&ocirc;me, found himself pressed by an
irresistible enemy, and fell back at once on
Le Mans, not having been, we believe, informed
of the project which had detached
Bourbaki. His retreat was conducted with
marked ability, his German foes closing in
on all sides, and endeavouring to cut him
off from his point; and nothing save his judicious
foresight enabled him to save even a
part of his army. Chanzy had fortified
a strong position before Le Mans, on the
river Huisne&mdash;so strong that it has been compared
to Torres Vedras by an eye-witness&mdash;and
he succeeded in making a stand on this,
and even baffling his enemy for a time. The
contest, however, was too unequal; his
lines were turned on the night of the 11th;
Le Mans was captured the next day; and
Chanzy's army, beaten and demoralized, lost,
it is said, 20,000 prisoners.</p>

<p>While these events had been in progress,
Bourbaki had been making his way across
the rugged and hilly country which divides
Burgundy from Franche Comt&eacute;. The cold
of the winter was intense; and his divisions,
composed of young recruits, ill-clothed, ill-fed,
and ill-disciplined, suffered cruelly, and
were half demoralized before they saw even
the face of an enemy. At Dijon he obtained
reinforcements drawn from the French Army
of the East, and with a force, nominally 140,000
strong, with from 300 to 400 guns, he
proceeded through the intricate defiles, between
the rivers Ognon and Doubs, which
lead to the hills around Belfort. The march
of his weak and untrained columns, confined
to a single narrow route, was necessarily extremely
slow; and it is decisive against Bourbaki's
generalship that, at a time when speed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
was of the greatest importance, he did not
advance by four or five roads, and thus make
expedition possible. The French army, worn
out and harassed, and especially wanting in
staff officers, moved at the rate of four or
five miles a day only, and the result was that
it completely failed to cut off Werder, as had
been expected, and that that general was enabled
to retreat leisurely and cover Belfort.
A rear-guard engagement took place at Villersexel,
on the 6th of January, and it was
not until the 14th that Bourbaki reached the
Lisaine&mdash;a tributary of the Doubs in front of
the fortress&mdash;where he found Werder's army
drawn up in entrenched positions, and awaiting
its foe. A series of combats ensued, in
which the raw and bad French troops, although
numerically three to one, were unable
to gain any success; and, on the 18th, Bourbaki
retreated, having lost from 8,000 to
10,000 men, and having met nothing but
heavy disaster. His army, baffled and half
starving, began to disband and go to pieces;
and, as he retreated by the narrow defiles by
which he had before advanced, he did not
reach Besan&ccedil;on till the 22nd. Meanwhile
Von Moltke had been directing a terrible and
decisive stroke against him. As soon as the
great German commander had become aware
of Bourbaki's movements, he massed a force
of some 50,000 men between Auxerre and
Chatillon-sur-Seine, and launched it across
the hills of Burgundy upon the flank and rear
of the Frenchman, while Werder, pressing
forward from the Lisaine, advanced against
him through Franche Comt&eacute;. By the 24th
of January, four German divisions had passed
Dijon and reached D&ocirc;le on the Doubs, to
the south of Besan&ccedil;on, while a large part of
Werder's forces were threatening Bourbaki
from the north; and thus the unfortunate
French army was already almost completely
hemmed in by its vigorous and indefatigable
pursuers. The disgrace of a second Sedan
flashed across the mind of the French commander,
and in a paroxysm of despair he
shot himself, unable to brave the impending
peril. His army, a mere dissolving mass,
rolled out helplessly from Besan&ccedil;on, and endeavoured
to make its way southward, but
finding all the roads occupied, it turned aside
and crossed the Swiss frontier. There the
starving mob of disbanding fugitives was
obliged helplessly to lay down its arms.</p>

<p>Such was the end of the expedition, ill-planned
and still worse executed. The detachment
of Bourbaki to the east caused
the overthrow of Chanzy at Le Mans, by
setting Prince Frederic Charles free; and the
bad state of Bourbaki's army, and even more,
his deplorable conduct, led to the catastrophe
we have described. What, indeed, could
have been more unwise than to have moved
in a single column only, when celerity was
the first consideration; and what could have
been more shameful than the management of
the retreat to Besan&ccedil;on, and the rash act
which left an army at that place without a
commander? These things are simply without
excuse; yet it must be added that the
condition of Bourbaki's troops made it very
improbable that he could, under any circumstance,
have accomplished the task which he
undertook, at least that he could ever have
reached the great line of the German communications;
and accordingly, even when it seemed
most promising, the whole enterprise cannot
be justified. The result might have been
very different if the forces of Bourbaki and
Chanzy had been concentrated for a vigorous
attack on Prince Frederic Charles and his
colleagues on the line between Orleans, Vendome,
and Chartres. Had this been done
the French would have largely outnumbered
their foes, and even had they failed and been
defeated, they would have been able to make
good their retreat without incurring a terrible
disaster. The more we study the operations
of the French armies in the month of January,
the more we see how ill-devised they
were; while, on the other hand, the strategy
of the Germans&mdash;of Werder, in the stand he
made on the Lisaine, and of Von Moltke in
surrounding Bourbaki&mdash;is deserving of the
highest admiration; and, though no one
would think of comparing the young French
troops with their veteran foes, it is not the
less true that the final issue was decided in
the main by generalship. Everywhere else
in the theatre of war, while these disasters
were taking place, the fortunes of France
were in calamitous eclipse. The German
Army of the North was taking the fortresses
on her north-eastern frontier without difficulty
by a brief bombardment, the old bastions
of Vauban's time being useless against modern
heavy guns, and the triple barrier of
Louis XIV. was thus broken down from
within, and the Northern Departments laid
open. Faidherbe had fought two battles in
a vain attempt to resist the invaders; but,
though he gained some success at Bapaume,
over a small part of Von Goeben's army, he
had been unable to follow it up, and soon afterwards
he was defeated with great and
ruinous loss at St. Quentin&mdash;an ominous
name in French annals. After this disaster
the French Army of the North was no longer
able to keep the field. Faidherbe took refuge
in Lille and Cambrai, and the tide of German
invasion flowed irresistibly to the borders of
Artois and Hainault.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the progress of the great siege
had been tending to its inevitable conclusion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
On the 27th of December, the German batteries
commenced the reduction of the outwork
constructed by Trochu on Mont Avron,
and in two days it was silenced and destroyed,
the defences being feeble and incomplete.
This roused the spirits of the besiegers; and
as, by this time, their siege trains had come
up in considerable numbers, fire was opened
on the southern and eastern forts, and for
some weeks was kept up with vigour. The
distance, however, of the attacking batteries
from the defences of Paris was very great,
nor was their artillery powerful; and it cannot
be said that they succeeded in making a
serious or lasting impression. In fact, the
forts, and even the ramparts, were armed with
rather stronger ordnance, and they maintained
a combat at least equal to that of the
heavy guns that were directed against them.
The bombardment of the city was next attempted,
and shells were poured into its
streets and squares; but as the extreme
range of the German guns extended only to
one bank of the Seine, no great damage, fortunately,
was done, and, as often has happened
in other cases, the effect on the spirits of
the population was rather to stimulate than
to alarm. 'You might as well have pelted
Paris with bottles,' was the remark of an intelligent
eye-witness, and there can be no
doubt that the active siege of the capital was
a complete failure. Meantime, however,
famine was doing the work which fire and
sword could not have accomplished. The
city had been amply provisioned, but, at the
end of four months and a half, it was reduced
to the extreme of misery. For many weeks
horseflesh had been the only animal food of
the population; the bread doled out in scanty
rations was a vile compound of bran and
rye; the mortality among the old and young
was appalling; the supply of fuel had fallen
short, and that in the depths of a fearful winter.
On the 19th of January, Trochu made
a last effort against the besiegers' lines, but,
as might have been anticipated, it failed, his
troops having lost all courage and worth. By
this time all hope of relief from the provincial
armies had been frustrated, and at last,
on the 130th day of the siege, the proud
capital was subdued by famine. The line of
the defences was almost uninjured; and,
unquestionably, Paris would have held out
for months, nay, perhaps might have proved
impregnable, had the citizens possessed the
means of subsistence.</p>

<p>The fall of Paris brought to a close the
internecine strife between France and Germany.
The extraordinary disasters of January,
indeed (especially the ruin of Bourbaki's
army), had made resistance no longer possible;
and, in all probability, had the war gone
on, the vanquished country would have been
overrun. Those who, like ourselves, were of
opinion that the expected surrender of the
capital need not necessarily terminate the
struggle, could not have anticipated the fatal
strategy which annihilated the provincial
armies of France in futile movements and
desperate efforts. We believe the National
Assembly was right in accepting the conditions
of the Germans, harsh and relentless as
these were; and we applaud the patriotism
of M. Thiers in bowing before the doom of
fate, and offer him our respect and sympathy.
Our space has been already outrun, and we
cannot make any general remarks on the
mighty conflict which has just closed.</p>

<p>As regards its consequences, we can only
hazard two or three anticipations of the future.
Those who believed in the moderation
and civilization of the gigantic power of
which Bismark has been the creator must
have been disappointed at the German terms;
but as we are not among the credulous, we
cannot say that we have been surprised.
The annexation, however, of Alsace and
Lorraine against the will of two millions
of the brave inhabitants of those
provinces, the dismemberment of France,
and her spoliation, and, above all, the
evident understanding between the autocrats
of Russia and Germany, are simply the triumphs
of brute force&mdash;perpetual menaces to
the peace of Europe. As regards France,
her destiny is uncertain; and it remains to
be seen whether, as of old, she will rise
superior to misfortune, or whether, like
Spain, she will henceforth decline and sink
into an inferior power. If, as we think, the
first alternative is that which history will yet
witness, France certainly will renew the combat,
and endeavour to regain from her pitiless
foe, not only her strategic position, but the
conquered territories. To effect this purpose
she will avail herself of any alliances, however
abnormal&mdash;and for this she is not to be
condemned. From this point of view, also,
the prospect for England is not reassuring.
France, however, if she would renew her
strength, must first learn self-government, and
to combat anarchy and revolution; and,
deeply as we sympathise with her, she
would, we believe, achieve more if she were
to attain these great ends than if she were to
avenge Sedan by a second Jena, and march
once more in triumph to Berlin.

<p class="p2">The English people have not treated their
great philosophers well. They have profited
by them, made use of their results, and embodied
in political, social, and religious life
the principles which men like Bacon, Hobbes,
Locke, Berkeley, and Hume have laboriously
thought out and sent forth to enrich the common
stock of human knowledge; but they
have not sufficiently honoured their intellectual
guides. They have not striven to obtain a
clear and consistent conception of the whole
of each great man's life, nor have they cared
to estimate the full sweep of his influence
upon the thought of his fellows. They have
been content to sum up the result of life
labours in the meagre formula, Hobbes, who
was the father of Locke, who was the father
of Berkeley, who was the father of Hume.
They have measured the ingathering influence
of the lake by the amount of water carried
into it by the stream coming from the
lake above, its outgoing action by the amount
of water which the river bears away to the
lake beneath. The thousand rills which
trickle down from the hills and neighbouring
highlands are forgotten, the constant unseen
action of air and heat and light bearing away
the myriad waterdrops to store them in the
clouds of the firmament, ready to hear when
the corn and the vine call to the earth, and
the earth calleth to the heavens, and to answer
in life-bringing showers, is left unremembered.
Until Cambridge gave us Bacon's
Works, edited by Messrs. Ellis and Spedding,
England had not one good annotated edition
of her great philosophers. Oxford has now
given us Berkeley. We have only hope to
trust to for Locke and Hume, the greatest
and most powerful of all. And English
philosophy pays the penalty of the neglect in
the one-sidedness, superficiality, and inadequateness
which have to some extent
characterized it. It is with great pleasure,
therefore, that we welcome this beautiful,
complete, and carefully-edited edition of the
works of Bishop Berkeley, and thank the
authorities of the Clarendon Press for what
we hope is only the first fruits of a series of
our great philosophers.</p>

<p>There is wisdom in the selection. Bishop
Berkeley, of all English thinkers, is most
easily misunderstood when detached portions
of his writings are studied by themselves
apart from their relation to the whole, and
when his philosophy is criticised by those
who have no knowledge of his life. How
many of those who know and have discussed
Berkeley's theory of vision, his nominalism,
and his sensationalism, are aware that the
theory of vision was only the first step in the
exposition of a comprehensive theory of
causality,&mdash;that his nominalism was only the
denial of the conceptualist doctrine of universals,
was suppressed in his latest writings,
as if he had felt it to have been too sweeping,
and was supplanted by a doctrine of realism
almost akin to Plato's,&mdash;and that his
sensationalism, inherited from Locke and bequeathed
to Hume, was only one moment in
a Platonic idealism, which he had learnt in
his youth from More and Norris, in his old
age from Plotinus and the Neo-Platonists,
and which he left to be developed by Kant.
The truth is, that in Berkeley we have the
meeting-place of two distinct streams of
thought, both of which had already received
distinct but inadequate expression in England.
He inherits the intellectual wealth of
the Cambridge Platonists, as well as the
clearer, though less profound results of Hobbes
and Locke. He has been misunderstood
and misrepresented because his double position,
inadequately expressed, and not uniformly
maintained, has been unknown to so
many of his readers, Berkeley, the disciple
of Locke, the Nominalist, the amiable, unconscious
sceptic, is familiar to most students
of philosophy. Berkeley, the Platonist, the
Realist, the idealist combatant of scepticism,
who found in Miss Forster the mystic and the
disciple of F&eacute;n&eacute;lon and Madame Guyon the
lady 'whose humour and turn of mind pleased
him beyond anything that he knew in her
whole sex,' is not so well known.</p>

<p>The great value which this edition of Berkeley's
philosophical writings will have is
that it presents us with the whole of his philosophy,
and by some pregnant annotations
enables us to trace the unity of the principle
which binds them into a more or less consistent
whole. Professor Fraser, in preparing
this edition, has kept the following objects
chiefly in view:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'(1.) To revise the text of the works formerly
published, and to present them in a satisfactory
arrangement.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span></p>

<p>'(2.) To help the reader to reach Berkeley's
own point of view in each work, by means of
bibliographical and analytical prefaces, and occasional
annotations or brief dissertations, in
which the author might be compared with himself,
and studied in his relations to the circumstances
in which he wrote.</p>

<p>'(3.) To collect and publish any hitherto unpublished
writings of Berkeley which might illustrate
his opinions or character.</p>

<p>'(4.) To offer a comprehensive conception of
his implied philosophy as a whole.'
</p>
</div>

<p>These objects have been so well realized
that we are enabled for the first time to survey
Berkeley's character and opinions as a
whole, to see how his life and philosophy act
and react on each other, to view his great
principles dimly shaping themselves in his
earliest speculation recorded in his student
common-place book, and to see how his latest
and deepest thoughts are but the more adequate
expression of his early musings. Professor
Fraser's summary of Berkeley's philosophy,
given in the fourth volume, will do
much to destroy and render impossible the
one-sided criticism to which the opinions of
the philosopher have been so long subjected.
He has shown that Berkeley's philosophy is
not the dried-up intellectual cistern of a solitary
thinker of the last century&mdash;is not a
barren 'subjective idealism' which a breath
of 'common sense' can 'for ever render impossible,'
but is a living fountain from which
our greatest modern English thinkers have
not disdained to draw; and he might have
shown that it is instinct with the germs of
those philosophical principles which under
the name of the <i>Ideal-Realismus</i>, are leavening
modern German thought. We venture
to predict that hereafter every historian and
critic of philosophy will have to reconsider
the commonplace verdict which, first pronounced
by Dr. Thomas Reid in this country,
by Kant in Germany, and by Cousin in
France, has been repeated wearisomely by
their successors. At the same time, we would
not homologate every statement which Professor
Fraser has made about the philosophy
of his author. We are inclined to think that
he has not sufficiently recognised the historical
position of Bishop Berkeley. He has too
much regarded him as occupying a unique
place in the history of speculation, and neglected
some of those facts of English philosophy
which serve to explain Berkeley's position
and principles. No thinker, and especially
no great thinker, can occupy a position
historically inexplicable. He is the exponent
of the thoughts and feelings of his
time, the interpreter of their present meaning,
and the unconscious prophet of their future
development. And Berkeley was no exception
to this rule. It is just because he
lived in an age in which two different
streams met, and because he alone of the
thinkers then living combined them, that he
is to be reckoned among the few great English
thinkers; and it is because the two tendencies
then at work and conflicting with
each other contained the undeveloped germs
of the living principles now combining that
Berkeley's philosophy is not to be thrown
aside as a useless relic of the past, but to be
studied as the inadequate expression of much
that is deepest and truest in the present English
and German philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> 'England's
Antiphon' against the sensational psychology,
sceptical metaphysics, and utilitarian
ethics, which form the bulk of her contributions
to the general stock of philosophy, has
usually found expression in her poetry and
religion rather than in her philosophy; but
there have always been thinkers who have refused
to accept the common creed, and to
suffer themselves to glide down the stream
of popular opinion. Their protest has seldom
been loud-voiced. They have generally
lived solitary, unheeded lives; but their
presence, like a scent unseen, has had its impalpable,
invisible influence. English mysticism
is a fact, though unrecorded in the
pages of the history of her philosophers; and
English mysticism was never stronger than in
the generation preceding Berkeley. The
Cambridge Platonists had but lately passed
away. Four or five translations of Jacob
B&ouml;hmen had showed the popular studies,
Norris of Bemerton was so well known that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
his philosophy could be ridiculed in an elaborate
parody, and Tom Brown, 'of facetious
memory,' could tickle a not too fastidious
public with a caricature of his Platonic love.
The influence of Malebranche was felt upon
English philosophy. F&eacute;n&eacute;lon and Madame
Guyon had their English disciples, and the
gross immorality of the times of the earlier
Georges had its opposite in the refined mysticism
which appears in many of the religious
and philosophical writers of the period. By
education, training, studies and temperament,
Berkeley was fitted to combine this mystical
philosophy with the ruder and more practical
sensationalism of Locke. He did so; and
because he did so, he begins the second period
of modern philosophy. However we regard
Berkeley&mdash;whether as a man, as a Christian
philanthropist, or as a metaphysician&mdash;we
find the same unconscious combination of
practical sagacity and of refined enthusiasm,
a keen eye for fact, and a deep mind for theory,
along with a continual incapacity to
combine adequately or express fully, either
by action or speech, the double tendency
which is the secret of his power. We feel
as if Berkeley were always struggling with a
great thought which he did not wholly see,
and could not adequately express. The
young student of Trinity College is labouring
to record in his commonplace book a
principle which will prove to be the universal
solvent, and set right everything that is
wrong. The young philosopher has elaborated
the principles of human knowledge
which are to banish scepticism, re-establish
theology, philosophy, and the physical
sciences on new and lasting foundations. The
missionary has a scheme for transplanting the
virtues, arts, and sciences to a new continent,
since an extravagant nobility and a reckless
and dishonest passion for speculation have
impoverished and demoralized the chief
countries in Europe. The philanthropic bishop
finds that a national bank will redeem
his country from all her troubles, and that
tar-water is a panacea for every ill the flesh
is heir to. Everywhere we find the practical
man and the idealist. Everywhere we find
the same keen eye for facts not quite comprehensive
enough; the same wealth of ideas
which, nevertheless, wants the intellectual
momentum needed to carry out a great philosophical
conception; the same prophetic
vision of principles and facts which are afterwards
to become plain, accompanied by the
inability to clear the way for their present
manifestation.</p>

<p>Professor Fraser has given us a beautiful
picture of young Berkeley and his surroundings
in Trinity College, Dublin. Born at Dysart
Castle, in the beautiful valley of the
Nore, and educated at the famous Kilkenny
School, the Eton of Ireland, Berkeley came
up to Trinity College in the spring of 1700,
and at once found himself near a whirl of intellectual
life, into which he threw himself
with ardour. The influence of the discoveries
of Newton, Boyle, and Hooke, and the
speculations of Descartes, Locke, and Malebranche,
was beginning to show itself in the
University, and was gradually displacing the
old scholasticism; and the bright, clever lad
looked with eagerness towards all the new
lights which were beginning to shine upon
him. An amusing story is told of his fondness
for experiment, and his dreamy disregard
of consequences. He had gone to see
an execution, and returned pensive and melancholy,
but strangely inquisitive about the
sensations experienced by the unfortunate
criminal in the crisis of his fate. He took
counsel with an intimate college friend, Conterini,
the uncle of Oliver Goldsmith, and</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'it was agreed between them that he should
himself try the experiment, and be relieved by
his friend on a signal arranged, after which
Conterini, in his turn, was to repeat the experiment.
Berkeley was accordingly tied up
to the ceiling, and the chair removed from under
his feet. Losing consciousness, his companion
waited in vain for the signal. The enthusiastic
inquirer might have been hung in
good earnest,&mdash;and as soon as he was relieved
he fell motionless upon the floor. On recovering
himself his first words were&mdash;"Bless my
heart, Conterini, you have rumpled my band."'
</p>
</div>

<p>We need not wonder that this incident
caused Berkeley to be looked upon as an
eccentric by his fellow-students, nor that he
had to bear the usual annoyances which befall
those who get the name. With all his
eccentricity, however, he seems to have been
the centre of a company of friends, who
thought him a prodigy of learning and
amiability; and his college career was very
successful.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'He was made a Scholar in 1702. In the
spring of 1704 (the year Locke died) he became
Bachelor of Arts. He took his Master's degree
in the spring of 1707. After the customary
arduous examination of that University, conducted
in presence of nobility, gentry, and
high officials, he passed with unprecedented
applause, and was admitted to a Fellowship,
June 9, 1707, "the only reward of learning
that kingdom has to bestow," as one of his
biographers curtly says.'
</p>
</div>

<p>It is his commonplace book, however, and
the other records of his college life, now first
published, that show us how the young student
employed himself, and what were his
favourite studies and opinions. In these
early days one sees that he learned mostly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
by negation. Locke is <i>not</i> right in this particular,
Malebranche is wrong in that, More
is not to be trusted in a third,&mdash;are the most
usual entries in the young student's journal.
It is curious to look at those imperfect jottings
and see as through a window into the
eager young soul, sharpening and training
itself by living contact with the thoughts of
the great thinkers who then ruled the intellectual
world, and preparing itself to take
rank among them at some future day.
Mathematics, metaphysics, optics, physics,
and natural theology were all studied. Locke
was his great teacher, then Malebranche,
then the English Platonists; Barrow, Boyle,
Newton, and Molyneux taught him physics
and mathematics. He is always independent,
perhaps too fond of independence, perhaps
scarcely aware that as much is learned
from what we find ourselves compelled to
deny, as from what we are obliged to affirm.
There seems to have been a great deal of intellectual
life in the University, when Thomas
Prior and Samuel Madden&mdash;the two founders
of the Royal Irish Society&mdash;were fellow-students
of Berkeley, when King was translated
to the see of Dublin, and Bishop
Browne was Provost of Trinity. Berkeley
and his young friends formed themselves into
a society for the purpose of discussing the
problems which life and the new philosophy
were presenting to them. We are not told
who the members of this society were, but
we can guess, from jottings in the commonplace
book, that the subjects of discussion
were mainly suggested by portions of
Locke's essays, and we can fancy the young
metaphysicians disputing with great eagerness,
ardour, and confusion, all manner of
soluble and insoluble questions. It is more
than probable that out of the chaos of the
thoughts and opinions which must have
formed the intellectual outcome of such a
society, there gradually arose clearly and
more clearly before Berkeley the intellectual
insight into the wants and difficulties of
modern metaphysics, pure and applied,
which at last realized itself in the 'Essay towards
a New Theory of Vision,' and in the
'Principles of Human Knowledge.' At all
events we know that these two works, on
which Berkeley's fame as a metaphysician
has rested, were written and published not
many years after the date of the founding
of the College Society; and that many of
the questions discussed are to be found
among the list of subjects which Professor
Fraser thinks were there debated. Both
works everywhere show traces of the reading
and thinking which the commonplace book
reveals, and the results of the two are the
expression of the double tendency to the inductive
philosophy and to mysticism, which,
we have said, is the distinguishing feature in
Berkeley's life and philosophy. 'The Theory
of Vision' is Malebranche's seeing all things
in God, but on a rational and experimental
basis. We see God in all things, and we
see all things by means of his continual contrivance.
The outcome of the 'Principles
of Human Knowledge' is, in the main, the
attempt to explain clearly, fully, and in
accordance with Baconian principles, the
mystical thought of Norris, that God is the
immediate author of our sensations, and that
we therefore participate in Him when we
see, feel, or desire, and the doctrine of providence
on which Dr. More delighted to expatiate.</p>

<p>In 1713, we find Berkeley at the court of
Queen Anne, in company with Swift. He
had come over from Dublin chiefly for the
purpose of gaining attention for his metaphysical
system. He had endeavoured, while
in Dublin, to interest English philosophers
in his new principle, but the attempt was
not very successful. He now tried by personal
intercourse and more popular exposition,
in his Essays in the 'Guardian' and
in his Dialogues, to gain adherents to those
opinions from which he expected so much;
and in this he was pretty successful. Swift,
writing to Lord Carteret from Dublin some
years after, says that 'he (Berkeley) was a
Fellow of the University here: and going to
England very young about thirteen years
ago, he became founder of a sect called the
<i>Immaterialists</i>, by the force of a very curious
book upon that subject. Dr. Smalridge
and many other eminent persons were his
proselytes.' We have very pleasant glimpses
of the young Irish metaphysician among the
wits of Queen Anne's court. Then, as
afterwards, his amiability and enthusiasm
disarmed enmity and gained friends among
all factions. He was intimate with Steele
and Addison, as well as the companion of
Swift and Pope. Swift procured for him
the appointment of secretary to Lord Peterborough,
and in that capacity, and afterwards
as tutor to Mr. St. George Ashe, he
spent some years abroad. On his return,</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'he found London and all England in the agitation
and misery consequent upon the failure
of the South Sea Scheme. This occasioned
one of his most characteristic productions as
an author. He now addressed himself for
the first time publicly to questions of social
economy. If I am not mistaken, the deep impression
which the English catastrophe of 1720
made upon him was connected with the project
of social idealism which, as we shall see, filled
and determined his life in its middle period.'
</p>
</div>

<p>He was shocked at the tone of social morality
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
and his imaginative enthusiasm perhaps
helped to make him fancy the plague more
wide-spreading and more incurable than it
really was. His thoughts found vent in his
'Essay toward Preventing the Ruin of Great
Britain,' and he then probably first began to
meditate on the romantic scheme of missionary
enterprise which filled so much of
his life.</p>

<p>His second stay in London brought him
the beginning of many of the friendships
which lasted through life. He had met in
Italy, Benson, afterwards Bishop of Gloucester,
and now became intimate with Secker,
successively Bishop of Bristol, Bishop of
Oxford, and Archbishop of Canterbury,
Rundle, Bishop of Derry, Clarke, and Butler,&mdash;all
of whom helped him in his attempt
to realise the great plan now beginning to
take shape in his mind. He had returned
to Ireland as Chaplain to the Lord Lieutenant,
and had been nominated, in rapid succession,
Divinity Lecturer, Senior Greek
Lecturer in Trinity College, then Dean of
Dromore, then Hebrew Lecturer and Senior
Proctor in Trinity College, then Rector of
Ardtrea and Arboe, and lastly Dean of
Derry; but no sooner had he fairly obtained
the church preferment which his position
and talents had merited, than he was eager
to resign it&mdash;'his heart is ready to break if
his deanery be not taken from him.' He
wished to resign present preferment and
future prospects, and to dedicate his life,
means, and energies to instruct the youth of
America, as the President of an ideally perfect
University in the Isles of Bermuda.
The old world had grown very evil, and
Berkeley wished to make a new one. He
had mysticism enough to imagine a new
Atlantis, and the practical turn for experimenting
which made him eager to attempt
to realize it. His thoughts were not content
with the patient waiting of the mystical
medi&aelig;val piety which inspires the beautiful
'Hora Novissima' of Bernard, they must
take shape in action. His enthusiasm rises
to poetic height, and finds utterance in a few
glowing verses prophetic of the dominion
which is to come and increase on the other
side of the ocean by the diffusion of education,
the sciences, and the preaching of the
Word:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'Westward the course of empire takes its way;</p>
<p class="i1">The four first Acts already past.</p>
<p>A fifth shall close the Drama with the day:</p>
<p class="i1">Time's noblest offspring is the last.'</p>
</div>

<p>After much anxious waiting and painful
pleading at court and with Parliament,
Berkeley at last obtained a charter for his
college, and was promised an endowment
of &pound;20,000:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'The Charter authorized the erection of a
college in the Bermudas to be called the College
of St. Paul, and to be governed by a President
and nine Fellows who were to form the Corporation.
Berkeley was named the first President,
and his three Dublin associates the first
Fellows. They were all allowed to retain their
preferments at home for eighteen months after
their arrival in the islands. Other six Fellows
were to be appointed by them within three
years, and the surviving members of the Corporation
were to have power to elect all the future
vacancies. The Bishop of London was named
as Visitor, and the Secretary of State for the
Colonies was appointed Chancellor. The College
was declared to be for the instruction of
students in literature and theology, with a
view to the promotion of Christian civilization
alike in the English and in the heathen parts of
America.'
</p>
</div>

<p>He sailed from Gravesend with his newly-married
wife and a little company of retainers
and friends, and arrived in the Narragansett
waters, on the western side of Rhode
Island, at the beautiful harbour of Newport.
Berkeley had meant to call at Rhode
Island on his way to the Bermudas to get
information, procure anything needful for
the fulfilment of his great scheme, purchase
land as an investment for his college, and
perhaps gain the good-will and interest of
friendly New Englanders. He was not destined
to get nearer the Bermudas. The
visit, which was originally meant to be a
short one, lengthened out from month to
month, until at last Berkeley began to like
the place so well that he confidentially says
to Prior in one of his letters:&mdash;'The truth
is, if the king's bounty were paid in, and
the charter could be removed hither, I should
like it better than Bermuda.' And Newport
would have made a very good centre
for his scheme of educational and evangelical
operations. It was the capital of the
State of Rhode Island, and was a rich centre
of foreign and domestic trade. The
State had been colonized by Roger Williams
in 1636, and had a constitution which asserted
the right of religious freedom while
that was still unknown in every other State
in America. Its society was accordingly
very unlike that met with almost anywhere
else. Quakers, Moravians, Jews, Episcopalians,
Congregationalists, Independents, and
Baptists of every sect, all lived together,
holding their own beliefs, and tolerating
those of their neighbours. The town population
was chiefly mercantile, while that of
the interior of the island, and that along the
Narragansett shore, was pastoral. The inhabitants
were famed for their hospitality,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
and the society was intelligent and well-informed.
Great care was taken of the education
of the children, and the libraries and
pictures which still remain testify to the
good taste and culture of the gentlemen of
the island:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'The Rhode Island aristocracy of Berkeley's
time maintained the character of the old English
country gentlemen from whom they were
descended. A state of society supported by
slavery produced festivity. Tradition records
the genial life of those days in the colony.
Excursions to Hartford to luxuriate on bloated
salmon were annual indulgences in May. Pace
races on the beach for silver tankards were the
social indulgences of summer. When autumn
arrived, there were harvest-home festivities.
Large numbers of both sexes gathered on those
occasions&mdash;gentlemen in their scarlet coats and
swords, with lace ruffles over their hands, silk
stockings, and shoes ornamented with silver
buckles, and ladies dressed in brocade, with
high-heeled shoes and high head-dresses.
These festivities would sometimes continue for
days, and they were shared by the slaves as
well as their masters. Christmas was the
great festival of the year; twelve days were
then given to hospitalities. The wedding, too,
was a great gala in the olden time. And the
fox chase, with hounds and horns, as well as
fishing and fowling, were favourite sports in
Narragansett.'
</p>
</div>

<p>While in Newport, Berkeley mingled in
the society of the town, and frequently
preached in the pulpit of Mr. Honeyman, a
missionary of the Church of England. He
visited the Narragansett country, and is said
to have made some distant excursions to see
the condition of the native Indian tribes. A
few months after his arrival he bought a farm
and built a commodious house, which he called
Whitehall. The house is still standing, and
is known in the neighbourhood as Bishop
Berkeley's house. Few situations could be
more adapted to the tastes of a student as
fond of nature as of books. It was here
that 'Alciphron,' the most elaborate, and,
in the lifetime of the author, the most popular,
of all Berkeley's writings, was written.
Tradition points to a natural alcove in the
rocks, commanding a view of the beach and
the ocean, as the spot where the beautiful
dialogues were composed.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'"Alciphron" is redolent of the fragrance of
nature in Rhode Island and of the invigorating
breezes of its ocean shore. Smith of Philadelphia,
in his preface to the London edition
of Johnson of Stratford's philosophical works,
says that one day when visiting him Johnson
took up the book, and reading some of Berkeley's
rural descriptions, told him that they
were copied from the charming landscapes in
that delightful island, which lay before him at
the time he was writing.'
</p>
</div>

<p>While living this retired life at Whitehall
and troubled with anxieties at the delays
which prevented him from seeing the actual
realization of his great scheme, Berkeley
found time to mingle in the intellectual society
which Newport afforded, and took the
lead in forming a philosophical association
for the discussion of speculative questions.
One of the objects of this association was to
collect books, and it originated the Redwood
Library, which still exists in Newport, a
memento of the short but interesting stay of
Bishop Berkeley.</p>

<p>One American friend, however, is more
closely related to Berkeley than any other,
and must not be passed over without special
mention. This was Dr. Samuel Johnson,
the Episcopalian minister of Stratford. He
had known the 'Principles of Human Knowledge'
before Berkeley's arrival in America,
and had become a convert to the metaphysical
opinions there set forth. He was one of
the first to welcome Berkeley when he
landed in Rhode Island, and the friendship
and correspondence which then began only
ceased with the death of the Bishop. His
name, too, possesses special interest to all
students of Berkeley's philosophy, and he
must be held in honour as one of the earliest
and one of the greatest metaphysicians
which America has produced. Although
his works have been forgotten&mdash;obscured, perhaps,
by the theological and metaphysical fame
of his great pupil, Jonathan Edwards&mdash;they
still deserve attention. We should like to
see a new edition of his 'Elementa Philosophica;'
and believe that, if re-published and
known, it would be a valuable contribution
to American philosophy. This work possesses
a special interest for the student of
Berkeley. It was written by a professed
disciple, was the result of the study of
Berkeley's writings, of conversations and
correspondence with him on the philosophical
subjects it discusses. It was dedicated
to the Bishop, and may almost be looked
upon as a new and more complete edition of
the 'Principles of Human Knowledge.' It
treats of the pure intellect and its notions,
and of the intuitive intellectual light; and
so, to some extent, supplies the place of the
second part of that work which was never
written, and connects the philosophy of
Berkeley's earlier days with the Platonic
mysticism of his old age. Johnson's 'Elementa
Philosophica' can never be separated
from Berkeley's 'Principles of Human
Knowledge;' and had the two been always
studied together, the continual misapprehension
of the Bishop's philosophical system,
which has characterized most histories of
philosophy, could scarcely have arisen. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
philosophical letters to Johnson are also full
of interest, and show other sides of Berkeley's
system than that most prominent in the
'Principles of Human Knowledge;' and
Johnson himself seems to have had no small
influence in developing what, in some respects,
may be called the idealist,<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> and in others the
mystical moment in Berkeley's speculation.</p>

<p>While thus employed in philosophical
correspondence and composition, and in
social and intellectual intercourse with his
friends in and near Newport, Berkeley was
harassed with doubts and anxieties about
the success of his great scheme. He had
embarked in the faith that Sir R. Walpole
would fulfil his promise, and that the
&pound;20,000 endowment which had been voted
by Parliament would be soon handed over
to him for his college. But the long months
spent in waiting lengthened out to years, and
the prospect grew duller and duller, until at
length even Berkeley began to despair. Dr.
Gibson, Bishop of London, who had been
appointed by the charter the Visitor of the
new University, did all he could to forward
the scheme; and when he found that the
ministerial delays were only meant to cover
the non-fulfilment of their bargain, he at last
got a conclusive answer from Walpole: 'If
you put this question to me as a minister,'
said he, 'I must and can assure you that the
money shall most undoubtedly be paid as
soon as suits with public convenience; but
if you ask me, as a friend, whether Dean
Berkeley should continue in America expecting
the payment of &pound;20,000, I advise him
by all means to return home to Europe, and
give up his present expectations.'</p>

<p>The ten best years of Berkeley's life were
given to this scheme of missionary enterprise,
and now it ended in what seemed to be utter
failure. We have only to read his enthusiastic
letters to his friend Prior to see how
hopefully he had looked forward to the future,
and to realize how crushing the blow must
have been which now fell upon him. He bore
himself bravely enough, however, outwardly,
and his own account of the miscarriage given
in 'Alciphron' does not reveal very much
depression:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'I flattered myself, <i>Theages</i>, that before this
time I might have been able to have sent you
an agreeable account of the success of the
affair which brought me into this remote corner
of the country. But, instead of this, I
should now give you the detail of its miscarriage,
if I did not rather choose to entertain you
with some amusing incidents, which have helped
to make me easy under a circumstance I
could neither obviate nor foresee. Events are
not in our power; but it always is, to make a
good use even of the very worst. And I must
needs own, the course and event of this affair
gave opportunity for reflections that make me
some amends for a great loss of time, pains,
and expense. A life of action, which takes its
issue from the counsels, passions, and views
of other men, if it doth not draw a man to
imitate, will at least teach him to observe.
And a mind at liberty to reflect on its own
observations, if it produce nothing useful in
the world, seldom fails of entertainment to
itself. For several months past I have enjoyed
such liberty and leisure in this distant retreat,
far beyond the verge of that great whirlpool
of business, faction, and pleasure which
is called the world. And a retreat in itself
agreeable, after a long scene of trouble and
disquiet, was made much more so by the conversation
and good qualities of my host Euphranor,
who unites in his own person the
philosopher and the farmer, two characters not
so inconsistent in nature as by custom they
seem to be.'
</p>
</div>

<p>But Berkeley felt that his life-work was
done. He felt himself to be a broken man,
so far as action was concerned. The practical-working
experimental side of his nature
falls into the shade; and the calm mystical
enthusiasm which spends itself in study and
in reverie, and can turn from the vexations
and disturbances and wrongs of the real
world to find repose and quietude in the
contemplation of the world of ideal perfection
visioned in the dreams of genius, grows
stronger and stronger. He returned to England
in the end of 1731, and soon found
himself among old acquaintances. Church
preferment awaited him. He was nominated
to the rich deanery of Down, and when the
nomination was from accidental circumstances
cancelled, was soon afterwards nominated
and consecrated Bishop of Cloyne.
But he did not mingle much in society, nor
take a very active part in the business of
life. He more and more preferred to live in
quiet seclusion. A wealthier bishopric was
within his reach, but he contented himself
with Cloyne. The offer of the Primacy of
Ireland failed to draw him from his retirement.
A growing feebleness, a love for
quietness, and increasing and constant ill-health,
all show how heavily the great disappointment
of his life pressed upon him. He
was not fifty when he was made Bishop of
Cloyne, but all that he did afterwards bears
the stamp of old age.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span></p>

<p>The American enterprise, however, was
not such a failure as it seemed to Berkeley.
His one great practical enterprise bears a
curious analogy to his philosophical system.
His life-work and his life-thought are strangely
parallel. In both there is the combination
of shrewd, practical judgment, with almost
visionary enthusiasm. Both were thought
by his contemporaries to be more suitable
for a dream-life than for waking reality.
Both fail in completeness of development
and adequacy of expression; and yet both
contain in them germs of life to be long
afterwards developed. Berkeley's American
scheme did not entirely break down at his
return to England. The farm of Whitehall,
which he had bought near Newport, he bequeathed
to Yale College for the purpose of
encouraging Greek and Latin scholarship,
and the list of Berkeleian scholars&mdash;a list
containing more than two hundred names,
among them some of the most eminent in
America&mdash;shows how far the designs of the
founder were thus unexpectedly fulfilled:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'"It is a fact of no slight significance," the
writer remarks, "taken in connection with the
original purpose of Berkeley, that of this list
nearly one hundred are marked as ministers of
the Gospel, foremost among whom is President
Wheelock, who founded an Indian school, the
germ of Dartmouth College; while hundreds
more, not here enumerated, have been recipients
of this bounty, in the shape of smaller
premiums, among whom may be named David
Brainerd, the 'Apostle to the Indians.'"'
</p>
</div>

<p>Berkeley's gifts to Yale College did not
cease with the bequest of his farm. He so
interested some of his Bermuda subscribers
in the American College that, with their aid,
he was able to send over from England a
large donation of books to its library. Harvard
College, as well as Yale, received gifts
of books, and, to the end of his life, Berkeley's
constant references in his letters to
Johnson, and his continual kindnesses and
recommendations of young American students
who from time to time came over to
England, showed the deep interest which he
took in the cause of religion and education
in the Western hemisphere.</p>

<p>The Cloyne life was a very retired one,
and Berkeley was almost as much, if not
more out of the world there than he had
been at Newport. His intercourse with old
friends was mostly by letter. Secker, the
Bishop of Bristol, and Benson, Bishop of
Gloucester, are still the most valued correspondents
among the friends of his later life.
Gibson, Bishop of London, writes in dignified
style about public events, and about the
analyst controversy. Prior, his old school
and college companion, is still his most useful
friend, eager and ready as ever to take
up and defend any one of his theories or
fancies. Dean Gervais writes and receives
beautiful letters about Cloyne and foreign
politics. These were stirring times abroad.
Frederick the Great was in Silesia, and even
a student recluse cannot help thinking that
'We live in an age of revolutions so sudden
and surprising in all parts of Europe, that I
question whether the like has been ever
known before.' Protestant clergymen were
very much afraid of France governed by old
Cardinal Fleury, but the excitement did not
last long, and only reawakened when the
next post-bag arrived. The letters from
Cloyne give us beautiful glimpses into
Berkeley's home-life. There are musical
parties, and country visits, village charities,
and small attempts at the introduction of
manufactures, and his student life in his
diocese was not entirely that of a recluse.
Even at this period of his life, Berkeley's
sympathies were active enough to lead him
to undertake a somewhat long and tedious
study of the causes of Irish distress and
poverty, and more particularly of the famine
and epidemic of 1741-2. The results of his
investigations were published in the 'Querist'
and in 'Siris.'</p>

<p>The 'Querist' was originally published in
three parts. It consists of a series of queries
concerning the state of Ireland and the remedies
suggested. It is a remarkable book,
and very little known; still more remarkable
when we consider that it was written in
1735 by a bishop of the Irish Church Establishment.
The central thought is expressed
in the pregnant query, 'Whether a scheme
for the welfare of the Irish nation should not
take in the whole inhabitants; and whether
it be not a vain attempt to project the
flourishing of our Protestant gentry, exclusive
of the bulk of the natives?'&mdash;and the
introduction of manufactures, a national
bank, the admission of Roman Catholics
into Trinity College, Dublin, without compelling
them to attend chapel or divinity
lectures, and the election of Roman Catholics
as justices of the peace, are some of the
means of realizing such a scheme. Berkeley's
belief in the healing powers of tar-water
is better known, and his efforts to get
it recognised as a panacea scarcely require
mention. They occupied no small part of
his last years in Cloyne.</p>

<p>During these last years we hear occasionally
of an 'Oxford Scheme,' and there are
traces in Berkeley's correspondence of efforts
made to give up his bishopric for the sake of
some minor preferment not requiring residence.
The education of his sons and his
own imaginative desire for a 'life academico-philosophical'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
seem to have been the motives.
In August, 1752, he left Cloyne, and was not
destined to see it again. The journey was
more than his weakened body could bear.
'He was so much reduced by suffering that
he had to be carried from his landing on the
English shore, in a horse litter to Oxford.'
He did not linger long in the beautiful University
city in the enjoyment of a life to
which he had so often looked forward, and
during the months of his residence was
almost withdrawn from society by disease
and suffering. He was not altogether idle,
however.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'In October, 1752, "A Miscellany containing
several Tracts on various Subjects, by the Bishop
of Cloyne," was published simultaneously in
London and Dublin. With one exception, the
Miscellany was a reprint of works previously
published. But the old ardour was not extinguished.
It contains also, "Further Thoughts
on Tar-water," written probably during his
last months at Cloyne; and prefixed to the
Miscellany is a copy of Latin verses addressed
to him by an English prelate on that absorbing
enthusiasm of his old age.</p>

<p>'A third edition of "Alciphron," of which I
have given a minute account elsewhere, was
also published at this time. It is chiefly remarkable
for its omission of those sections in
the Seventh Dialogue which contain a defence
of what has been called his Nominalism.'
</p>
</div>

<p>The end was drawing near, and came
almost unexpectedly. Professor Fraser tells
us that</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'The autumn and winter of 1752 wore passing
away, as we may fancy, in that enjoyment
of academic repose which was possible in weakness
of body more or less disturbed by acute
suffering. We are here left to fancy. One
actual scene has alone been preserved. On the
evening of Sunday, the 14th of January, 1753,
Berkeley was resting on a couch, in his house
in Holywell-street, surrounded by his family.
His wife had been reading aloud to the little
family party the lesson in the Burial Service,
taken from the fifteenth chapter of the first
epistle to the Corinthians, and he had been making
remarks upon that sublime passage. His
daughter soon after went to offer him some tea.
She found him, as it seemed, asleep, but his
body was already cold; for it was the last
sleep&mdash;the mystery of death; and the world of
the senses had suddenly ceased to be a medium
of intercourse between his spirit and those who
remained. "Although all possible means," we
are told, "were used, not the least symptom of
life ever afterwards appeared."'
</p>
</div>

<p>And so one of the greatest and of the purest
thinkers that England has ever seen passed
away to his rest.</p>

<p>The philosophy of Berkeley is not so much
a theory of matter as a philosophy of causality;
and the great service which Professor
Fraser has done to the history of philosophy
is that he has so far made it clear that the
one important contribution which Berkeley
has brought to the stock of knowledge, the
one doctrine of his which has been most
fruitful, and most pregnant with results to
after-philosophy, is his explanation of the
word cause, and the place which he assigns
to causality. Berkeley's polemic against abstract
ideas, his theories of vision, and his
discussions about the nature of ideas, are
all subsidiary to this one great doctrine of
the meaning and place of causality. It does
occur to us that Professor Fraser, while
keeping this clearly before him in his admirable
elucidations, by prefaces and notes, has
somewhat obscured it by dwelling at such
length on the points of similarity between
Berkeley and Reid and Hamilton. These
Scottish philosophers struggled after a theory
of matter from the beginning to the end;
the reality of the external world, as if anybody
ever questioned it, was their alpha and
omega. They could think and write of
scarcely anything else. But Berkeley's philosophy
was a great deal deeper and wider.
It was free from what we may perhaps call
the provincialism of the Scottish school,
which clung with tenacity to what was after
all a very small strip in the wide dominion of
philosophy, and could never free itself from
the narrowness which such exclusiveness was
sure to beget. His philosophical writings,
containing new and striking thoughts, some
of them only now bearing fruit, upon
the great metaphysical problems of universals,
substance, causality, and the organism of
the universe, cannot without danger of misconception
be compared at length with a
system which thinks itself competent to classify
all metaphysical systems according as
they contain some one or other theory of
perception. We repeat, then, Berkeley's
philosophy is by no means merely a theory
of matter or a doctrine of sense-perception&mdash;it
is a philosophy of causality&mdash;of substance
and causality if you will, but of substance
as subordinate to causality.</p>

<p>We are quite aware that these views
regarding Berkeley's philosophy have not
met with general acceptance. The great proportion
of Berkeley's critics, roughly speaking,
may be set in two classes: those who
believe that his theory is utter scepticism,
which the first breath of common sense dissipates,
and those who believe the Bishop's
opinions to be harmless, because quite unimportant.
Dr. Johnson kicks a stone, and
Berkeley's theory is disproved. Dr. Reid
runs his head against a lamp-post, and with
the same important philosophical result.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'For mock-turtle make me sup sensations.'
</p>
</div>

<p>The grave criticisms and arguments of many
of Berkeley's opponents rest on the same
basis. On the other hand, Hegel looks down
loftily upon the whole affair, and pronounces
the philosophy and its criticism a mere play
upon words. Berkeley says <i>without</i> is <i>within</i>.
Be it so. He has done nothing to settle
the problem of philosophy, which remains
as before. It may help to bring out more
clearly what we believe to be a juster estimate
of the nature and value of the speculations
of Bishop Berkeley, if we shortly summarize
these two different modes of criticizing
his system as they appear in their latest
form.</p>

<p>Thus it is said, on the one hand, when we
look at any object we feel compelled to assert
that we see it to be of a certain colour;
but this assertion, we afterwards find, must
be compatible with two facts&mdash;that the same
object has different colours as seen by the same
person from different points of view, and
also as seen by different persons at the same
time. Yet we stand by our conviction, that
we do see the same thing, because it is our
conviction that we do see it. If we were
not to stand by it under these circumstances,
we could never stand by such natural convictions
at any time. The whole evidence
for the system is that visible objects look of
different sizes and colours at different distances,
and in different lights; while the arguments
against the theory are the primary
convictions of men.<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, a recent German critic
says that the reason why Berkeley's theory
has been so little approved of, not only
by the great public of those who are capable
of reflection, but also by those who are philosophers
by profession, is that it is not
at all in advance of common opinion; for
Berkeley was not the first to declare that the
apple which is seen and felt, is only seen
and felt, or is phenomenal. This assertion is
as old as philosophy. Most philosophers,
however, in opposition to Berkeley, have
thought, and still think, that the fundamental
cause of the phenomena which brings it about
is not merely phenomenal, but something
quite different. This hypothesis is not without
its difficulties. We cannot explain how
a motion in the nerves becomes a sensation
which we are conscious of. But Berkeley's
theory does not better the position. He cannot
show how it happens that the divine objective
'ideas' become one human subjective
perception or intuition; he does not tell us
how God enables us to share or represent
His thoughts, since He neither speaks to us
nor writes to us. Berkeley cannot, from his
point of view, show with any certainty where
the truth lies in the different opinions of men
upon the orderly coherence of the phenomenal
world, the relation of phenomenal
things to each other, upon the ground
and purpose of human existence, &amp;c. In
short, he is as little able to found a scientific
knowledge and a theory of knowledge upon
his hypothesis as the common opinion of man
can on its presupposition. His whole system
is only a change of position without result.
It explains nothing, helps us in nothing&mdash;it
is no philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>We have chosen these two representations,
not because they are the best, but simply because
they are the latest.</p>

<p>All such criticisms proceed upon the supposition
that the whole of the philosophy of
Berkeley is summed up in the 'Principles of
Human Knowledge,' and do not even take
the trouble to investigate the history of
the opinions advanced in that unfinished and
imperfect treatise. They do not know the
philosophical importance of the Theory
of Vision, the correspondence between
Johnson and Berkeley, nor the Platonism or
Neo-Platonism of 'Siris.' The publication
of a complete edition of Berkeley's writings
ought itself to render such criticism impossible,
and the elucidations supplied by Professor
Fraser should make them less excusable.
A philosophical critic can scarcely now proceed
on the presupposition that the 'Principles
of Human Knowledge' and the Dialogues
are the full and finished results of
Berkeley's speculations, and take it upon him
to neglect all else in his critique.<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> He must
now recognise that it is not so easy to sum
up Berkeley's principles; that we are in the
same position for judging him as we would
be with regard to Leibnitz if the 'Monadologie'
and the 'Nouveaux Essais' had never
been written; that we have a series of
treatises, each more unfinished than the
other, from which the latent developing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
thoughts have to be gathered as much by
reference to history and life as by actual reference
to their pages. He must recognise
that there is a discernible unity in his life
and speculations&mdash;a unity which may be
traced throughout all Berkeley's writings,
and which reconciles the Theory of Vision
with 'Siris,' the Preface to the 'Principles,'
&amp;c., with the cancelling of the pages on Nominalism
in the last edition of the 'Alciphron.'</p>

<p>Berkeley's whole philosophy is a combination
of two currents of speculation&mdash;that
of Locke on the one hand, and that of the
English mystics on the other. In his earlier
writings the influence of Locke is predominant,
but gradually loses power until at last
it almost succumbs to the influence of the
Platonists; but, from first to last, we have
the attempt to combine what is real and
deep and true in the old spiritual philosophy
with the clearness, consistency, and relation
to physical science which Nominalism
and the Baconian method can bring.</p>

<p>Berkeley seeks, in metaphysics, direct spiritual
intuition; in physics, to abolish what
would prevent this intuition. The mystics
from whom Berkeley had learned so much
had built their system of philosophy upon
such an intuition, and made it their one
thing needful. But their spiritual intuition
was an intuition which was said to be enjoyed
in meditations and trances, not in life
and work. The world of things seen and
handled did not bring them into direct communion
with spirit; it was rather a veil to
cloud the vision, a clog to hinder the endeavour
of the human spirit ever trying to
get beyond it. The senses and sense-knowledge
were despised, and only behind the
veil which it hung athwart the soul was
there that universe of things unseen and
eternal which More and Norris delighted to
expatiate upon; or, if the senses did in any
dim and uncertain way reveal the invisible
spiritual realities longed for, it was because
the soul, rising above them, put a divine
meaning into them, and revelled in the 'lusciousness
of this inward sense.' Such a
hazy, unreal way of conceiving the spirit-life
which he believed to be the true reality,
was distasteful to Berkeley. He wished to
keep to the spiritual intuition, which was the
one good thing in these mystical doctrines,
but he wished to bring it out of dreamland,
and make it serviceable for every-day work
and endeavour. Both More and Norris
dreamt of an Atlantis, and celebrated its
praises in prose and verse; Berkeley set sail
for America to create the Utopia he had
visioned. More and Norris could only realise
the spiritual intuition on which they
based their philosophy in an ecstatic contemplation,
when the soul is borne on the
wings of meditation far beyond this world
of sensible things; Berkeley employs his
spiritual intuition to account for puzzles in
vision, errors in mathematics, and the virtues
of tar-water. He wishes to mould and
fashion, to give clearness and distinctness
of outline to the spiritual beliefs and intuitions
of the mystics by applying to them the
<i>method</i> of Locke and Bacon. He wishes to
conserve and give value to the fundamental
truths which lie unshaped in the scholastic
Realism, by applying to them the clearness
and methods of Nominalism. This is, we
believe, the key to Berkeley's life and philosophy.</p>

<p>Let us try to show its application.</p>

<p>The English mystics were the reaction
against a phase of the new philosophy
which had been so developed by Hobbes as
to create a strong counter opinion. This
phase was the doctrine of an inert matter
which is so prominent in the writings of
Descartes and Geulinx&mdash;matter, whose distinguishing
characteristic was extension,
which was entirely void of all power to act
or to influence, and which was set up in opposition
to spirit, whose distinguishing characteristic
or property was consciousness.
This theory of matter was so void of all
real meaning that the existence and properties
of material substance became gradually
of less importance in a system of philosophy,
and at length, as in Malebranche and
Norris, ceased to have any influence on
their speculations. It was outside their
system, and of little or no account in its
explanation. Yet the very semblance of its
presence prevented a thorough-going attempt
to explain the real meaning of reality,
power, and causality, and recourse is
had to meditation and ecstasy instead of to
philosophical explanation and analysis.
Locke's philosophy, on the other hand, with
its calm, experimental analysis of the facts
of knowledge, and its concentration of effort
upon the senses and the knowledge they
supplied, had brought the mind of man
back to facts, and pointed to another path
than that of vision or ecstasy, by which one
might ascend to the understanding of what
is meant by the world of things known and
knowable. But if Locke is always judicious,
he is never deep. He solved the
theory of substance more by ignoring than
by explaining it; and his Atomism, if one
may call it so&mdash;his assertion that all knowledge
is of particulars, and particulars only&mdash;not
only turned him aside from any complete
statement of causality, but forced him
into theories of abstract ideas or conceptions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
that seem inconsistent with his own
principles. When Locke had to account
for the fact that this, that, and the other,
sensation of colour were felt to be the same,
he explains away this seeming contradiction
to his favourite doctrine that all knowledge
is of particulars, by saying that there
is an abstract idea of whiteness framed
from the particular ideas or sensations. But
the necessities of language, thought, and
science require that this abstract idea of
whiteness must be as often, if not oftener,
before the mind than any one of the particular
ideas out of which it has been constructed,
and thus the abstract idea is much
more important than the particular sensation.
When Locke is called on to give an
account of our knowledge and its origin, his
Atomism is always brought forward; when
he wishes to speak of truth, certainty, &amp;c.,
he cannot help paying more attention to abstract
ideas. He thus figures two worlds
just as the mystics had done, the sensible
and intelligible, and while elevating the
worth of the former, is inclined to make certainty,
demonstration, &amp;c., belong to the
latter.</p>

<p>Locke's theory of abstract ideas was an
hypothesis to account for and explain a
really objective knowledge&mdash;that is, a knowledge
which is true for others as well as for
the individual. Objectivity, in this simple
sense of the word, was a great difficulty in
Locke's system. He had reduced all our
ideas to ideas of sense and of reflection. He
had insisted on the purely subjective origin
of whatever is known. And at the same
time he had insisted that what was known
in this way were particular things and particulars
only. He seems both in his account
of the origin of knowledge, and in his
description of the things known, to exclude
the possibility of a knowledge common to
several individuals at once. Each man
seems rather to be shut within the sphere of
his own ideas of sense and reflection about
certain particular objects. But a subjective
theory of knowledge and things known cannot
be maintained. It would render all
social intercourse impossible. There could
be neither language, propositions, nor even
common nouns. And the theory of abstract
ideas is the way out of the difficulty.
Now Berkeley, with his strong spiritual intuition,
regarded Locke's system of abstract
ideas very much as Aristotle, with his strong
faith in progressive motion towards a final
end (<span class="greek" title="telos">&#964;&#949;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>), looked at Plato's ideal theory.
It was only reproduction, a shadowy
reflection, a cold crystallization of
the world of sense ideas, and really did
nothing to explain the life, motion, and
order of the sense-world, nor furnished
us with a basis for our real common
or objective knowledge. We do not
think that Berkeley altogether appreciated
Locke, nor fully recognised the use which
he, as well as Hobbes, had made of the doctrine
of association of ideas, to explain community
of knowledge and objective certainty.
For in Hobbes and Locke we see the
beginnings of that modern psychological
theory which, under the names of association
of ideas and relativity of knowledge,
explain the existence, permanence, and objectivity
of things and classes of things by a
manifold flow of phenomena. Ideas or sensations,
by rubbing themselves against consciousness,
in various ways coalesce into
things, and things into those possibilities of
reproduction, intercourse, and communion
which are represented by common nouns.
But Berkeley had been taught by the mystics
to associate motion, cause, and sensation
with spirit or mind, and he could not see
that Locke's doctrine of association, so void
of conscious life or personal activity, might
at least prove so nearly allied to his own
doctrine of causality that it might be called
its external wrapping. And even if Berkeley
had seen this, we may excuse him from
acknowledging what he owed to Locke in
this matter, and forcing into prominence, in
opposition to Locke's teaching, his intuition
of direct spiritual agency, when we find how
the association theory has not freed us from
the abstractions which Berkeley dreaded,
but still gives us such shadowy conceptions
as the 'unconditioned' of Hamilton, or the
'unknown cause' of Mill. Berkeley admired
Locke, and studied him carefully.
His great aim was to keep Locke's results,
to retain Locke's philosophy, but to give it
new life. His philosophy was to be Lockianism
stript of its notionalism, and inspired
in all its parts by that direct spiritual intuition
which was never absent from his
mind. It was to be Locke's philosophy,
with these differences: the starting-point
of the system was to be the human self&mdash;the
conscious <i>ego</i>&mdash;the type of all subsistence:
and an association theory producing a
second world of abstract ideas was to be
supplanted by the continuous active causality
of personal spirits; or, more shortly, it
was to be Locke's philosophy, with living
personal causality put instead of abstract
ideas.<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span></p>

<p>If we take this as the fundamental thought
in Berkeley's speculation we find three stages
of development in his philosophy. In his
'Common-place Book,' and in the 'Principles,'
he fancies, in his youthful fervour, that
he has only to strip Locke's philosophy of
its notionalism and the true system of metaphysics
will appear. Hence his speculation
in this first period is mainly negative. It is
a war against abstractions, and his positive
theories are more hinted at than explained.
The second period is revealed in his philosophical
letters to Dr. Samuel Johnson. He
begins to find that there is more to be done
in philosophy than to extirpate abstract
ideas, and inquires into the archetypes of
things. The third period is given us in
'Siris.' His philosophy has got deeper and
perhaps less dogmatic. He was won to the
grand thought of an organic universe of
things, in which their whole is made for all
the parts, and every part for the whole, and
for the other parts; so that the virtues of
tar-water are intimately connected by a multiform
concatenation with the constant presence
and continual agency of the God in
whom we live and move and have our being.
The first period in Berkeley's speculation
is, as we have said, mainly negative. It is a
polemic against abstract ideas in their various
forms. The attack is earnest, eager, but
also impatient and inadequate. We have
only hints at construction. It seems as if he
thought he had only to deny false modes of
explanation in order to state the right one,
and his discussion throughout bears the stamp
of eagerness and impetuosity. It represents
the man who could say of those who doubted
the success of his American enterprise,
'that small-minded persons had a talent for
objections.' This period is represented in
the 'New Theory of Vision,' 'The Principles
of Human Knowledge,' and 'The Dialogues
between Hylas and Philonous.' Its
negative character may be due to accident.
These three works are confessedly an imperfect
sketch of Berkeley's principles. The
'Theory of Vision' is a mere tentative introduction;
the 'Principles,' as we have them,
are only the first part of a work which, if
we are to trust 'The Common-place Book,'
was meant to include three parts, and was
published as Part I. The 'Dialogues' are
only the 'reproduction of the first part of the
'Principles of Human Knowledge.' They
are all of them imperfect expositions of
Berkeley's speculative opinion. Taking
them as they are, however, let us endeavour
to discover the fundamental thoughts in
each.</p>

<p>It has been for some time acknowledged
that the essay towards A New Theory of
Vision is not to be summed up in the dictum
that distance is invisible. The invisibility
of distance is the psychological basis of the
theory.<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> The work is rather the first blow
in the attack upon Locke's 'Doctrine of
Abstract Ideas':&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'The treatise is, in short, a professed account
count of the facts, the whole facts, and nothing
but the facts, of which we are visually
conscious, as distinguished from pretended
facts and metaphysical abstractions, which
confused thought, an irregular exercise of imagination,
or an abuse of words had substituted
for them.'
</p>
</div>

<p>The question which Berkeley really asks
is&mdash;How do we universalize our ideas of
sight? The proper objects of sight are
light and colours. How, then, do we see distance,
figure, size, situation, magnitude and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
solidity? How can the sensation of green
colour peculiar to my mind stand for, not
the mere sense-blur of vague green colour,
but an oval leaf fluttering in the wind some
twenty feet above me, attached to the twig
of a beech tree! and, moreover, how can
this sensation which belongs to me so far
belong to others that the same knowledge
conveyed to me is also given to them? How
can the vague subjective sensation be universalized
so that it stands for several things
not felt, and more especially for sensations
of touch? What is the link between these
various qualities? What is the bridge by
which the mind passes over from the one to
the other? This link is <i>not</i>, says Berkeley,
an <i>abstract idea</i> of extension, in which the
visible and tangible sensations unite, for
there is no such idea. The sensations of
sight and of touch are on their side quite
heterogeneous:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'The extension, figures, and motions perceived
by sight are specifically distinct from
the ideas of touch, called by the same names;
nor is there any such thing as one idea, or kind
of idea, common to both senses.'
</p>
</div>

<p>Light and colour are the immediate objects
of sight, and they constitute a species
entirely distinct from the ideas of touch.
No one would think of adding a visible foot
to a tangible foot; and the experience of
persons born blind and recovering their sight
points to a certain confusedness in apprehending
the connection between the two
sets of ideas which would not occur if they
belonged to one and the same abstract idea
of extension. If we would explain the
fact that ideas may so be universalized that
they stand for ideas of touch, we must rather
bring them under the living power of
mind which, grasping the two together, makes
the one the sign of the other. When we have
the sensation of the colour greenness, we
see a green leaf of a small oval shape, not
because the colour is necessarily connected
with the size and shape, nor because all
three inhere as qualities in an abstract idea
of extension, but because:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'Light and colours, with their several shades
and degrees, all which being infinitely diversified
and combined, deform a language wonderfully
adapted to suggest and exhibit to us the
distances, figures, situations, dimensions, and
various qualities of tangible objects&mdash;not by
similitude, nor yet by inference of necessary
connection, but by the arbitrary imposition of
Providence, just as words suggest the things
signified by them.'
</p>
</div>

<p>There is no abstract idea which corresponds
now to the sensations of sight, now
to the sensations of touch; the connecting
link is supplied by the unifying action of
the human mind, which seizes upon the one
idea and makes it the sign of the others, and
this one idea is fitted to be the sign of the
others not by any similarity or peculiar fitness
on its side, but because of its position
in the flow of phenomena given to it and
preserved for it by the living spiritual causality
which creates and arranges everything.
The ideas of sense are universalized, scientific
and objective knowledge is possible, we
can go from ideas of sight to those of touch,
and back again from those of touch to those
of sight, because of a double spiritual influence&mdash;the
active living influence of mind
outside, permeating, creating, and associating
all things, and the partly passive, partly
active ingathering influence of the individual
human mind within, interpreting, arranging,
according to the associations imposed upon
them and lying undeveloped in them, the
vague <i>blurs</i> of sensation. Berkeley's thought
is almost the same as Schleiermacher's, that
all scientific knowledge is the joint product
of an internal and an external factor&mdash;organic
function and the external world,&mdash;which
factors are universally related to each
other; only, according to Berkeley's spiritual
intuition, everywhere present; the living
centre of organic function is the partly passive,
partly active influence of the human
self, while the living centre of the external
factor is the supreme mind without us continuously
creating and arranging.</p>

<p>The Principles of Human Knowledge
follow up the attack on abstract ideas made
in the New Theory of Vision. The introduction,
with its attack on Conceptualism,<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
prepares the way for a more sweeping assault
on abstractions. Now Berkeley almost invariably
attacks a general question by making
an assault on one special form which it
takes. His method is borrowed from Locke,
who shows that all our ideas may be reduced
to ideas of sensation and reflection by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
selecting one or two most unlikely to
conform to such a reduction, and proving
by analysis that they do. Berkeley
begins to attack the Lockian doctrine of
abstract ideas by showing that there is no
abstract extension common to sight and
touch; he proves the providence of God by
explaining the beauty and value of the language
of vision; and he exhibits the organism
of the universe by tracing the connection
between the virtues of tar-water and
the hidden mysteries of things. He always
seeks a concrete instance of the abstract fact,
and assails a particular case of the general
principle he wishes to attack. This method
is carried out in the 'Principles.' He does
not assail the doctrine of abstract ideas in
general, nor endeavour to strip Lockianism
of all its notionalism. He fastens on one
particular abstract idea, which because of its
importance and prevailing influence may be
considered as the champion of the rest, and
puts to flight the armies of the Philistines
by slaying their Goliath.</p>

<p>The sum and head of all abstract ideas is
the idea of matter, as this was used in the
new philosophy of the seventeenth century.
For what is an abstract idea? It is a connecting
link between sensations&mdash;something
to which they may be referred, in which
they are supposed to inhere, and which is
thought to account for their permanence of
objective reality. For example, 'white' is a
single quality or a single sensation felt by me
now and here when I look at a sheet of
paper. But 'whiteness' is the abstract idea
to which all these single sensations may be
referred, and in which they may inhere and
so have a permanence and objective reality,
so that this sheet of paper, because it has
'whiteness,' is always and by every one seen
to be 'white.' The abstract ideas of extension,
of situation, and of number, are examples
which are supposed to be of more importance,
and to include a vastly larger
number of individuals. Now the one idea
to which every sense-particular, without exception,
may be referred is the idea of matter
or material substance. It gives them permanence,
reality, and objectivity. It is the
germ, the centre, the vital spot of the whole
system of abstractions. Destroy it, and the
system perishes. Show that it is an illusion,
a mere word,&mdash;that it can give no reality, no
permanence,&mdash;that it cannot afford a basis
for scientific knowledge nor community of
belief, and the whole doctrine which seeks
to build science and reality on such a foundation
disappears, and on the ground thus
cleared a more substantial, real, and living
structure of belief and opinion may be
erected. This seems to be the guiding
thought in the 'Principles of Human Knowledge'
and in the 'Dialogues.' It is mainly
negative,&mdash;a denial of matter, and therefore
of all abstractions. But amidst the negative
or destructive reasonings there are traces, as
there must be, of positive construction. The
<i>one</i> positive principle which is always present
is that spiritual intuition which we have
already spoken of,&mdash;the all-pervading belief
inherited from the mystics, and particularly
from Malebranche and Norris, that mind or
spirit is the one reality and the one fount of
active agency. But this intuition, always
present, is never adequately expressed nor
applied. Berkeley either meant to reserve
its discussion for another 'Part,' or his natural
impatience made him overlook the necessity
of explaining the steps in his analysis
of all <i>reality</i> into personal spirit, and all
<i>causality</i> into the conscious activity of such
personal spirits. He is always confused,
hesitating, and sometimes conflicting in his
statements about the way in which 'mind'
becomes the only real existence, and the
'activity of mind' the only real agency; and
it is in the skill with which he has pierced
together the scattered hints into one really
complete and so far adequate explanation of
the universe of things that Professor Fraser's
unwearied patient study and just appreciation
of his author is seen to most advantage.</p>

<p>Our experience as given us in the senses
is made up 'of sensations, ideas, or phenomena,&mdash;facts
of which there is a perception
or consciousness.' These sensations, and
nothing else, make the material of the sensible
universe which we see and know and
live in,&mdash;they are the material out of which
the shifting scenes in this wonderful panorama
of sense-life are formed,&mdash;they are the
exciting causes of all the various forms of
our mental life, of our joy and sorrow,
laughter and tears, hopes and despairings.
When we are conscious of the outward world,
it is of a world of sensations which is <i>immediately</i>
present to our minds and in our
minds; for the essence of an idea or sensation
is that it is perceived,&mdash;its <i>esse</i> is <i>percipi</i>.
But this is not the whole of Berkeley's
theory of matter, as many critics would have
us believe. There is along with this 'immediate
perception of extended sensible reality'
a 'mediate perception or a presumptive inference
of the existence of sensible things
and their relations.' The knowledge we
have of the external world of the senses
cannot be reduced to the sensations of which
we are actually conscious for the time being.
There are, besides the sensations immediately
present, clustering groups of others which we
do not immediately perceive. Tangible
things are signified by visual sensations, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
sounds recall colours and shapes. Every
isolated sensation is significant of more than
itself, and <i>mere</i> sensation is impossible. And
this significance of sensations, the reality of
their <i>relations</i> to each other, recognised and
insisted upon by Berkeley, makes his scheme
different from any system of merely subjective
idealism, and supplies a basis for objective
or scientific knowledge. 'For,' as
Professor Fraser says, 'faith in an established
or external association between our sense-phenomena
is the basis of the constructive
activity of intellect in all inductive interpretation
of sensible things.' It is this 'external,'
or imposed association, which <i>universalizes</i>
and gives objective existence to sensations
and the sense-world, and so far Berkeley's
explanation does not differ very much
from that of Mr. Mill or Professor Bain.</p>

<p>But then, what is Berkeley's 'association'?
It is, as Professor Fraser well puts it, 'his
religious faith in the constancy of the Divine
constitution of the Cosmos.' The associative
relations of things which give permanence
and objective reality and intelligibility to the
world of sense-phenomena are not to be explained
by any hap-hazard one-coming-after-another,
as modern psychologists do. They
are due to the active agency of the Supreme
Mind which links sensations together in ways
of His own, so that there exists, not a chaos
of varying, changing phenomena, but an
orderly intelligible system of sense things,
co-existing and successive, significant of each
other, and all together making the interpretable
language of Him whose designs they
embody, and by whose constant activity they
are all maintained. 'And thus,' as Professor
Fraser has beautifully expressed it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>'The only conceivable and practical, and for us the only
possible, substantiality in the material world
is&mdash;permanence of co-existence or aggregation among
sensations; and the only conceivable and practical, and for
us the only possible, causality among phenomena
is&mdash;permanence or invariableness among their successions.</p>

<p>These two are almost (but not quite) one. The actual or
conscious co-existence of all the sensations which
constitute a particular tree, or a particular mountain,
cannot be simultaneously realized. A few co-existing visible
signs, for instance, lead us to expect that the many other
sensations of which the tree is the virtual co-constituent
would gradually be perceived by us, if the conditions for
our having actual sensations of all the other qualities were
fulfilled. The substantiality and causality of matter thus
resolve into a Universal Sense-symbolism, the interpretation
of which is the office of physical science. The material
world is a system of interpretable signs, dependent for its
actual existence in sense upon the sentient mind of the
interpreter; but significant of guaranteed pains and
pleasures, and the guaranteed means of avoiding and
attaining pains and pleasures: significant too of other
minds, and their thoughts, feelings, and volitions; and
significant above all of Supreme Mind, through whose
Activity the signs are sustained, and whose Archetypal Ideas
are the source of those universal or invariable relations of
theirs which make them both practically and scientifically
significant or objective. The permanence and efficiency
attributed to Matter is in God&mdash;in the constitutive
Universals of Supreme Mind: sensations or sense-given
phenomena themselves, and sensible things, so far as they
consist of sensations, can be neither permanent nor
efficient; they are in constant flux. This indeed is from
the beginning the tone of Berkeley himself&mdash;much deepened in
"Siris."'</p>
</div>

<p>In Berkeley's earlier philosophy, and even
in his later, this grand conception of an
orderly universe permeated and ever upheld
by mind, is by no means fully or consistently
worked out, as Professor Fraser himself acknowledges.
The starting-point itself is
somewhat confused. Berkeley starts with
sensations. But the universe is not a universe
of sensations, but of sensible things,
and although the formula <i>esse est percipi</i>
will at once explain the meaning of a sensation,
it will not, without some argument and
explanation, account for the meaning of a
sensible thing. Berkeley did not sufficiently
recognise the difference, and he leaped to a
conclusion which, however right, should have
been reasoned out. A whole is not the aggregate
number of its parts, it is the sum of
the parts <i>plus</i> their being placed together.
There is a difference between a house and a
heap of stones. Now Berkeley did not seem
to see this, at least in his earlier philosophy.
Tangible distance was to him a series of
<i>minima tangibilia</i>, a series of tactual points;
visible distance a series of <i>visible points</i>, and
that only. Whereas, distance is really the
sensible points <i>plus</i> their arrangement. The
sensible thing is really the complex of sensations
<i>plus</i> their unification. We are not
disposed to believe with Professor Ueberweg<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>
that this oversight amounted to a
begging of the whole question, we hold with
Professor Fraser that there is only a little
confusion in apprehending the problem
aright, and a rashness in leaping to a conclusion
which should rather have been elaborated
and proved. Berkeley thought, as Professor
Fraser says, that 'the consciousness of my
own permanence, amid the changes in my
senses, is the only archetype, in my experience,
of proper substance or permanence;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
and apart from this experience, permanence
or substance is an unintelligible word.' His
thought was not substantially distinct from
Dr. Ueberweg's own,&mdash;who says<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> 'that individual
intuitions gradually arise out of the
original <i>blur</i> of perception, when man first
begins to recognise himself an individual
essence in opposition to the external world,'
and who elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> makes the notion of self
the type of the essence of things. That
unique thing called 'self' or 'I' is the only
real permanent unity known, and is therefore
the type of all permanence and unity elsewhere.
The <i>esse</i> or the essence which gives
shape and endurance to fleeting formless
sensations is mind&mdash;my mind or the Supreme
Mind. It is the <i>percipi</i>, <i>being perceived</i>, or
coming under the formative influence of
mind, which gives to a series of sensations
that unity which we can call 'distance,' that
shape and unity to the cluster of sensations
which we call 'leaf' that orderly series arrangement
and permanence which we call
the system of things. The action of mind
upon sensations, forming and arranging
them, is not discussed by Berkeley. He
contents himself with his vague spiritual intuition,
and leaves his readers to work out
his meaning. It does seem clear to us, however,
both from his references to the archetypes
of ideas in the 'Principles of Human
Knowledge,' and more especially from his
interesting discussions on the native archetypes
of ideas in his letters to Johnson, that
he did not altogether overlook the distinction
between mere complexes of sensations and
sensible things; but that he was sensible of
this distinction, and wished to explain that
the complex of sensations was transformed
into an orderly stable sensible thing by the
unifying formative mind putting as it were
its stamp upon it.<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>It was undoubtedly a hindrance to the
completeness of Berkeley's thoughts that he
had no clear and distinct scheme of ethical
relations before his mind when he was investigating
the relations between mind and
phenomena. It is true that, as Professor
Fraser says, 'the moral presumption of
our individual free and proper agency is obscurely
involved in Berkeley's philosophy of
sense from the first.' But the ethical relations
of the individual human spirit were
nowhere clearly seen, and were not made its
leading and peculiar characteristic. It was
reserved for Kant to place the moral relations
of these individuals and their significance in
the world of things in due prominence, and
it has been easier for men such as Schleiermacher
and Herman Lotze, who have come
after Kant, and who have maintained a doctrine
of the spiritual relations which exist in
and give order, cohesion, and permanence to
the universe, not unlike Berkeley's, to develop
the doctrine of these relations so far
as the human spirit goes, and give more
thoroughness and completeness to the scheme.
We may conceive Berkeley carefully working
out the double relation of human to divine
spirit, and finding in the sensible universe
the veil which hangs between, not
merely the orderly and pregnant language
of the Creator Spirit to be interpreted and
made intelligible by the creature spirit, but
also the shadowy reflection of the working
of the Creator towards the creature, and of
the striving of the creature towards the Creator.
Each thing, class, order, genus, and race,
with all its relations to all the other parts of
the vast order of things, filling the place in
the organism in which the Creator placed it,
acting, influencing, and ruling, according to
its function and place in the arrangement of
the whole; just as the individual, or class,
or nation fulfils, or ought to fulfil, the ethical
duties which its hands find to do, so that
the universe, in all its spheres of animate and
inanimate life, of organic and inorganic
bodies, becomes in its mutual action and
reaction, as Schleiermacher says, a 'fainter
ethic.'</p>

<p>Berkeley approaches this in his greatest
metaphysical work, the 'Siris.' It is here
that the thought of organism or development
in things and in the universe, which
comes in occasionally in his earlier writings,
is more fully expressed and even elaborated.
The very name suggests it, the book is a
<i>chain</i> of philosophical reflections and inquiries.
Faithful to the method of his
younger days, Berkeley takes a concrete instance
of the concatenation of nature. He
discourses on the virtues of tar-water, and
thoughts on these lead up to the highest
mysteries of the universe. But when we divest
the thoughts of this particular form, we
have such a system of the universe as Bacon
working with Plotinus might have conceived.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
The centre source and light of all is the One
Supreme Spirit&mdash;the personal omnipresent
God in whom we and all things live and more
and have our being. The universe is his reflection,
it represents his thoughts, it is the
revelation of his mind and will, it is his language.
But the old puzzling word 'arbitrary'
has disappeared, and this language of
nature is seen to depend upon great laws and
to be capable of interpretation because so
dependent. The esse of sensation and of the
sense-world generally, is still <i>percipi</i>, but the
ambiguity lying in the word is carefully distinguished.
On the one hand all things are
dependent on the creative and upholding influence
of the Supreme Spirit. He it is that,
making all things after their <i>kinds</i>, sends
forth and sustains the archetypes of things.
On the other hand, the fleeting sense-world
is framed and shaped by the individual mind
into the universe of things, in accordance
with the divine ideas or archetypes which lie
hidden in it. There is a double meaning in
the phrase, <i>esse</i> is <i>percipi</i>. It means both
that these ideas are dependent for the possibility
of existence on the divine thoughts, or
archetypes whose sensible shadows they are,
and also that all sensible things are dependent
for their particular formation and position
on the formative powers of the human
mind, which works in each man by general
laws of human intelligence, in accordance
with and for the discovery of the divine
ideas lying immanent in things. And thus
human knowledge is a reproduction, or discovery
and representation of the thoughts
which the divine creative thinking has built
into things;<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> human science is a presaging
or reading of the letters and words of nature
which manifest its order and harmony, in
the faith and expectancy that this same
order and harmony now prevailing, because
it depends on the divine ideas of the Creator,
is fixed and enduring;<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> and the 'proper
name of this world is Spirit&mdash;free immortal
Spirit&mdash;Spirit in communication with Spirit&mdash;Spirit
in dependence on and in reconciliation,
through Christ, with the one absolute
Spirit&mdash;God.'<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p class="p2">There are two antagonistic theories which
profess to summarise history. Vico attempted,
in the last century, to prove that the
course of human events had, like the planets,
an orbit of their own, into which they returned
after a certain number of years. In
fact, according to this philosopher, the tendency
of history was to repeat itself, much
like a compound circulating decimal. But
the rapid development of physical science
has, of late years, thrown this theory very
much into the shade, by confronting it with
the more glittering notion of human perfectibility.
Mankind, instead of gyrating in an
ellipse, move along a line of infinite progression.
Scientific men fondly imagined that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
the march of intellect was destined to impel
society, through stages of uninterrupted progress,
to a fanciful millennium. Knowledge
was to be the spiritual means of redeeming
the nations. When mankind came to understand
their relations to the surrounding universe,
Astrea would again visit the earth, and
the golden age return. There were not
wanting many minor postulates which seemed
to support this splendid vision. All the
wars of Europeans found their root in dynastic
interests, and would vanish, when the
wishes of the million became the main-spring
of politics. The knell of standing armies
was rung by a citizen soldiery; and with
standing armies vanished all fear of territorial
aggrandisement. Economic inventions and
the wide ramifications of industrial interests
were fast binding mankind in a network of
harmony and peace. Under war waged for
the spell of these illusions, philosophers and
statesmen had looked back upon the past as
the wilderness of humanity, and, from the
heights of Pisgah, sighted the promised land.
Even Gioberti, priest though he was, did not
shrink from avowing in his primato, that if
the Jews looked forward to the Messiah as
yet to come, in the light of the golden age,
he was as staunch in that belief as the stoutest
Israelite among them. The rationalist
divines have vied with the poets of our own
age in announcing the approach of the dawn
of an era of universal peace and happiness.
In the midst of these delightful anticipations
a speck appears upon a sunny sky, no bigger
than a man's hand. But it suddenly swells
to gigantic dimensions and sheds disastrous
twilight over the fairest regions of the earth.
Without any rational pretext whatever, two
of the most enlightened nations of Europe
rush with murderous weapons at each other's
throats. They close with deadly gripe; inflict
upon each other mortal blows, until one
sinks through sheer exhaustion. The collapsed
state is then let blood. Heavy gyves
are placed upon it, from which there is little
chance of escape for many years to come,
and then only by combination with some
other power. Between two races who were,
a little time ago, beginning to forget their
old animosity in acts of amity and goodwill,
the flames of hate are anew enkindled with
a vehemence destined to last through all
time. Now these phenomena may, doubtless,
be explained by the usual philosophic
method of assigning very simple causes to
very complicated effects.</p>

<p>As to which power is humanly responsible
for these multiplied disasters, is discussed
at large in the pamphlets before
us.<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> The question is not simply historical,
but bears directly upon the reasonableness
of the terms of peace which have been imposed.
If Prussia is as blameless in the
transactions which led to the outbreak, as
Bismark would make out, it is obvious he
had some reason for his recent severity.
But this, we think, can in no way be sustained.
We do not share the bias of the
authors who have written on this subject.
It is our opinion, having heard, with the impartiality
of a <i>nisi prius</i> judge, all that can
be said upon the subject, that both parties
have been lamentably in the wrong; that
the diplomatic relations between France
and Prussia for the last six years have been
conducted upon principles more worthy of
thieves than honest politicians; that each
has been attempting to overreach the other;
that Napoleon began these subterranean intrigues
with a view to secure all the prizes
of war without fighting for them, and that
Bismark so manipulated events as to cause
the Emperor to fight after all, and left him
nothing but defeat for his pains. Each
knew that the mining operations in which
both were engaged, had gone so far, that
they must explode somewhere, and each endeavoured
to direct the train from his own
territory to that of his neighbour. It is
beyond question that Bismark, if he did not
plan the Hohenzollern intrigue with his eyes
open to all the consequences, knew of its existence
when his Government denied all
knowledge of it. It is also clear that Baron
Von Theile, in a conference with Benedetti,
repudiated, on the part of his Government,
the very suggestion, after Bismark and the
King had expressed their approval of the
candidature.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> From the declarations of the
French ambassador on this occasion, Bismark
must have known the irritating effect
the avowal of the scheme must produce on
the French Government. He also refused
to advise the King simply to withdraw his
consent from Leopold's acceptance of the
Spanish crown, when pressed to do so by
the British Government,<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> though that step
would have probably induced France to
give up the quarrel. When the Prince
withdrew his claims to the Spanish throne at
the instance of his father, Prussia sullenly
refused to renounce her sanction to those
claims, and thus bore a very conspicuous
part in drawing upon Europe the consequences
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
which followed. Then, there is a
great deal of mystery about the telegram
from Ems conveying the falsehood that the
King, in a crowded watering-place, turned
upon his heel when accosted by, and refused
to speak with, the French ambassador.
Now, it is expressly admitted by Bismark,
that he sent copies of that telegram to all
the German representatives abroad; and
either himself or his subordinates must have
caused its insertion in the official Berlin
gazette, by which the war excitement in both
countries was roused to fever height.<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> We
all know it was that telegram which impelled
the French Government to launch their
declaration of war. It is also upon record
that France, in the course of February,
made, through Lord Clarendon, two overtures
to Berlin for mutual disarmament,
offering to reduce her various contingents
to the extent of 90,000 men, which was, in
fact, one-eighth of her army; but that
Bismark, having churlishly refused to listen
to the first proposal, did so far entertain the
second as to forward it to the King, who,
under the counsels of his astute chancellor,
declined the proposition on the ground that
the military organization of Prussia was the
vital principle of her constitution, and that
she was least of all inclined to modify it, in
front of an aggressive Russia, and with the
probability of an alliance between Austria
and the South German States<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>&mdash;two pretexts,
the hollowness of which, recent events sufficiently
demonstrate. Now, though the conduct
of France is utterly indefensible in
provoking the conflict after the Hohenzollern
grievance had been substantively withdrawn,
we cannot acquit Prussia of irritating her
adversary, and of provoking, in a great degree,
the blow she seemed anxious to repel.
In point of fact, both parties had their
respective interests in the struggle; both
desired to fight; both, like two pugilists,
had been in training for the encounter
during the last five years, and both were determined
that so opportune an occasion
should not be lost for bringing it on.</p>

<p>The indulgence of military vanity, and
the desire to dominate Europe, are faults
which may be ascribed to France in a larger
degree than to Prussia. But Germany,
after having disarmed her antagonist, has
indulged these propensities with a mercenary
spirit, and with the manifest intention of
wiping France out of the list of the great
powers. The frankness with which this is
avowed is admirable in its simplicity. France
must be hindered from being dangerous in
the future. She must, therefore, be reduced
to such a position as to render her alike
both impotent and defenceless. She must
be degraded from her state in the family of
nations. She is, therefore, stripped of her
armaments: her artillery, her muskets, her
swords, her ammunition, her military stores,
in fact, nearly all her implements and panoply
of war, are carted off to Berlin. That
she may not be in an immediate position to
supply their place, she is loaded with a
pecuniary indemnity which must exhaust the
energies of another generation. The frontiers
of the country are thrown back to the
state in which they were in the middle of
the sixteenth century. The strong chain of
fortresses which France has erected or fortified
during the last three hundred years,
with two or three minor exceptions, have
been wrenched from her by her enemy.
Strasburg, Bitsche, Phalsburg, Thionville,
and Metz, protecting that flank of France
which is most exposed to attack, are now
only so many reservoirs, ready, at a moment's
notice, to open the rivers of invasion and
deluge the country. Metz, which is only
some 160 miles from Paris, is a naked rapier
laid across the defenceless throat of France.
With her greatest buckler of defence in the
hands of Prussia, anything like independent
action on the part of France is manifestly
impossible. While Metz is in the hands of
Prussia, she must remain as politically weak
as Piedmont, with Austria in the Quadrilateral.
With a bankrupt exchequer, with a
pillaged population, with a disorganized
government, with a defenceless frontier,
with a mutilated territory, with civil feud in
her capitals, with all her strongholds in the
hands of the enemy, with an imposition of
&pound;200,000,000 sterling as a war indemnity,
France is not likely to recover her physical
strength in our day; and when vigour returns
to her shattered frame, it will be only
to feel she has lost her place in the councils
of Europe.</p>

<p>There are, of course, many excellent
reasons assigned for this sort of beneficence,
which need only be stated to win common
assent. Metz and Alsace belonged to the
house of Hapsburg in the fourteenth century.
They ought, therefore, to belong to
the house of Hohenzollern in the nineteenth,&mdash;a
convincing argument, which no country
so consistently as Prussia could urge with
elaborate effect. If every nation which has
been disintegrated during the last two hundred
years, should get back its own to-morrow,
we all know how much Prussia
would be a gainer by the transfer. But the
inhabitants of Alsace speak a patois of German
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
and French, which contains something
of both, and is not either. They are, therefore,
clearly entitled to be governed from
Berlin. This principle is beautifully illustrated
by the Sclave-speaking population of
Silesia, the Polish community of Posen, and
the Danes of Schleswig. What more in
keeping with this piebald collection of people,
in the name of nationality, than the
French people at Metz? Then, were not
Alsace and Lorraine taken by force and guile
from Germany? and what more proper to retake
them by the same openhanded violence?
But it is forgotten that these
provinces were first wrenched from France
by Germany, so that to restore the original
balance, France will have to scramble for
them again. By this flux and reflux of
empire, at least, one principle is fully assured.
Nations are prevented from becoming stagnant.
The standing pool of industrial affairs
is defecated. War becomes, not an exceptional,
but the normal condition of the universe.
Civilization has the consolation of
knowing that it has no sooner got on its
legs, and is about to gather into its granaries
an exuberant harvest, than it is knocked
over again and its fruits are withered.</p>

<p>It is singular that German ideologists,
whose views are so sound upon abstract subjects,
should put forth such inconsistent
trash, to justify their newly-adopted policy of
territorial aggrandizement. There are, however,
a large number of sentimentalists in
the world, who have a strange hankering for
the past, whose sympathies it was necessary
to secure. The German archives have,
therefore, been ransacked for every tittle of
evidence to prove that Metz was a German
province in the fourteenth century; and,
therefore, if any Frenchmen are found there
in the nineteenth, they ought to be under
Prussian rule. But to do Bismark justice,
he has a great contempt for trashy dialectics
of this character. He takes his stand upon
the firmer ground of political expediency.
France has invaded Germany some twenty-seven
times, stimulated entirely by her lust
for the Rhine provinces. It is, therefore,
necessary to reduce her to such conditions
that she is not likely to offend again. In
the case of the German ideologists, we grant
the premise, but deny the inference. They
are doubtless sincere in their unreason. But
Bismark's premiss and conclusion are alike
vicious, and no one knows that better than
himself.</p>

<p>The earlier wars of France against the
Empire arose out of the struggle for these
border possessions when the posterity of
Lothaire II., to whom they belonged, had
died out; but in these wars, France, then
being parcelled out among numerous vassals,
had the worst of it. A series of German
irruptions, under Henry the Fowler, and the
Othos, united these domains to the Empire.
They were, however, held more or less as
fiefs of the crown of France. The French
element within, and French intrigue without,
always gave the German emperors great uneasiness;
and this, combined with further
schemes of obtaining fresh fiefs in Burgundy
and Flanders, exposed France to two German
invasions&mdash;one under Henry V., and the
other under Otho IV., which made Louis the
Fat and Philip Augustus tremble for their
suzerainty. But the Germans soon found
in Italy a richer field for their exploits, and
France was left to constitute her unity without
much hindrance, until the empire fell
into Spanish hands. Afraid, then, of being
bodily eaten up, her monarchs became aggressive;
but their blows were aimed, not
against Germany, but against Spain, unluckily
without any great effect; for, the
towns of France were some half dozen times
invaded by the Emperor and his allies, her
king captured, and her fortresses demolished.
Our share in these plundering transactions
helped us to Tournay and Boulogne. In
the next series of wars, which arose out of
the religious and political dissensions of the
empire, if France intermeddled, she was invited
to do so by the Protestant princes of
Germany, with whom she was allied, and whose
interests were menaced by the house of
Austria. As the price of her intervention,
she got a portion of the disputed frontier;
but we never heard that Germany otherwise
than freely conceded the long-coveted prize
to her, or regarded this portion of the Treaty
of Munster as a menace to her liberties. It
was not until Louis Quatorze seized Franche
Comt&eacute;, and sent his legions over the
Rhine, that Germany manifested any uneasiness
at the ambition of France&mdash;an uneasiness
which the league of Augsburg immediately
dispelled, and an ambition which the
armies of Eugene and Marlborough levelled
to the ground. Hence, Lorraine soon afterwards
fell as quietly into the hands of
France, as if its exchange for the reversion
of Tuscany had been an arrangement of
Providence. We are rather curious, therefore,
to know how Count Bismark gets his
twenty-seven instances of French aggression
against Germany, and whether he includes
in the list the troops which France lent to
Prussia to enable her to retain her hold upon
Silesia, and the counter-support she gave
Maria Theresa to enable the empress to
defeat Prussia. It is evident no parties
are responsible for such interventions except
those who invite them; and to ascribe to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
the ambition of the people of France, wars
which arose out of the rapacity of his own
countrymen, is a phase given to the quarrel
which outrages common sense. Even were
all the wars carried on under the Louises,
the Richelieus, and the feudal princes of
France, as wantonly aggressive as Bismark
would make out, the French people are no
more responsible for them, than the horses
which dragged their artillery to the field.
They were waged frequently in their own
despite, purely for dynastic interests, and as
often undertaken to repel aggression, as to
make it. Even when the people woke up
to their sovereign rights, in 1789, from
whom did the first deliberate act of aggression
come? From mild and peace-loving
Prussia. Scarcely five years ago, we saw
both the Saxon and Bavarian palatinate entirely
at the mercy of the first French regiment
that might have ventured to cross the
border, without a hand being stretched forth
to snatch the defenceless prize. It is therefore
false, in fact, to assign to the French
such an incurable lust after German territory,
as to warrant the necessity of her political
servitude. The French have no specific
hatred to the Germans as a people, any more
than they have to the Italians, whose territory
they have honoured no less frequently
with their presence. The allegation of Bismark
is not, therefore, very assuring. He
revives the memory of these miserable feuds,
as a reason why they should be stopped;
and produces a treaty, for that purpose,
which only transmits them to posterity,
wrapped in a blaze of undying vehemence.
It is monstrous for the conquerors of a
country to assign, as a pretext for its abasement,
the participation of its rulers in those
quarrels which originated with themselves.
The great shield of Germany against French
interference is its unity. Had she further
insisted upon the fortresses in Alsace and
Lorraine being dismantled, with an adequate
pecuniary indemnity, she would then have
been doubly secure. But when, in addition,
she requires the keys of France to be placed
in her hands, and the country, bound hand
and foot, to be cast under her feet, it is idle
to say that Prussia is aiming at mere immunity
from aggression. There is a weightier
reason behind for the mutilation of France,
which it would be inconvenient to avow,
and that is the preservation, if not the increase,
of her own military ascendancy.</p>

<p>Prussia in making peace consulted her own
interests. Had her troops returned to Berlin
after concluding with France a wise and durable
treaty, that would have occurred which occurred
after the peace of 1815&mdash;Germany
would have demanded free and liberal institutions.
There would have been no necessity for
Prussian C&aelig;sarism. Berlin would have had
to modify her military constitution. There
would have been no necessity for vast armaments.
The world would have once more
settled down to pacific ways. But in leaving
behind her an exasperated France,
Prussia has the strongest of all motives for
inducing Germany to perpetuate her military
dictatorship, and keep the war ferment at
high pressure. But it is impossible that the
most pacific country can remain long under
the influence of such a military organization
as Prussia commands, without using it as an
instrument for further aggrandizement.
Were it indeed otherwise, a marvel would
occur, the like of which would be unknown
in history. Who ever heard of a power
suddenly overtopping Europe, and, amid a
handful of weaker states, stopping short in
her career of aggression? Those who believe
in the pacific virtues of Bismark, and
the pious sincerity of William, ask us to
indulge in anticipations which have never
been realised. Did Rome stop when it
overran the Peninsula, Macedon when it
fulminated over Greece, the Caliphs when
they stormed Constantinople, or the Hapsburgs
when they conquered Vienna? There
is a momentum in all states, once entered
upon a career of conquest, which hurries
them along with a speed proportionate to
the extent of their acquisitions. The law
of rising kingdoms may be formulated
almost with the same nicety as that of
falling bodies. Nor are there any circumstances
in this instance calculated to modify
its tendency, except such as give it vastly
preponderating force and direction.</p>

<p>It must not be overlooked in this case,
that the states under the hegemony of Prussia
are amongst the poorest in Europe. Some
three hundred thousand annually are driven,
by fell necessity, to seek that provision in
foreign lands which is denied them at home.
The little wealth possessed by the home
population is not in the possession of their
princes and feudal aristocracy, but in the
hands of the mercantile class, to whom war
would not be in the least distasteful, if it
opened out new avenues for their trade.
The poverty of the German Junker, however,
has been up to the present only
equalled by his pretentiousness. Sheridan
advised the last generation of them, to sell
their high-sounding titles, to buy worsted to
mend their stockings. Yet some of our
statesmen would have us believe that these
gentlemen, long suffering under a painful
sense of impecuniosity, will, on waking up
to the reality of their being masters of the
world, continue to go about, as heretofore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
with empty pockets. Can we suppose that
a strong state, steeped up to the ears in
poverty, will continue quiescent, surrounded
by weak states who oppose no barriers to
her possession of superabundant wealth?
The inference is against everything we know
of human nature, even upon the supposition
that Prussia, to whom the people have entrusted
their fortunes, is the most pacific
state in the world, and that they have been
attempted to be worried like bleating lambs,
in the recent struggle. The only rational
conclusion is that the Junkers of Germany
will, like every other impoverished class,
make the most of their new position. They
will sit down to consider what countries
contain the great reservoirs of commerce,
and by what accession of territory the stream
of wealth may be diverted to their own land.
Germany is in the condition of the miller
who had large mills but no water. Is it
likely, when she has the power, she will refrain
from entering her neighbour's territory,
to divert the course of the element which
sweeps by her with such majestic abundance,
without rendering any service to herself?
If she did not withhold her hand from a few
barren roods in the case of Denmark, is she
likely to do so when the prize is more
tempting, the power to snatch it a thousand
degrees more startling, and the chances of
failure so much less? There can be only
one reply to these questions. If the <i>bourgeoisie</i>
condemned the movement, their
opposition would be treated with the same
indifference as the opposition of the great
commercial class to the war of 1866. But
the Minister has only to show the trading
class that the movement is a commercial
venture, and he will convert them into his
staunchest adherents.</p>

<p>The German people have acquired of late
years a peace-loving character, which, however,
is rather adventitious than real, springing
more out of the helplessness into which
they were thrown by the dissensions of the
Diet, than out of any innate disposition to be
less quarrelsome than their neighbours.
That they are more phlegmatic, more industrious,
and less easily roused than the French
may be readily admitted. But we should be
strangely oblivious of the thirty years' war,
of the Silesian wars, of the Swedish and Italian
wars, of the Danish and Austrian wars,
if we came to the conclusion that, if left to
themselves, and in possession of their united
strength, they would be the most benignant
people in the world. The Germans have always
evinced a conservative disposition to
follow their feudal chiefs, and, by espousing
their quarrels, have kept Europe embroiled
for many centuries. In no other country
could a small state like Prussia spring out of
a mere society of Knight Templars, and in
less than two hundred years, take her place
among the first powers of the globe. While
the smaller states of the empire followed
their indolent habits, and cultivated the <i>dilettante</i>
tastes of their rulers, Prussia was
perpetually sharpening her sword, carving
out of her neighbours fresh slices of territory,
and using one acquisition as a stepping-stone
to another. The acceptance of the peaceful
pursuits to which the inaction of the minor
states, and the jealous rivalries and despotic
tendencies of the larger, impelled their respective
populations, as a pledge of the new
era of quiet harmony upon which Europe is
about to enter, is only another instance of
taking the forced and exceptional state of a
people for its normal and natural condition.
If the German people could be divorced from
their feudal leanings, if they could bind up
their unity with free institutions, and sink
the interest of each particular state in that of
the entire community, we should regard
their assumption of military supremacy as a
blessing to Europe. But this state of things,
so near being accomplished in 1848, is now
further off than ever. Prussia, then, by the
free voice of Germany, was offered the Imperial
crown, upon condition of merging her
individual sovereignty in that of the commonwealth.
But she refused. Now she has got
it upon her own terms&mdash;that of merging the
commonwealth into herself. All the power
and might of Germany, instead of being
allied with liberal institutions, is wielded by
one despotic hand. Instead of Germany
swallowing up Prussia, Prussia has swallowed
up Germany. Germany in inaugurating her
unity, like the young man coming to his
heritage, was surrounded by two candidates
for her favours,&mdash;free institutions and military
despotism&mdash;and, succumbing to the
tempter, she has flung herself into the embraces
of military despotism.</p>

<p>Prussia, who first intoxicated Germany
with the idea of unity, has debauched her
with the doctrine of nationality. The lure
was in the Elbe Duchies, which she first held
out to the Fatherland, and then appropriated
to herself. The overthrow of Austria induced
the Northern states to submit, some
out of compulsion, and others out of love,
but all out of a hope that under so puissant
a leader, an impoverished state of independence
might be changed for one of wealthy
servility. Hence, the Confederation or
Staatenbund of the North, which placed the
armaments and international relationships of
all the states on the Prussian side of the
Main completely under the control of Berlin.
The Treaty of Prague guaranteed independent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
action, as well as a separate confederation
to the German states south of the
Main. But while the ink wherewith that
treaty was signed was scarcely dry, and while
Napoleon was congratulating his subjects on
having set up two confederations in Germany
instead of one, Bismark signed treaties
of offensive and defensive alliance with
each of the Southern States, which made
their confederation an impossibility, by placing
all their armaments as completely in the
hands of Prussia as if they belonged to the
Northern Bund. But, in these days, changes
take place so rapidly as to exhaust our
breath in recounting them. The goal of
Prussian ambition to-day, is its starting-post
to-morrow. The North German Confederation,
with their treaties of defensive and offensive
alliance, which have done their work
so effectually in the subjugation of France,
has already made room for another edifice of
a more momentous character. The Staatenbund,
which has disappeared, was, as its
name imports, a mere confederacy. The
union was effective for federal purposes, but
too much individual action was left to the
component bodies. The armies of the Confederacy,
though under the command of the
King of Prussia, as President of the Bund,
owed fealty to their respective chiefs. There
is something na&iuml;ve in the declaration that
they should have command of their own
troops in time of peace. But now this
poor shadow of sovereignty is taken away,
and the armies of the Northern States, both
in peace and war, are handed over to the
King of Prussia, and constitute part and
parcel of the Prussian force. The joints
have, therefore, been tightened in proportion
as the area has been extended. In point of
fact, the former mediatized states have been
virtually incorporated with Prussia; while the
semi-independent sovereignties of the south
have been reduced to the position of the
former mediatized states. They have only
one railway and water communication, one
system of post and telegraph, one mercantile
marine, one tariff, one code of civil and
criminal judicature, one consulate, and one
army and navy. The states south of the
Main now find themselves bound up in closer
ligatures with those of the north than formerly
united these with each other. In other
words, the Staatenbund has been changed into
a Bundesstaat, or a confederacy into one
allied State. The whole of Germany, from
the Baltic to the Vosges, from the frontiers
of Gallicia to the mouth of the Weser, is
now united in a single commonwealth, with
an hereditary emperor, with a central parliament,
and a common capital: we need hardly
add that the majority of that parliament are
Prussian subjects, that the Emperor is the
Prussian monarch, and that the capital is
Berlin.</p>

<p>It is curious to notice the careful guarantees
by which Prussia has secured the increase
of her ascendancy in the new institution,
and the growth of centralization in her
hands. No change can be effected in the
charter which is opposed by fourteen votes
of the Federal Council. But as she has
seventeen of these, it is clear Germany cannot
enter upon a more liberal regime unless
Prussia wishes it. Baden and Hesse have,
like the Northern States, handed over their
armies to Prussia, with whose forces they are
henceforth incorporated. The King of Bavaria
has the command of his own troops
only in times of peace; in war he is liable to
be superseded by a Federal commander,
appointed by the Emperor. W&uuml;rtemburg has
consented to consign her troops to a Federal
commander, nominated by Prussia, both in
peace and war. For this concession the
King has been allowed to appoint his inferior
officers, subject to the approval of the
Emperor. Throughout the rest of Germany,
the appointment of all the officers rests entirely
with the Emperor. All the citadels
and fortresses of every state, without exception,
are surrendered into his hands. He
can give the keys of all the strong places to
whom he chooses. The Emperor alone can
make war or conclude peace; though unless
the country be invaded, he has been restricted,
at the instance of Bavaria, from making
war without the consent of the Federal Council.
But, as King of Prussia, he can make
war when he pleases, which renders him
as practically independent of control as if
the restriction did not exist. The armaments
of Germany are, therefore, as practically in
the hands of Prussia, as the armaments of
Russia are in those of the Czar. The concessions
in favour of the Kings of W&uuml;rtemburg
and Bavaria are so trifling, that to call
these princelings kings any longer is trifling
with the name. Their sovereignties are virtually
absorbed in the crown of Prussia.
Let the phantom monarchs, who have signed
their own death-warrants at Munich and
Stuttgart, presume to interfere with the mandates
of Berlin, and they will be dealt with
as summarily as any provincial <i>maire</i> who
ventured to disobey imperial decrees under
the Napoleonic <i>r&eacute;gime</i>.</p>

<p>These results we ventured to predict some
five years ago, but they have been brought
about with a celerity and completeness which
even have surprised ourselves.<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> The fact is,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
there is a splendour and glitter about military
achievements which the soberest cannot
withstand, when they appear in the shape of
victories over those who have been perpetually
disparaging our strength or crowing
over our weakness. It would, indeed, have
been a great advantage to German liberty,
had the different states been allowed to consolidate
their unity in peace. Prussia would
then have been obliged to make terms with
the southern populations, who would have
been alive to the necessity of obtaining solid
pledges from her, that the resources of the
German commonwealth should not be squandered
to gratify the ambition of the house
of Hohenzollern. But the astonishing exploits
of Prussia, the unparalleled series of
triumphs which have laid France prostrate at
her feet, have carried away the judgments of
the populations of the South, and induced
them to call for indiscriminate amalgamation
with the conqueror, in terms which their
princes could not withstand. The sovereigns
of Stuttgart and Munich had, therefore, no
choice between deposition and obedience to
the popular voice. They therefore made a
virtue of necessity, and were the first to offer
the Imperial Crown to the King of Prussia.
In the Salle des Glaces at Versailles,
surrounded by the pictures and medallions
which perpetuate the triumphs of Louis XIV.
in Franche Comt&eacute; and the Netherlands, and
beneath the roof of the edifice dedicated to
all the glories of France, King William was
solemnly proclaimed Emperor, on the anniversary
of the day when, 170 years ago, the
Elector Frederick first assumed the crown of
Prussia. Before all the representatives of
Germany, ranged beneath the banners of
their respective states, at the gates of the
French capital, already quivering in the
throes of capitulation, and girt round with all
the panoply and pride of victorious armies,
the German cannon thundered out the ominous
title in the ears of dying France. In
the power which the title created, the lofty
pinnacle to which it elevated the sovereign
upon whom it was conferred, in the proud
circumstances under which the transfer of
the Imperial Crown was accomplished, the
imagination is carried back to the days of
Charlemagne and Frederick Barbarossa in
order to find a parallel. For, the pageant
represented the assumption of no mere primatial
dignity, but the extension of direct
sovereign power, absorbing some three kingdoms,
with twenty-four principalities, which
at once enables it to become supreme in Europe,
both in war and peace. The nominal
federal ties, by which the princes of the
Southern States are allowed to flatter their
hereditary vanity, cannot even outlast the
present generation; for the new elections to
the Federal Parliament have returned a large
majority, to strengthen the autocratic interests
and centralizing policy of Prussia.
The need of simplification in the laws which
bind up the different states into one homogeneous
body, will powerfully contribute to
the same end, so that, in a few years, Prussia
will find herself wielding the power of the
C&aelig;sars, with a single national authority.</p>

<p>That Prussia will not use the tremendous
force she has thus acquired to fight for
empty name or mere <i>gloire</i>, or marshal her
battalions for deadly conflict, simply because
some foreign ambassador has refused to take
off his hat to one of her kings' mistresses,
may be readily conceded; and, taking the
transfer of military ascendancy from Paris
to Berlin, so much in the interests of peace
has doubtless been gained. But what guarantee
have we that Prussia will not use her
vast accession of power to augment her
material interests and enrich the populations
who have confided their fortunes to her
management? The military and naval supplies
are raised by taxes, over which neither
parliament&mdash;the Reichstag, nor the Federal
Council&mdash;the Bundesrath, has the slightest
control. The chief corner-stone of English
liberty is the dependence of the executive
on Parliament. If it cannot get the supplies
from the legislature, down it goes.
But in the adroit charter lately manipulated
at Versailles, there is no executive beyond
the Prussian monarch and his chancellor,
and the military taxes of the Empire find
their way into their exchequer, without any
check or hindrance, quite as if the process
was a law of nature. The great doctrine of
ministerial responsibility, without which not
even the shadow of constitutional liberty
can be inaugurated, finds no place in the
charter of the new federal Empire. It is
true that any extraordinary levies or augmentation
of the armaments of the Empire
would have to receive the sanction of the
new German legislature. But when we
remember that the military resources of the
Empire are already developed to the utmost,
that the normal military organization of
the Empire enables Bismark to exhaust its
last thaler, employ its last musket, and call
out its last man, it would appear a mockery
to hold out this provision as a guarantee of
the influence of the popular element in the
new constitution. It does not improve the
situation, when we remember, how resolutely
the popular element in the Prussian
Chambers was set at defiance by the King
and his Minister, upon the refusal of the
majority to endorse the increased armaments
which they demanded, to enable them to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
appropriate the Duchies, and afterwards to
fight Austria. Bismark suspended the
Prussian Constitution for four years, to
carry out his policy of blood and iron. A
despotic charter, in the hands of Liberal ministers,
might be modified in favour of progress.
But with a despotic charter in the hands of
a despotic minister, we see little hope for
the future pacification of Europe. France
is under the heel of Germany, and Germany
under the heel of Prussia. That that power
will henceforth champion the liberties she
has hitherto done her best to repress; that
she will voluntarily renounce the plundering
policy which has been the predominant
feature of her character for a policy of justice
and rectitude; that she will hereafter woo
peace with the same ardour with which she
has up to the present wooed the sword, is
what we most devoutly wish, but which we
cannot bring ourselves to believe.</p>

<p>In fact, Prussia has by no means fulfilled
the destiny which she avows it is her honest
mission to accomplish. She is called by
Providence to unite the whole of Fatherland
under her sceptre. But the German kingdom
still remains divided. The edifice of
German nationality still requires the copestone
for the completion of the structure.
The words which her sovereign addressed
to the German people on the day when he accepted
the imperial crown at Versailles, are
strikingly significant of her pretensions, 'The
Empire,' said the king, or rather Bismark,
who spoke in his person, 'has been in abeyance
some sixty years. We are summoned
to undertake its re-establishment.' In 1806,
the dissolution of the old Germanic Empire
followed as a natural consequence of the
Confederation of the Rhine. The Emperor
of Austria, at the dictation of Napoleon,
then renounced the title and regalia of the
empire which had fallen to pieces, but
which King William now takes it upon himself
to revive. 'Accordingly,' says this
monarch, 'we and our successors to the
crown of Prussia henceforth shall use the imperial
title in all the relations and affairs of the
German Empire; and we hope to God that
it may be vouchsafed to the German people
to lead the Fatherland on to a blessed future
under the auspices of its ancient splendour.'<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>
As an earnest of this intention, Alsace and
German-speaking Lorraine, together with
a portion of French-speaking Lorraine,
brought under the German flag, is an important
revival of the old kingdom on its western
frontier. This is a rich slice to commence
with. But the resuscitation of the
Empire with the western limb of the Austrian
monarchy, and nine millions of Germans
left out, is like the resuscitation of
Greece without either Athens or Thermopyl&aelig;;
or the play of Hamlet, with the
part of the Prince excluded from the programme.
The union of Fatherland would
be a mockery, and the revival of the Empire
a nullity, without the annexation of those
provinces which constitute the birthplace
and cradle of its history. Accordingly,
when the Germanic Confederation was set
up in 1815, as a substitute for the old diet,
the German provinces of Austria were
deemed of such importance as to confer
upon her the leading voice in its councils.
It is not, therefore, likely that some forty-two
millions of Germans will long remain
united, without endeavouring to include,
under the same hegemony, the nine additional
millions now clamouring for admission
outside. Already, within the German provinces
of Austria, committees are established,
with a view to afford their Northern brethren
a fulcrum for realizing the desired event.
In Glatz, Salzburg, Innspr&uuml;ck, Linz, and
Vienna, <i>f&ecirc;tes</i> were prepared to celebrate the
recent triumphs of their German compatriots,
which the Hohenhart ministry was obliged
to suppress by force. But even despite of
the Government, numerous meetings have
been held in which the warmest eagerness
for German unity and for federal union with
Berlin has been expressed. Indeed, the
Austro-Germans who formerly aspired to
lead Fatherland, now live in subordination
to the Sclaves, whose influence in the Austrian
Chambers, by mere force of numbers,
is paramount to their own. They, therefore,
seek union with their heroic countrymen,
with all the more ardour, as it would
release them from the ascendency of a race
whom they despise. Guided by the aspirations
of his countrymen, Bismark will find a
much easier passage across the Inn to the
Leitha than across the Rhine to the Moselle.
The work of German nationality has advanced
so far that we must doubt, if Prussia
remained indifferent to the prize, that the
fusion would not be accomplished by the
very momentum which the movement has
already acquired. But with Prussia, true to
the grasping instincts of her house, clothed
with the enormous prestige of her recent victories,
and throwing all her energies into the
struggle, Austria can no more resist the absorption
than a wave of the Eider could resist
being swallowed up in a ground swell from
the German Ocean.</p>

<p>The limits of the revived Empire on its
Southern frontier will, doubtless, be such as
to enclose those provinces in which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
Germans form the principal element. These
comprise Upper and Lower Austria, including
Salzburg, Styria, Carinthia, and the
Tyrol. Some two millions occupy the north
and western frontiers of Bohemia. In the
north-east of Moravia, and the eastern part
of Austrian-Silesia, there are some seven
hundred thousand more. But the proportion
of the German to the Sclavonic
populations of Bohemia and Moravia
is only one-fourth; so that these provinces
cannot be annexed to the German Empire
without giving the doctrine of nationality its
<i>coup de gr&acirc;ce</i>. But Moravia and Bohemia
constituted integral portions of the old German
Empire. They were, also, reclaimed
as such by Austria, on the construction of
the Germanic Confederation in 1815. There
are besides strategical reasons. For the Austrian
Archducal province, with its three
millions of Germans, would be blocked up
between the Czechs and Magyars, while
Bohemia would extend like a wedge into
the bowels of the Empire. We are afraid,
that when the question comes to be settled,
both Bohemia and Moravia will find themselves
eaten up, sandwichlike, by the German
populations on the north and south
frontiers, and assimilated into the political
body which is already dominating Europe.</p>

<p>But the necessity of increased outlets for
German industry, and of further materials
for the expansion of her commerce, will be
as powerful a stimulant for the growth of
Prussian C&aelig;sarism as the principle of nationality.
Germany having achieved her
national unity, will require free access to the
seaboard of the German Ocean. She will
require ships and colonies. The possession of
Holland would place all these requirements at
her disposal, and enable her to fructify her
home commerce a hundredfold. Professor
Newman sees such advantage to both parties
in the annexation, that he is anxious the
union should be accomplished; he rather
na&iuml;vely adds that Prussia will withhold her
hand, because she would not wish to be
hampered with Java or Surinam, and the
other possessions which alone impart to
Holland its significancy. Twenty millions
of colonial population, however, would be
a prize as glittering to the Germans as the
Dutch seaboard at home; and, therefore,
no one was overwhelmed with surprise when
its annexation was mentioned as one of the
overtures made by Bismark to the French
Emperor in return for Prussian acquiescence
in the French seizure of Belgium. Nor can
it excite wonder that the French Emperor
refused as promptly as his uncle, when the
Russian Alexander offered to France both
Syria and Egypt in return for allowing him
to seize Constantinople. But now there is no
France to block the way, and Holland is
entirely at the mercy of Berlin. The House
of Nassau had its representative in the Germanic
Confederation, to answer for the
interests of Luxembourg. Why should it
not have its representative in the Bundesrath
at Berlin, and sacrifice its independence, to
bask in the splendour of the new Empire?
If the four millions of Dutchmen do not fall
in with these suggestions so readily as the
five millions of Bavarians, they will be found
as incompetent as the Bavarians would have
been, to oppose the high behests and the
colossal interests of a race of fifty millions,
who threaten to rule the world. The Netherlands
were an important limb of the old
Germanic Empire. The Dutch section of it
is identified with Germany by military
traditions. Her language and religion are
Teutonic. In resuming possession of this
territory, the revivers of the old imperial
domination would not meet with anything
like the difficulties they have to encounter in
incorporating the eastern frontiers of France.</p>

<p>The absorption of Holland, by so powerful
a country as Germany, would deal a
heavy blow at our own naval supremacy.
But this danger is the least of those which
are ahead. For Prussia does not appear
alone upon the scene of action; and there
are prizes for her to seize, which require the
support of an ally who has herself a direct
interest in the spoil, and who is troubled
with as few scruples as Prussia herself.
There cannot, we think, be a doubt that
Prussia entered upon the recent campaign
with a secret understanding with Russia, of
armed intervention on the part of that power,
in case of certain eventualities arising out of
the war, unfavourable to Prussia. The two
combatants had not measured swords at Spicheren,
before this treaty was suddenly announced,
and as boldly denied. The cordial
greetings of the two courts, moreover, during
the progress of the war; the shout of
rapture which every French disaster drew
from the Emperor Alexander; the indiscreet
announcement of the Emperor William, that
he would never forget that he owed it to the
attitude of his Imperial nephew that the war
did not assume larger dimensions, and the
conferring on each other, at the conclusion
of the campaign, military honours; all these
things tend conclusively to prove that, in
league with Prussia, there is a power still
more formidable to the liberties of mankind.
Had it not been for this assurance of support
from Russia, it would have been perfect
madness for Prussia to leave her eastern
frontier exposed to the inroads of Austria,
when that power was counting her chances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
as to throwing in her lot with France. Had
Austria moved a musket, Russia would have
poured her troops through the defiles of the
Carpathians, and given her another enemy
to encounter. Bismark was, therefore, enabled
to leave Saxony as much unprotected,
as were the Rhine Provinces in the war of
1866. When France was prostrate; when
she was expiring under the terrible effects of
the blow which she had recklessly invited,
but which the connivance of Russia enabled
Germany with collective force to deal; that
power plainly exposed her cards, and showed
the interests she had in the struggle. In the
month of November, Gortschakoff startled
London by announcing the intention of Russia
to repudiate the treaty of 1856. Within a
little time afterwards, the Prussian Prince of
Roumania declared he could no longer support
his position as Turkish feudatary; but
must convert his government into one of independent
sovereignty, or retire from it altogether.
About the same period, as if to
bring the repudiation of treaties in fashion,
Bismark announced the resolution of Prussia
to withdraw from the guarantee of 1867
protecting the neutrality of Luxembourg.
If two of these difficulties have been transitionally
arranged, the compromisers have
only deferred the real solution of the question
they involve, to a more convenient opportunity.
It is very ominous for England,
that Europe, at present, is virtually in the
hands of two potentates evidently acting in
concert with each other, who can place two
millions and a half of fighting men in the
field; and that both have shown a disposition
to complicate affairs in the East, to the
spoils of which each possesses peculiar pretensions,
as well as peculiar means of realizing
those pretensions in the amplest manner.</p>

<p>The interest of Russia in driving the
Turks out of Europe is traditional. She
believes in it as a mission to which she is
called by divine Providence. It is not
merely an affair of conquest, but a matter of
religion. For this she exists as a nation,
bound to execute the task at all hazards, and
to intermit no opportunity of bringing it
about. With Prussia it is merely a question
of arithmetic. But the gain to her, were
the struggle only partially decided in her
favour, is such as to overpower even an
Oriental imagination. The conjoint export
and import trade of Turkey may be set
down at forty millions annually. Of this
trade England has, at present, the lion's
share. The rest is mainly divided between
Italy, France, Austria, and Russia. Prussia
and Northern Germany enjoy little or next
to nothing of it. Turkey, to them, might as
well not be in existence, except for the
wealth it pours into the coffers of their
neighbours. Formerly Russia has been
prevented from dealing with the 'sick
man' by the protectorate of the Western
Powers. England and France have been
repeatedly offered ascendancy on the banks
of the Nile, in return for permitting Russian
ascendancy on the shores of the Bosphorus.
But, besides the principle of equity, which
no English minister dare contravene, it would
have been an absurd policy, in exchange for
an African or Asiatic province, to place our
trade in the Levant in jeopardy, by allowing
Russia to instal herself in Constantinople.
But Russia has now an accomplice who can
help her to the booty, who is troubled with no
moral delicacy, and who would gain a large
revenue out of the transaction. Prussia, by
laying her hand upon the north-western limb
of European Turkey, would command the
navigation of the Danube, and divert a large
stream of Oriental commerce to the capitals
of Germany. Provinces which are at present
rich, even in their uncultivated state, would,
colonized by Prussia, become the granaries
of the world. The Italian portions of the
Empire are gone from it irretrievably: but
Germany can indemnify herself by expansion
in an eastern direction. If, therefore, no
extraneous force intervenes, we look forward
to the establishment of a Prussian sovereignty,
extending from the Euxine to the Adriatic,
and owning no limit till it tops the
crests of the Balkan. The scion of her
house, who has already converted the Principalities
into a Prussian arsenal, is in an admirable
position to direct her energies towards
this object. While Russia operates on the
Asiatic frontier, the Prussian Hospodar,
backed by German battalions, and reinforced
with ordnance from Berlin, has only to put
out his hand, and Bosnia and Servia are in
his grasp. With the iron and steel of the
Vosges, with the copper, lead, and silver
mines of Carinthia and Carniola, with the
silks and carpets of Shumla, and the grain of
Servia and Roumania, Germany would possess
a trade with which the commerce of Italy in
the Middle Ages, or the colossal industries
of England in the nineteenth century, would
be dwarfed in comparison. Would she resist
the prize within her reach, if the tempter
at her ear instigated her to take it as her
share of the spoil? The Ottoman Empire
may be said to derive the very breath of
its existence from the jealousy of the great
Powers. The States of the West had an instinctive
dread of the great Empire of the
North, besides a mutual mistrust of each
other; and, therefore, the fairest plains of
Europe were allowed to remain in possession
of those who had no ambitious instincts to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
gratify, and no foreign predilections to indulge.
But now the state of affairs is profoundly
changed, and Turkey finds herself
at the mercy of two military despots, who
are acting in concert, without any protection
from their cupidity, but what their own mistrust
of each other may happen to oppose.</p>

<p>Up to 1866 five great Powers existed in
Europe. But we cannot conceal it from
ourselves, that in the interim of a few years,
three of these have either been neutralized
or practically effaced. Since the battle of
K&oelig;niggratz it would be idle to say that
Austria is of any account in Europe. The
blow she received at Solferino was a prelude
to the loss of Venetia, and the loss of her
Italian possessions is only a prelude to the
stroke which will drive her completely out
of Germany. When empires rise, they accomplish
the task of expansion with difficulty
and labour, but when they sink, everything
appears greased to impel the wheels along
the declivity of descent. Austria has ceased
to be an empire, and will soon find it difficult
to maintain an independent sovereignty.
When her Germans imitate her quondam
Italian subjects in attaching themselves to
their own nationality, the Magyar and multifarious
Sclavonian tribes will alone remain,
whose respective interests are so antagonistic,
that anything like union under one sceptre,
without being tempered by the influence of
less excitable races, will be difficult in the
extreme. At present, her possession of nine
millions of Germans, is much more a source
of weakness than of strength. Prussia, in
any scheme of annexation she may contemplate,
or in any object she may have in view,
has only to show that it is for the interest of
Fatherland, and Austrian Germany is at once
alive to the necessity of paralysing the action
of its own Government, and assisting the
Prussian project. During the late war, it
was manifestly the interest of Austria to have
flung in her lot with France, but had she
done so, the first enemy whom she would
have had to encounter would have been her
German subjects. The mode in which she
clung to our garments during the struggle,
and like a child with its nurse, interceded
with us to interfere between the combatants,
when she dared not interfere herself, was a
glaring instance of the timidity arising out
of her weakness. When we remember the
boldness of Metternich before Napoleon I.,
and how Maria Theresa, yet bleeding from
the loss of Silesia, confronted the united
hostility of France and Prussia, we are
astonished at the pusillanimity which Austria
displays, even in her present stage of decrepitude.
In 1866, though backed by nearly all
the military forces of the Confederation, she
suffered herself to be prostrated by Prussia,
and her imperial mantle to be stript from
her in a few weeks. It is therefore not
from such a Power that any help can come,
when Prussia in the name of Germany finds
her way to the seaboard of the Northern
Ocean, or when the Russian Emperor and
his ally choose to realize any little plans
they may have concerted, with a view of
bringing Turkey within the sphere of European
civilization.</p>

<p>The position of France is much more
desperate than that of Austria, though the
compact unity of her race holds out a better
prospect of her recovering some portion of
her former strength. This, however, if it
occurs, will not be, at least, in our generation.
We must, therefore, regard the course
affairs may take during the next twenty
years, as if she was not in existence, at least
as a controlling power. It is not the effect
of the material, so much as of the moral,
ruin of the French nation which has to be
feared. Before the German armies passed
through the defiles of the Vosges, the corruption
of the Second Empire had done its
work in effeminating the character of a gallant
people. The mode in which the Army
of the Rhine left the capital of France for
the frontier, animated with the spirit of conquest,
and glittering with all the vain conceit
of anticipated triumph, and the mode
in which that proud host was rolled back,
never halting for a moment until fortressed
walls afforded them some respite from their
pursuers, can be paralleled only by the bluster
of those armies of old, who under Mardonius
and Hippias came to wreck all the
pride of Persia against the gates of Greece.
The spirit of a nation must be entirely emasculated,
its prowess gone, when the flower
of its soldiery can surrender in masses of
hundreds of thousands to an enemy in numbers
hardly superior; and when the great
body of the army can be allowed to be shut
up for nearly two months in a fortress, without
making any decisive attempt to cut
through a line of weaker proportionate
strength, and without the country so much
as putting up a finger to relieve them. The
capitulations of Sedan and Metz, consigning
the famous Imperial Guard, which so often
restored the fluctuating fortunes of France
under Ney and Cambronne, and 300,000
soldiers to the hulks of Germany, there to
be employed as beasts of burden and helots,
make us almost blush at the name of Frenchmen.
Such shameful surrenders are hardly
equalled by the masses of barbarous Cossacks
under Peter the Great, whom Charles XII.
netted like shoals of fish in the Ukraine. If
the Republican armies did not conduct themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
so ignominiously, it cannot be forgotten
that the strategy of Chanzy and Faidherbe
was disconcerted by the Mobiles flinging
down their arms at the critical moment,
and exhausting in a panic-flight energies
which ought to have been employed against
the enemy. Even in the Paris sorties, after
the tide had spent its strength, more soldiers
surrendered themselves than the Germans
cared to make prisoners. It also speaks
volumes for French military degeneracy, that
the German armies were permitted, for four
months, to go through the dilatory process
of strangling Paris, by famine, without a
single attempt being made to interrupt their
two lines of communication with Germany,
except a bold but abortive one by Ricciotti
Garibaldi, when, had the country by foraging
parties constantly directed its energies to
this end, they might have placed the besieging
armies in the same plight as the besieged.
If the French justly complain of the physical
prostration to which the plundering and
huckstering propensities of the Germans
have reduced France, this mischief is nothing
in comparison with the moral prostration to
which their submission to twenty years of a
corrupt despotism has brought the country.
The injury inflicted by the foreigner, they
may in a few years partially retrieve, but the
evil they have inflicted on themselves is
likely to be of a far more permanent character.
The fact is, France can never show her
face in the arena of foreign diplomacy, much
less appear in the front rank again, until she
probes her weaknesses to the bottom, and
eliminates the causes which have so powerfully
contributed to cast the nation, like a
bleeding and mangled carcase, under the
heel of Prussia. Perhaps the most destructive
of these, is the number of hostile factions
into which her population is split, each
clamouring against the other, with a hatred
ever ready to burst out into civil conflict.
In France, Republicanism is arrayed against
Monarchy, and each of these parties admits
of infinite subdivisions, arrayed against each
other. Legitimist, Constitutionalist, and
Imperialist, represent the monarchical element.
But the Bonapartist entertains not a
greater hatred to the Orleanist, than the
Socialist entertains to the Conservative Republican.
Then, the priest-party in the
country has a thorough abhorrence of the
free-thinking Democrat of the town. It
cannot be denied, that during the late war,
these factions did much to paralyze the energies
of the country. The Republican party
had little sympathy for the armies which
were overthrown at Woerth, and sent into
captivity at Sedan. The priest-party had as
little sympathy for the raw levies which
Gambetta sent to be mown down like unresisting
grass, under Chanzy and Bourbaki.
The energy of the nation was constantly
divided against itself. Its heart was never
thoroughly enlisted against Germany in any
part of the struggle. The country wanted a
common hope, a united faith, a solidarity of
principle to champion it in the struggle.
Until these miserable feuds are terminated,
we see little hope for France. For,
they reduce the country to the same
state of imbecility, which rendered Poland,
fifty years previous to her extinction,
of no account in Europe. That they will
entirely disappear we have little hope. But
that they will be very considerably diminished
by the galling chastisement which
Prussia has inflicted, is what we try to believe,
although the events which have transpired
in Paris during the last fortnight, in
which the bloodthirsty cruelty and aimless
recklessness of the Paris mob have been met
by the miserable irresolution, divided councils,
and practical imbecility of the Versailles
government, almost destroy all reasonable
hope. It is just in proportion to the degree
in which hatred of Prussia, and the desire
of being revenged for the punishment she
has recently administered, shall diminish the
rancour of political factions and amalgamate
all the feelings and strength of the country
into one flood-tide of patriotism, that we
must look for the political regeneration of
France. Prussia, by the exorbitant demands
she has imposed, has certainly done her utmost
to bring about this result. She has
purchased the triumphs and security of to-day,
at the expense of future ages of misery
and retribution. But it is not consolatory
to think that, whatever may be her efforts,
so low is the present position of France,
that she must consent to remain a political
cypher during the present century, and that
her only means of recovering her position,
even as a first-class power, and of directing
her united energies and resources to that
end, is by renewing the struggle with her
relentless enemy.</p>

<p>That France in the school of adversity
will unlearn much of the frivolity and self-glorifying
spirit which has distinguished her
people during the Second Empire, is another
advantage which may be hoped rather
than expected from her recent disasters&mdash;an
advantage, indeed, which would confer as
many benefits upon herself as upon the
world. France, ever since the days of Louis
Quatorze, has been too much accustomed to
deem herself the arbitress of Europe. She
had come to recognise it as her peculiar mission
to open or shut the Temple of Janus,
and give peace or war to the world. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
her boast that not a gun could be fired off in
Europe without her consent. This had been
repeated so often, in later times, that not only
Frenchmen but mankind generally came
to believe it. The consequence was, that
when any restlessness was exhibited at the
Tuileries, foreign nations began to look at
their muskets, increase their armaments, and
prepare for eventualities. Nor will anyone,
who considers the exploits of the First Napoleon,
the marvels he accomplished in the
midst of a divided Italy and a dismembered
Germany, regard the belief as having no
foundation. But France, while trading on
the splendid reminiscences of the First Empire,
during the Second, completely lost that
daring and resolute spirit by which those
wonders had been achieved. While pandering
to all the foolish vanities, and indulging in
the hectoring and blustering swagger, generated
by the victories of the First Napoleon,
she had sunk in the slough of effeminacy all
that martial dash, that burning ardour, and
fearless courage which enabled her, against
overwhelming odds, to nail victory to her
standards at Marengo and Austerlitz. The
delusion under which she laboured, was not
surpassed by that of Greece, who, when debauched
by her Asiatic conquests, imagined,
in her struggles with the Roman Empire,
that she possessed the prowess of the heroes
who made such havoc with the Persian armies
at Marathon and Thermopyl&aelig;. The folly,
into which this delusion has betrayed her,
can only be measured by the colossal nature
of the task she undertook&mdash;a task before
which even the adventurous genius of Napoleon
would have quailed, that of defeating
upwards of forty millions of Germans armed
to the teeth, and united against her as one
man. The result must open her own eyes to
the hollow nature of her pretensions, quite
as much as it has undeceived the world. She
must now learn, if she would not be ridiculous,
since she cannot bring her deeds up to
the level of her words, to reduce her words
to the level of her performances. She must
for ever renounce all idea of military ascendancy
in Europe&mdash;an idea, the realization
of which has so often covered her with wounds,
and now has eclipsed all her glory. The cultivation
of a chastened spirit on the part of
France, the abandonment of her levity, the
manifestation of a proper sense of the humiliation
to which she is reduced, will doubtless
free the world from some nightmares, and
powerfully contribute to the rehabilitation of
the country. But the work is a question of
time. The change cannot be perceptibly
felt during the lifetime of the present generation;
and in the interim, before she can exercise
any marked influence on the course of
events, the keys of Europe may be fought
for, and the world's Empire given away.</p>

<p>When we contrast the past glories of
France, the height of power she attained, or
even the influence she might have exerted
under wise rulers over contemporary events,
with her present prostration and political
eclipse, it is impossible to over-estimate the
gravity of the crisis to humanity. A great
force has been struck out of the nations. A
power upon which during the last half century
we leaned for the enforcement of order,
and the progress of constitutional ideas in
Europe, has been removed. She is, at present,
as politically dead as if the Atlantic
wave rolled over Limoges, and crested the
Jura. Except England, which it is the fashion
to decry as selfish and sordid, her Crimean
and Abyssinian wars notwithstanding,
France was the only nation in Europe that
was chivalrous enough to fight for abstract
right, especially when it was endangered
among the Latin nations. It is owing to her
that Italy has become free, united, and independent.
The Poles always found in her the
resolute champion of their interests. Russian
ambition had nowhere a more uncompromising
enemy than the great people
whose political obsequies are now being celebrated
by illuminations in Berlin. It is true,
on a few occasions, led away by a false sense
of her own interest, her Government refused
to sanction the policy we recommended for
its adoption; and in the case of the Egyptian
suzerainty and the Spanish marriages,
moved exactly in a contrary direction. But
it may be safely affirmed that for the last
half-century, under every government France
has possessed, she has co-operated with our
own, in resisting aggression, and promoting
the triumph of constitutional principles in
every part of Europe. Under the united
flags of both countries, an independent kingdom
was founded in Greece. From 1830 to
1833 she assisted us to establish Belgium, to
promote constitutional government in Switzerland
and Piedmont, and to guard the infancy
of the constitutional monarchy of Spain.
In 1839, we united our efforts to extinguish
the feud between Mehemet Ali and the Porte.
We also joined our protests, when Russia
suppressed Warsaw, and Prussia and Austria
extinguished Cracow, just as we sent in our
united protests when these two powers made
their raid on Denmark. Our forces fought
together in 1827 to protect Greece from Turkey,
as in 1854 to protect Turkey against
Russia. The two Western nations were, as
regards force, the complements of each other.
What the one wanted to be complete, the
other had. Singly, they were impotent to withstand
any combination of despots; but united,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
they might have defied the world. Now
France is a wreck, and we stand isolated in
Europe. The head of the Latin nations lies
shattered in the dust; and the people whose
independence we assisted her to build up, are
unable by themselves to lift an arm, or to afford
any effectual barrier against aggression.
Their sole resource now is in England, who
stands alone, looking with dismay upon the
effacement of the two allies, upon whom she
mainly relied in her difficulties, and upon the
alliance of two military monarchies in Europe
who dominate the situation. It depends
entirely upon the attitude of Great Britain
during the next few years whether she surely
shall participate in the fate of her allies,
and abandon the world to a retrogressive policy;
or whether the <i>foyers</i> of freedom and
independence shall be kept alive in Europe;
and whether the spirit of justice and rectitude,
instead of that of rapacity and conquest,
shall sway the intercourse of nations.</p>

<p>For our part, it is not without some misgivings
that we look forward to the policy of
Great Britain, during the next thirty years.
We do not lose our faith in God, nor in the
power of right principles, nor do we mistrust
the indomitable spirit and resources of the
country when once fairly roused, disciplined,
and utilized with sagacity and skill. But of
late years there has been a growing party in
the State, who would confine the energies of
the Government to its own internal affairs;
who would withdraw it from active intervention
in European politics; who would employ
every shilling of our expenditure upon developing
the commercial resources of the country,
and who would not even prepare to resist
an enemy until they saw him actually
approaching our shores. The disciples of
this school, fortified by the principles of political
economy, refuse to see any other element
in our relations with foreign countries
than the mere ledger account of barter and
gain; and anything which suspends the traffic,
or withdraws the national energies into
other paths, is denounced by them as suicidal
to the national interests. War shatters
the doctrines of political economists. It is,
therefore, only natural they should attempt
to relieve us of warlike armaments and decry
military organization. There can be no
doubt that the Reform Bills of 1831 and
1868, by throwing power into the hands of
the great trading classes, have augmented the
strength of this party, until it weighs with
preponderating effect on the main-spring of
Government. We gladly admit the beneficial
influences of the changes which this
party have largely contributed to bring about,
in interior retrenchment and municipal reforms,
in the equalization of political privileges,
in the extension of education, in the
partial abolition of University Tests, in the liberation
of commerce from protective duties,
and of religion from State-Church endowments.
We heartily accord, moreover, with
its denunciations of the war spirit, as such.
But we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that
these benefits have not been unalloyed by some
admixture of evil. For, to the fact of our applying
all our energies in this direction, may
be traced the breakdown of our armies before
Sebastopol; the acceptance of the declaration
of Paris, which strips England of
one of its most potent weapons in naval warfare;
and the shameful abandonment of
Denmark in the affair of the Duchies, which
has given rise to three wars and to the present
complicated difficulties which we have to
face.<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> It even now is a question whether, if
Russia were to enter upon a new phase of encroachment
in the East, or Prussia were to
annex Holland, we could, or dare, interpose
with dignity and effect. Any joint scheme
of conquest pursued by these two military
monarchies, we might certainly as well hope
to resist, as a child might venture to arrest
an avalanche; and our individual incompetency
would, in the eyes of the governing
class, be a solid reason for not endeavouring
to solicit the aid of a series of disorganized
States who are weaker than ourselves. For
the last fifty years, our influence abroad has
depended very much on the martial spirit
and the indomitable pluck we displayed in
our struggles with the First Napoleon. But,
if we were now to enter upon a Continental
war of only one-fifth of the dimensions of that
we carried on against Napoleon, we should
find ourselves, without allies, as little competent
to support our former prestige, as the
French have lately found themselves to support
the prestige of the First Empire.</p>

<p>But the weakness of England lies not so
much in the ascendancy of the non-intervention
party, as in the hand-to-mouth policy
of the English Executive. Every question
of foreign policy is considered exclusively
on its own merits, and solely with relation
to the circumstances of the hour. It is
never considered as evolved out of the
events of the past, and linked with the impending
events of the future. The Minister,
instead of contemplating the question in its
philosophic bearings, surrounded with all
the lights which his lofty position enables
him to command, counts his majorities, feels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
the pulse of the nation through the organs
of the press, and decides upon adopting
that course which shall most contribute to
strengthen his power. In all these questions,
the necessity of preserving a Cabinet
is always paramount to that of saving a
nation. At this crisis, it is unfortunate we
have to do with States which pursue an
entirely opposite system. The foreign policy
of England fluctuates now in one direction,
and then in another, much at the mercy of
vulgar opinion, according to whatever whims
the Minister may have who happens to be
in power. But the foreign policy of Russia
and Prussia broadens out like a mighty
stream which unceasingly rolls its current in
one direction, and never ceases to return
with renewed effort upon any point where it
may have sustained a temporary defeat.
The policy of both Powers is one in act,
identical in principle, substance, and complexion.
It is the simple abnegation of
justice in the comity of nations. Since the
days of Peter the Great, and the first
Frederic, the policy of these two Powers
has been one of continuous annexation and
conquest. Prussia has no more intention of
arresting her course at the foot of the Carpathians,
than Russia at the foot of the
Caucasus. It behoves, therefore, the British
people to change their course, and adjust
their sails to the altered circumstances of
affairs. Nor is it less incumbent on Ministers
to be alive to the fact, that, though they
may receive their home policy from the dictates
of the people, it is their high sphere,
on all questions of foreign policy, to guide,
direct, create, and fashion the opinion of the
country. There may be a difference of
opinion as to how far the nation is bound to
uphold the principles of abstract justice and
right in its dealings with other Powers; but
there can be no difference of opinion upon
the obligation of maintaining these principles
with the greatest tenacity, wherever
their violation affects our interests. We
would claim the support of the most rabid
economist for the expediency of maintaining
our rank as a first-class Power, if upon no
higher principle than with a view to keep
open foreign markets for our goods, and to
prevent ourselves from being cut off from
the sources of our commercial prosperity.
A policy, which directed all the energies of
the country to its own internal affairs, might
be persisted in without radical injury, while
the political equilibrium was divided between
five States, each bent upon neutralizing its
neighbour's power by counter-checks and
balances; but the same policy pursued while
Europe is in the hands of two military monarchies,
apparently having only one game in
view, would be simple ruin to the nation.</p>

<p>We therefore regard the present Army
Organization Bill as a step in the right direction:
our only objection to it is, that it
does not go far enough. What the nation
wants is increased military efficiency, and
diminished expense. The Bill does not
secure the one, and only partially realizes
the other. We, however, are content to
proceed by steps, if we are only secure of
going in the right direction. Let us hope
this measure is only the prelude to a series
of others, which may increase our military
efficiency without increasing the military
burdens of the country. But union is
strength. The liberal States of Europe,
like the sticks in the fable, may be weak in
themselves, but they can easily become
strong by mutual alliance. The time is not
inopportune for a League among the smaller
States, based upon mutual defence from
attack, which, if it could not preserve peace,
might afford England, in conjunction with
her crippled allies, a fulcrum of support in
time of need. At all events, it is our duty,
besides attending to our military organizations
at home, to enter into closer relationship
with the independent States of Europe,
that if the autocrats of the North persist
in indulging their old freak of enriching
themselves at their neighbours' expense,
they may not find us unprepared to maintain
the power and greatness of this
country.</p>

<p class="p2 hang"><i>The Lives of the Lord Chancellors and Keepers
of the Great Seal of Ireland from the Earliest
Times to the Reign of Queen Victoria.</i>
By J. <span class="smcap">Roderick O'Flanagan</span>, M.R.I.A., Barrister-at-Law.
Two vols. Longmans.</p>

<p>These two handsome volumes are the result
of twenty-five years' almost continuous industry,
and they bear abundant testimony to the
variety and interest of the author's researches
and lucubrations. It was undoubtedly a bold
and happy resolution that led him to follow in
Lord Campbell's path, and attempt to accomplish
for the Lord Chancellors of Ireland, what
that successful lawyer and judge had already
done with such vigour, clearness, and liberality
for the Lord Chancellors of England. Mr.
O'Flanagan has certainly produced a work
which will command public attention from the
specially skilful manner in which he has furnished,
in connection with the personal biography
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
of the great lawyers, an almost continuous
review of Irish events, together with a thousand
traditionary reminiscences and anecdotes,
scandalous or praiseworthy, concerning the
Irish bar, from the earliest period. The portraits,
especially in the first volume, may be
rather indistinct; but, after all, the Lord Chancellors
of Ireland, for a period of about six
hundred years, stand before us with a remarkable
distinctness, in all their variety of opinion,
accomplishment, and character; the arrogant
churchman, the profound politician, the corrupt
judge, the staunch patriot, the fierce fanatic,
and the eccentric jester, all playing their parts
variously, and at times in a manner but little
consistent with the character of their sedate
and pacific avocations. The first Irish Chancellor
of whom there is any record is John de
Worchley, who received his appointment in
1219, in the reign of Henry III. Nearly
all the early Chancellors were Englishmen, as
well as prelates. Their courts were held in
Dublin Castle. Their salaries were originally
&pound;40 a year, exclusive of fees and perquisites;
now the income of the office is &pound;8,000 a year,
with a retiring pension of &pound;4,000. The greatest
of all the Irish Chancellors were certainly
Lord Clare and Lord Plunket, and Mr. O'Flanagan
not inappropriately devotes to their biographies
nearly two-thirds of the second
volume.</p>

<p>It is very evident to the most cursory reader
of this work, that the author is a very staunch
Roman Catholic, as well as a most patriotic
Irishman; but we should not on this ground
hold him disqualified for his present task, if
he discovered a general candour and impartiality
in those instances in which his religious
convictions are concerned. Unhappily, however,
in such cases, <i>surgit amari aliquid</i>. It would
be impossible for us to note all the evidences
of religious partizanship observable in the
pages of this extensive work; but we prefer to
direct public attention to a very bold though
unsuccessful attempt to vindicate the character
of one of the most detestable and unprincipled
judges who ever disgraced the Irish bench.
Mr. O'Flanagan has taken extraordinary pains
to wipe the stains from the character of Sir
Alexander Fitton, the Irish Lord Chancellor of
James II., who certainly appears in no enviable
light in the pages of Hume and Macaulay.
Though compelled to admit that he may not
be 'able to remove the stains altogether,' our
author is still bold enough to say, 'with
patience and perseverance, I have satisfied
myself that party prejudice originated or embellished
most of the original accusations.'
(Vol. i. p. 467.) The case is one of purely
historical evidence. Hume's reference to Fitton
is in these words:&mdash;Tyrconnell was now vested
with full authority, and carried over with
him as Chancellor, one Fitton, a man who was
taken from a jail, and who had been convicted
of forgery and other crimes, but who compensated
for all his enormities by his headlong
zeal for the Catholic religion. He was even
heard to say from the bench, that the Protestants
were all rogues, and that there was not
one among forty thousand that was not a traitor,
a rebel, and a villain.' Macaulay's account
is substantially the same; but he adds that
Fitton 'often, after hearing a cause in which the
interests of his church were concerned, postponed
his decision, for the purpose, as he
avowed, of consulting his spiritual director, a
Spanish priest.' Mr. O'Flanagan disposes of
these statements by affirming that both
these historians drew their representations
from the account of Fitton given in his
'State of the Protestants of Ireland during
King James's Government,' by Archbishop
King, of Dublin, an avowed enemy. Burnet,
however, in his 'History of his own Times,'
speaks of Tyrconnell and Fitton as 'not only
professed but zealous Papists,' and of Fitton
he says, he 'knew no other law but the king's
pleasure.' It is a very remarkable fact
that Plowden, the Roman Catholic historian,
in his 'Historical Review,' published long
after these works, does not make the slightest
allusion to Fitton, though if he had preserved
anything like the spirit of Mr. O'Flanagan, he
would not have allowed the memory of James's
Irish Chancellor to rot under the 'repulsive reproaches
of two centuries.' But we are fully
prepared to show that Dr. King did not speak
without book in charging Fitton with forgery.</p>

<p>It is not a matter of much consequence whether
Fitton was only 'one Fitton,' as Hume calls
him, or a descendant of one of the most aristocratic
families of Cheshire, as Mr. O'Flanagan,
on undoubted evidence, assures us. Neither
does anyone dispute the fact that he was convicted
of the crime of forgery, and lay several
years in prison. The question is, was he
guilty of the crime? Our author says&mdash;'There
is some doubt whether he was chargeable with
the guilt which has been so unsparingly imputed
to him;' but he cannot deny that a jury
of twelve men had no hesitation on their oath
in attaching forgery to his name. What, then,
are the facts of the case? These are recounted
at some length by Mr. O'Flanagan, following
the admirable and now rare 'County
History of Cheshire,' by Ormerod; but he
has not fairly followed his authority, as his
narrative omits passage after passage that
bears most hardly against Fitton. We are
also to remember that Ormerod's own authority
was a tract written in Fitton's own justification,
under the following title:&mdash;'A True Account
of the Proceedings in the several suits in Law
that have been between the Right Honorable
Charles Lord Gerard of Brandon and Alexander
Fitton, Esq. Published for general satisfaction
by a lover of truth. Hague: Printed
<span class="smcap">mdclxiii</span>. Small 4to, 49 pp.' There was also
another tract published, which, perhaps, Ormerod
never saw, under the title&mdash;'A Reply to
a Paper intituled, A New Account of the Unreasonableness
of Mr. Fitton's pretences against
the Earl of Macclesfield.' (British Museum,
Parl. Law Cases, vol. v., p. 117.) The facts of
the case as narrated in these tracts by Fitton's
friends, may be briefly described. Sir Edward
Fitton, who was childless, resolved in 1641,
after paying his debts and bequeathing legacies
to his sisters' children, to restore the ancient
entail of the Gawsworth estates, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
sealed it by indenture dated 9th Nov., 17 Car.,
on William Fitton, his next male kinsman,
the father of Alexander Fitton, the Irish Lord
Chancellor. In this settlement there was a
power of revocation. It is said to have been
confirmed by deed-poll, dated April 3, 18 Car.,
by Sir Edward Fitton, who died two years
after at Bristol. The allegation is that this
deed-poll was forged by Alexander Fitton, or,
at his instance, by Alexander Grainger. After
Sir Edward's death, his widow, Lady Fitton,
retained possession of Gawsworth as her jointure;
but on her death, after a series of lawsuits
instituted against the sisters of Sir Edward
Fitton, who were determined to retain
the estate, William Fitton succeeded in getting
Gawsworth into his possession, and his son,
Alexander, afterwards succeeded upon his
marriage in getting hold of all the property
by paying off a number of mortgages against
it. But nineteen years after Sir Edward Fitton's
death, as this tract states, his nephew,
Lord Gerard, produced a will bequeathing the
estates to himself, as the son of one of Sir
Edward's sisters; though it was stated, on the
other side, that immediately before his death,
Sir Edward said 'he would rather settle his
estate on Ned Fitton, the bonny beggar, than
on any one of his sisters' children.' The parties
then went to law, Alexander Fitton relying
on the deed-poll, and Lord Gerard maintaining
that it was not genuine. The High
Court of Chancery directed a trial at law to be
had at Westminster upon this special issue,
whether the deed-poll was the act of Sir Edward
Fitton or not; for it had been rumoured
that Lord Gerard's solicitor had prevailed
upon Abraham Grainger to swear that he had
forged Sir Edward's hand to the deed. The
question came on for trial; the deed was substantiated&mdash;to
use Ormerod's words&mdash;by the
evidence of Mr. Richard Davenport, Mr. Edmund
Barwick, and Mr. Thomas Smallwoods,
whose deposition was taken on his deathbed
by Mr. Edge, a clergyman; but the forgery
was, on the other hand, fully acknowledged by
Grainger himself, corroborated by the evidence
of Gifford and Wheeler; and it was also deposed
by Colonel R. Ashton,&mdash;Webb, Esq.,
Thomas Adams, Thomas Cotton, Captain Holland,
and others, that they had heard Mr. Fitton
confess that Grainger had forged a deed
for him for &pound;40. Depositions to Mr. Fitton's
character were taken, and three witnesses not
named are said to have sworn they had seen
the deed-poll before the time alleged for the
forgery. It was objected to Fitton that he
could not prove where he had the deed, or who
engrossed it; that it had not been mentioned
at the former trials or at Fitton's marriage;
and that the witnesses could not remember
where it was executed. The jury found that
the deed was forged. Now, let it be remembered
that this narration comes from the Fitton
party; and yet Mr. O'Flanagan holds
Fitton guiltless in the teeth of the verdict of
an independent jury in London, who heard
both sides of the case. But the narrative
does not end here. Processes were issued
commanding several of Fitton's witnesses to
appear before the King's Bench on an information
of perjury. Then, says Mr. O'Flanagan,
'Grainger, conscience-stricken, declared his prevarication
in a written document, stating that
he had not forged the deed; that this document
was signed in the presence of twelve or
thirteen gentlemen.' Our author's version of
Ormerod's history is singularly defective and
one-sided. Ormerod says that Grainger&mdash;according
to the tract&mdash;begged earnestly for an
opportunity of acknowledging his guilt to Fitton;
and, farther, did so before a citizen of
London, not named, and a kinsman of Fitton's,
not named; and then wrote a narrative which
he read before twelve or thirteen gentlemen.
But Ormerod says that these 'gentlemen'
'were all most probably in low situations, and
are in no way identified.' The narration itself
relates the most improbable circumstances,
as, for example, that in March, 1661, Grainger,
the narrator, was pulled off his horse, taken
before Sir Allen Aspley, who committed him
to the Gatehouse without examination; that he
was in danger of being murdered in his bed
by one Rowe; that he was threatened with
hanging, and with getting his hands cut off, if
he would not forge the will. Was there ever
such an improbable story? And yet Mr.
O'Flanagan passes over this statement in silence,
without referring to Ormerod's honest
judgment, that even the inference from Grainger's
facts is in favour of Lord Gerard, and
that the evidence of a perjured witness was
of no value unless corroborated by independent
testimony. We have good reason, then,
to believe that not only did Fitton secure the
forgery of the deed in the first instance, but
that he induced Grainger to issue his recantation
in the shape of the narration referred to.
For the House of Lords, immediately after its
publication, ordered two copies of it to be
burned, one at Westminster and another at
Chester, 'at such time as Lord Gerard should
appoint,' and inflicted the following severe
punishment on Fitton and three others:&mdash;'That
Alexander Fitton should be fined to his
Majestie in the summe of &pound;500; and should
be committed close prisoner to the King's
Bench Prison until he should produce Grainger,
and should find sureties for his good behaviour
during life; and that Edward Floyd, John
Cade, and John Wright (three of the witnesses),
should be committed to the Fleet during the
King's pleasure, and should, before their enlargement,
find sureties for their good behaviour
during life.' It is evident from this
very stringent proceeding of the House of
Lords that they connected Fitton very directly
with the disappearance of Grainger, and that
Grainger was either unable or unwilling to
come forward to stand the ordeal of a public
examination upon the circumstances of his recantation.</p>

<p>We submit, then, that Archbishop King&mdash;'with
all his hatred of Catholicity'&mdash;was perfectly
warranted in saying that Sir Alexander
Fitton was 'a person detected of forgery, not
only at Westminster and Chester, but likewise
fined by the House of Lords in Parliament'
(p. 65). Mr. O'Flanagan has no evidence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
to offer against Dr. King's further statement
that he was an inefficient and partial judge,
for the mere negative evidence that the Irish
bar did not express any dissatisfaction with
his decisions is not worth the slightest consideration.
He admits that Fitton did consult
one Dr. Stafford, a Popish priest, before giving
some of his decisions; but then Stafford was
made a Master in Chancery by the same power
that placed Fitton at the head of Irish law;
for, as King remarks, the Chancellor 'was
forced to make many needless references to
the Masters in causes that had no difficulty in
them.' Stafford, 'the learned and <i>loyal</i>,'
Mr. O'Flanagan calls him, may have been 'an
eminent doctor of the civil law,' but the Reverend
Master in Chancery who perished at Aughrim
in cheering on the courage of the Irish
troops was not exactly the person best fitted to
dispense justice in such critical times&mdash;side by
side, be it remembered, with Felix O'Neal,
another Master, son of Turlogh O'Neal, the
bloody rebel and murderer of 1641. We do
not believe, then, that Mr. O'Flanagan has
succeeded in the slightest degree in 'removing
the stain' upon the character of Fitton.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>Select Charters and other Illustrations of
English Constitutional History, from the
earliest times to the reign of Edward the
First</i>, arranged and edited by <span class="smcap">William
Stubbs</span>, M.A., Regius Professor of Modern
History. Oxford, at the Clarendon Press,
1870. Pp. xii. 531.</p>

<p>This volume is intended to be, primarily, a
'treasury of references; an easily handled
repertory of the <i>Origines</i> of English Constitutional
history; and, secondarily, a manual for
teachers and scholars, with a view to the first
purpose.' Professor Stubbs has collected 'in
it every constitutional document of importance
during the period which it covers;' and with a
view to the second, he has also 'pointed out the
bearings of the several documents on one another,
and on the national polity,' in his prefatory
remarks to each of them, 'supplying in
the introductory sketch, a string of connexion
and a continuous theory of the development of
the system.'</p>

<p>As 'the first traces of our national history
must be sought for, not in Britain, but in Germany&mdash;in
the reports given by C&aelig;sar and Tacitus
of the tribes which they knew;' reports in
which we have indeed a 'somewhat indistinct
picture,' yet 'one which when interpreted by
the clearer history of the later stages of the institutions
which are common to the Teutonic
race, does give a probable and consistent representation'
of them. The Professor's first extracts
are taken from the 'Commentarii' of one
of these authors, and the 'Germania' of the
other. These are followed by others taken
from Mr. Thorp's translation of the 'Ancient
Laws and Institutes of the Anglo-Saxons.' The
remainder of the volume consists of 'Select
Charters and Excerpts,' illustrated by carefully
selected passages from the chronicles of the
several periods, as well as by other historical
documents not easily accessible to any who
have not the command of a public library, and
some of which are to be read only in MS., all
bearing upon the 'long struggle of the constitution
for existence,' which terminated only with
the reign of Edward I. There are only two
documents of a later date given&mdash;the 'Petition
of Eight,' of 1628, and the 'Bill of Rights' of
1689; both of which are printed in an appendix.</p>

<p>Mr. Stubbs thus states his reasons for closing
his labours with the reign of the first Edward.
It is 'the period of time at which the nation
may be regarded as reaching its full stature. It
has not yet learned its strength, nor accustomed
itself to economise its power. Its first vagaries
are those of a people grown up, but
not disciplined. To trace the process by
which it learned the full strength of its organism,&mdash;by
which it learned to use its powers and
forces with discrimination and effect,&mdash;to act
easily, effectually, and economically,&mdash;or, to use
another metaphor, to trace the gradual wear of
the various parts of the machinery, until all
roughnesses were smoothed, and all that was
superfluous, entangling, and confusing was got
rid of, and the balance of forces adjusted, and
their action made manageable and intelligible,
and the power of adaptation to change of circumstances
fully realized, is the story of later
politics&mdash;of a process that is still going on, and
must go on as the age advances, and men are
educated into, wider views of government, national
unity, and political responsibility. We
stop, however, with Edward I., because the
machinery is now completed, the people are at
full growth. The system is raw, and untrained,
and awkward, but it is complete. The attaining
of this point is to be attributed to the defining
genius, the political wisdom, and the
honesty of Edward I., building on the immemorial
foundation of national custom; fitting
together all that Henry I. had planned, Henry
II. organized, and the heroes of the thirteenth
century had inspired with fresh life and energy'&mdash;(pp.
50, 51).</p>

<p>The value of the volume is considerably enhanced
by a glossary that might be extended
with great advantage, and especially so if made
to include the French and Anglo-Saxon words,
as well as the Latin ones, which are employed
in the body of the work. It would also be well
if in some cases the definitions were to be accompanied
by references and quotations after
the manner of Ducange. The learned Professor
would, moreover, render good service to
students and teachers alike, if he were to add
such explanatory notes to some of his excerpts
as he well knows how to compile. The volume
ought to be no stranger in any of our colleges,
and well deserves a place in the 'curricula' of
our public schools. It will not be without its
interest and its value also to the general
reader.</p>

<p>When the history of the war of 1870 comes to
be written, it will furnish scope for genius the
most various and the most profound. A greater
Jomini will be needed to elucidate the tactics
that decided greater battles than Borodino or
Austerlitz; to unweave for us the intricate web
of the great strategist's plans; to solve for us
the problem whether he is a superstition and a
fetish, reaping the glory sown by the organization
and <i>morale</i> of his troops, or the silent centre
from which was directed the regulated play
of such tremendous forces. But though the
time for the military critic or the philosophical
historian has not yet come, the events and
scenes of the war, as they photographed themselves
in the eye of the spectator, are full of
immediate interest, and demand for their adequate
description the highest order of picturesque
power. Probably no accounts of the
recent campaign so amply satisfied our modern
thirst for the picturesque as the letters written
to the <i>Daily News</i>. The moving panorama of
the battle-field, the scientific deploying of vast
masses, the heroism of attack or repulse, were
brought close to our eyes. The description of
the battle of Gravelotte reads like a page torn
out of Tacitus, and for awful vividness might
stand by the side of Thucydides' narrative of
the plague. So swiftly have events passed out
of chronicle into history, that the accounts of
the early battles of the war&mdash;Weissenburg,
W&ouml;rth, Forbach, will even now bear reperusal,
and contain much that in our hungry desire for
the salient facts was omitted at the first
reading. Till a spectator of the entire course
of the war shall fuse his impressions of
the moment with his mature reflections,
and produce a continuous living narrative of
the whole, these letters will probably remain
the best compendium of the history of the last
eight months. We may add that the republication
comprises many of the letters of the veracious
'Besieged Resident.' They are at least
amusing, and give the proper seasoning of farce
to the tragedy.</p>

<p>The 'Besieged Resident' remained in Paris
during the siege 'to enjoy a new sensation.' He
had new sensations in abundance; and generously
gave the British public, through the medium
of the <i>Daily News</i>, the benefit of his experiences.
They were sufficiently varied, for
he went in search of them&mdash;grotesque, for fidelity
to fact is not his strong point&mdash;and amusing,
for he is the liveliest of <i>persifleurs</i>. The personal
element in these letters was unquestionably
that which gave them their charm; the siege as
it affected the 'Besieged Resident,' rather than
the 'Besieged Resident' reporting on the siege,
seemed to be the subject of them. How his
clothes were held together by an infinity of
pins, how his boots had burst in half-a-dozen
places, and how horse did not assimilate with
his inner man, were facts which made the Philistine's
breakfast an interesting meal during the
siege. Now that the letters have been published
in a complete form, these important facts
seem less prominent, and we are able to recognize
the real value of the narrative as a history
of opinion&mdash;journalistic, Bellevilleite, and
<i>bourgeois</i>, during the four months of the investment.
The description is not flattering.
The 'Besieged' plays the part of valet to the
Parisian heroes, and sees very little of heroism
but a great deal of braggadocio. A somewhat
cynical temper perhaps lends some exaggeration
to mere common-place folly; but it seems certain
that the despicable traits and unworthy
actions of which the 'Besieged' is the chronicler
will have to be taken into account in any truthful
narrative of the great siege. On the whole,
it does not seem likely that the 'Besieged' will
be superseded in his self-assumed function by
any subsequent chronicler.</p>

<p>Captain Bingham is a more prosaic narrator
than the 'Besieged Resident,' but there was so
much to be seen that he has many incidents to
relate without touching on ground already occupied.
His book is a consecutive narrative of
facts, which are all the more trustworthy that
they take no colouring from the individuality of
the writer.</p>

<p>The 'Letters on the War' are of no evanescent
interest, but are a permanent contribution
to the literature of the subject. The writers of
them are the Titans of the Teutonic race, whose
clear duty it is to speak out, as the prophets of
old spoke out, in a great crisis of history.
Those of Dr. Strauss and Mr. Carlyle are the
most important historically, as they are also the
most interesting. Mr. Carlyle's historic retrospect
reaches back to Louis XI., and is meant
to show what a terribly bad neighbour France
has been to Germany for the last 400 years.
He describes the grand 'plunderings and incendiarisms
of Europe' by the French, and he believes
that Germany would be a 'foolish nation
not to think of raising up a secure boundary
fence against such a neighbour.' And why
should not Alsace and Lorraine be restored to
their original owners? The only titles of
France to them are the 'cunning of Richelieu
and the grandiose long-sword of Louis XIV.'
He has pity for France but no sympathy; acknowledges
her services to civilization and the
grandeur of her 'Insurrection against shams,'
in 1789; but believes that the German race is
now to be protagonist in the 'immense world-drama.'
Dr. Strauss's argument is, like Mr.
Carlyle's, historical, but with diminished perspective,
and from a different point of view. He
traces the history of the movement towards national
unity, travailing towards birth through
the obstructions of the reactionary despotisms,
planted by the diplomacy of Vienna, the abortive
revolution of 1848, and the apathy or despair
of all but the enthusiasts. He accepts
the creed of Bismark; unity could only be obtained
through force, as Hegel saw seventy
years ago.</p>

<p>In Mr. Greg's pamphlet and letters we admire
the dexterity of the practised swordsman,
whose convictions are chiefly a matter of
logic.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span></p>

<p>We might as well surrender at discretion to
Mr. Dixon. He is as confirmed in his ways as
we in our critical canons. What the late lamented
George Robins was among auctioneers&mdash;what
M. Jullien was among musicians&mdash;what
Dumas <i>p&egrave;re</i> was among novelists&mdash;what the
'besieged resident' is among newspaper correspondents&mdash;Mr.
Dixon is among historians;
<i>what</i> it is not easy to say. He alike provokes
and interests us. Our taste is offended; our
critical conscience protests. Murdered Clio,
like Banquo's ghost, sits in Mr. Dixon's place
and 'shakes his gory locks.' The meretricious
style&mdash;the superb magniloquence&mdash;the broad
statements&mdash;the highly coloured pictures&mdash;the
irrepressible affinities for what is coarse, make
us fume with impatience and exclaim with
anger: but we must read on; in spite of ourselves
we are interested, although with the uneasy
pleasure of a sin. We must, however, be
just. Whether it be that our taste has adapted
itself, or that Mr. Dixon has improved, we are
bound to say that in reading these volumes our
pleasure has been less alloyed, and has secured
a larger measure of our good conscience than in
reading any of his previous works. Some of
his descriptions are well toned in their brilliancy,
there are fewer catapult sentences, good
taste is less frequently violated, extravagances
of assertion are less daring, and altogether he
inspires greater historic confidence, and excites
more literary pleasure. Happily, however, we
are released from all reasonable obligation to
apply historic tests. Mr. Dixon tells us that he
has not 'cared to fret the reader by a dozen references
in every page to pipe-rolls, doquets,
warrant-books, and council registers.' Such
things, we admit, are encumbering; they are
vulgar, moreover, and altogether unworthy the
dignity of history, and are only temptations to
irreverent readers. It is pleasant to read a
well-printed page, undisfigured by a single reference,
to be unable to distinguish too nicely
between a 'doquet' and 'the caricatures' which
Miss Burdett Coutts has lent him. We read
'Her Majesty's Tower' as we read 'Kenilworth'
or 'Richard III.' If it be neither history
nor fiction, it is something better than
either, and it is well by the absence of all
references to be released from the responsibility
of determining which. Mr. Dixon certainly
does possess considerable narrative and descriptive
ability. His literary art is great. He
cannot be dull. Whether he also possesses patient
power of historical research, and a judicial
faculty of exact presentation, we have no
means of judging; but it is conceivable that
with these, combined with adequate scholarship,
he might have trodden not unworthily in the
footsteps of Macaulay. We regret that he has
chosen to write after the fashion of the <i>Daily
Telegraph</i>&mdash;to lay himself out for sensations&mdash;the
result of which is a series of volumes which
might have been brilliant history, but which
are only sensational articles.</p>

<p>In the range of these volumes Mr. Dixon
is essentially a free lance. The first of the
two is almost entirely occupied with George
Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, the infamous
favourite of our British Solomon, and with the
base intrigues and dirty scandals of his court,&mdash;why
it is impossible to say, inasmuch as,
except that some of his victims were imprisoned
in it, Villiers had no more to do with
her Majesty's Tower than Macedon had with
Monmouth, nor so much, for Villiers does not
begin with a T. It is, in fact, a romance of
Whitehall, of which Villiers is the hero. And
it is by no means a clean one; that under any
circumstances it could hardly be, but, as Mr.
Dixon tells it, it is like a bad dream. Throughout
we feel the evil suggestion. Mr. Dixon
seems to delight in keeping us on the verge of
nastiness, and to have peculiar unction in
reiterating such offensive epithets as the one he
applies to Dean Williams. We think that the
dirty intrigues and unsavoury stories with
which the author of 'Spiritual Wives' has
filled this section of his work might, without
much detriment to our knowledge of either
history or social manners, have been left in
the obscure records from which they have
been culled. The career of Villiers, the son of
a poor knight, who began life as an amateur
comedian, and in that character pleased the
pedantic voluptuary James, and was rapidly
elevated through a succession of offices and
dignities until, when he fell beneath Felton's
knife, he was Duke of Buckingham and the
most potent courtier in England, is an inseparable
part of the history of England; and the
shameless corruption and profligacy of James's
court, of women like the 'parent,' as Mr.
Dixon chooses to label the mother of Villiers,
and indeed of almost every circle of fashionable
life, are as vitally connected with the
convulsions that followed, as the Courts of
Louis XIV. and XV. are with the French
Revolution. But what connection there is
between the details of Buckingham's rascality
and of his mad escapade into Spain with Prince
Charles, and the Tower of London, passes our
comprehension. The only pretence of a connection
is, that on the safe arrival at home of
Buckingham and the Prince certain prisoners
in the Tower were liberated. Williams, who
was first a Welsh curate, and then, as the reward
of being a hateful pander, was exalted to
be first Dean of Westminster, and ultimately
Archbishop of York, is a despicable character,
and history will not qualify Mr. Dixon's
portrait of him. 'Little Laud' was made use
of by 'the parent' as his successful rival. He
was destined to play a part in the tragedy
which followed that he little dreamed of.</p>

<p>In Eliot, Mr. Dixon has a genuine hero of
the Tower. His account of him is almost unexceptionable,
only, one remembers that here
he had the advantage of the previous labours
of Mr. Forster. Eliot, for his fearless and incorruptible
patriotism, endured a long imprisonment
in the Tower. He died in it&mdash;one
of its noble army of martyrs. For seven
years after his death, as is well known, no
Parliament was called in England. Mr. Dixon
in trying to be magniloquent is almost profane
when he tells us that of this period 'Wentworth
was the State, Laud was the Church,
and Charles was God.'</p>

<p>The fourth volume is much more relevant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
to Mr. Dixon's theme. We could have spared
the catalogue of names with which, after the
manner of Homer's list of ships, it opens, and
which is an amusing instance of the sonorous
effects which Mr. Dixon delights to produce;
but the volume is, on the whole, satisfactory.
The instances are well selected. The dramatic
skill with which his heroes are presented is
great. The interest is legitimately sustained,
and we are really gratified to be able to speak
highly of the whole. We cannot follow him
in detail. Our sympathies are most interested
in the visionary politico-philosopher James
Harrington, the author of 'Oceana,' the sorrowful
victim of idiotic fears, whose political
prevision, Mr. Forster's Ballot Bill, after two
centuries, is just about to realize. Mr. Dixon
rapidly sketches, as heroes of the Tower, the
second Buckingham&mdash;the Duke of Richmond,
who was guilty of falling in love and eloping
with the king's mistress&mdash;the Earl of Castlemaine,
who connived at the unfaithfulness of
his wife, and died a monk&mdash;the two Penns&mdash;the
romantic story of Colonel Blood&mdash;the mysterious
tragedy of the Earl of Essex&mdash;the
martyrdom of Lord Russell, and of Algernon
Sydney&mdash;the execution of the Duke of Monmouth&mdash;the
lurid tragedy of Judge Jeffreys&mdash;the
death of Laud&mdash;the fate of the Scottish
Jacobites&mdash;the romantic escape of Lord Nithsdale&mdash;the
imprisonment of Sir Francis Burdett&mdash;and
the finis to the prison history of the
Tower in the anti-climax of the Cato street
conspirators.</p>

<p>We wish Mr. Dixon had treated his really
great epical subject with more dignity and with
better taste. His powers of picturesque narration
and of vivid portraiture are great: is
it too late to ask him to employ them upon
better themes, and to subdue them to great
purposes?</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>Annals of Oxford.</i> By J. C. <span class="smcap">Jeafferson</span>.
2 vols. Hurst and Blackett.</p>

<p>There is, perhaps, no subject on which a
book of pleasanter and more instructive gossip
could be compiled than the English universities.
Their origin and early constitution are
excessively vague and uncertain, and are
therefore a source of perpetual interest to the
antiquary. It is known that they came into
existence as part of that intellectual revival
which is coupled with such names as Anselm
and Abelard, and that the first notices of their
activity represent them as vigorous institutions.
As soon as the colleges, which are
special characteristics of English academical
history, are founded, information as to the
domestic life of these ancient corporations
begins, and is continued uninterruptedly to
our own time. The materials for the annals
of Oxford and Cambridge are copious, and
such annals, were the facts carefully selected
and well arranged, would be an exceedingly
valuable addition to the social history of this
country. Few people, for example, are aware
of the very important part which Oxford
played in the incipient reformation of Wyckliffe
in the fourteenth, and in the revival of
tithes under Erasmus, More, and Colet at the
conclusion of the fifteenth, centuries; or of
the refuge which both Universities, but especially
Cambridge, afforded to the leaders of
Puritanism in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries. Nor are there many persons who
are alive to the fact that the legislation of the
Restoration, which tied both these great institutions
down to a political system, under
which the Established Church was made the
slave of the State and the gaoler of the mind,
degraded and demoralized both Oxford and
Cambridge.</p>

<p>Mr. C. Jeafferson has some pretensions to
the reputation of a good gossip. He has compiled
certain amusing books about the professions
of law, physic, and divinity. In an evil
hour he was tempted to risk this reputation,
and to write a book about Oxford. He has
succeeded in producing one of the worst specimens
of book-making which has ever been
put before the public. To call these two
volumes the 'Annals of Oxford' is a gross
abuse of words, for they are not annals in any
sense whatever. A few facts are culled from
very familiar authors, such as Anthony Wood
and Gutch, and are diluted with a prodigality
of verbiage to which no experience of ours can
find a parallel. The most important parts of
academical history are omitted, as for example
the contest between the University and the
Archbishop of Canterbury, in which Oxford
supported Wyckliffe against prelate and pope,
and succumbed only when she was threatened
with the loss of her franchises. The reader is
treated to an account of the origin of the University,
for which there is neither authority nor
probability, for throughout the two volumes the
author is utterly without any information
of what the University has been or is, notwithstanding
his boast that he 'knows nearly
everything about Oxford in the dark ages.'</p>

<p>But the most serious offence which the book
commits is not its omission of important facts,
or its intolerable dilution of unimportant ones,
or its misapprehension of the whole subject,
but its incessant vulgarity. There is hardly
a page in the two volumes where we do not
find examples of that slangy familiarity of expression
which passes with some people for
wit or humour, and which in pretending to
avoid dulness is the dullest of all sins against
good taste. Mr. C. Jeafferson's contribution
to the history of Oxford is wholly without
value, and for the sake of the writer's reputation
as a collector of gossip and anecdote, the
kindest wish which a reviewer can make him
is that the 'Annals of Oxford' may be speedily
forgotten.</p>

<p>Very few men in the history of the world

His mode of expression, on the rare

occasions when he did speak, was pointed and
happy. His reports and professional correspondence
were models of clear perspicuous
terseness. But he felt that his works were
the true witnesses as to his character; and
to their silent and enduring testimony he
was content to commit his fame. Though he
was made as often as any public man of his
day the object of frequent and unsparing
attack, he rarely offered any verbal reply,
restrained by that proper pride in his own

modest volume, brings briefly to the notice of
the public. There is evidence that Mr. Isambard
Brunel has been a pupil in his father's
school. He has confined his work within
limits only too narrow for the actual magnitude
of the subject. Very often, by the simple
form of abstracted chronicle which he uses,
as in describing the launch of the <i>Great
Eastern</i>, he does more to silence slander and
to terminate controversy, than could have
been effected by the most eloquent advocacy.
Still, we could wish he had allowed his pen
fuller scope. We should like to have heard
more of the inner life of so remarkable a man,
to have had the taste gratified by illustrations
of his refined and graceful fancy, and to have
had the magnitude of his works brought into
fuller relief by a more minute description of
his unsleeping toil, his unflagging and audacious
originality, and his conscientious effort
to bring all his designs and every detail of their
execution to the sternest test.</p>

<p>It is easy for those who have a mere newspaper
acquaintance with Mr. Brunel to sneer
at the education attained by the engineer at
the expense of his shareholders. At the commencement
of the railway system in this country
something of the kind was inevitable in the
case of every leading engineer. The great
features on which the success of the railway
system mainly hinged were not arrived at by
scientific deduction. The speed which George
Stephenson estimated at sixteen miles an hour&mdash;viz.,
the velocity attained by some of the
most rapid coaches of the period&mdash;was raised
to from twenty to thirty miles an hour, in the
first instance, by Captain Ericsson (the inventor
of the Monitor), in conjunction with the
late Mr. John Braithwaite. During the experimental
trials on the Liverpool and Manchester
Railway, the Novelty, the engine built by these
engineers, passed by the Rocket, that of the
Messrs. Stephenson, like a shot. The ill-constructed
four-wheel engines of Mr. Bary,
with which the London and Birmingham line
was opened, were constructed for a moderate
rate of speed. From those which, of his own
design, Mr. Brunel put on the Great Western
Railway, he obtained a speed equal to that
of the flight of the swallow&mdash;from sixty to
seventy miles an hour. A level portion of
line between London and Slough was daily
traversed by the express trains at this high
speed.</p>

<p>While the forethought of Mr. Brunel&mdash;which
added fifty per cent. to the accommodation
afforded by his lines of railway for the future
traffic of the country&mdash;doubled the speed of
his own trains, it further compelled the
narrow-gauge lines, by the use of the long six-wheeled
engines, materially to increase theirs.
The sagacious genius of the engineer was
evinced yet more splendidly in the services he
rendered to navigation. Of oceanic steam
traffic Mr. Brunel may justly be called the
father. In July, 1837, the <i>Great Western</i>
steamship was launched at Bristol, and in
April of the following year she arrived at New
York, after a journey of nine days, with a
fourth of her coal unconsumed. The <i>Sirius</i> was
built by the St. George's Steam Packet Company
expressly to anticipate the <i>Great Western</i>,
so that by sea as well as by land Mr. Brunel
effected almost as much by the emulation he
awoke as by his own energy and toil. The
<i>Sirius</i> arrived at New York a few hours only before
the <i>Great Western</i>, having consumed every
combustible on board, down to a child's doll!
The measured tonnage of the <i>Great Western</i>
was 1,340 tons; that of the <i>Great Britain</i>,
launched at Bristol in July, 1843, was 3,443
tons; that of the <i>Great Eastern</i>, launched in
the Thames on 31st January, 1858, was 13,343
tons. It was thus that the cautious shipwright
felt his way before developing the full
magnitude of his conceptions.</p>

<p>For the account of his further works&mdash;his
docks and harbours, his bridges and viaducts,
his investigation of projectiles and of screw
propulsion, his admirable military hospital for
the Crimean expedition, his general professional
practice&mdash;we must refer our readers to
the volume now before us. All those who
regard the civil engineer as a sort of typical or
central workman, and who therefore are prepared
to measure our future progress in applied
science and industrial art by the scale afforded
by the condition of this profession in
England, will do well to read with care this
very interesting book.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>Memoir of George Edward Lynch Cotton,
D.D., Bishop of Calcutta; with Selections
from his Journals and Correspondence.</i>
Edited by Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cotton</span>. Longmans, Green,
and Co. 1871.</p>

<p>In this volume Mrs. Cotton has given to the
world a memorial of the late Bishop of Calcutta,
which by those who personally knew
him, and also knew English life in India, will
be read with peculiar interest. The scattered
nature of their dioceses, the varieties of claims
which they have to meet, the consecration of
churches, and the confirmation of candidates,
compel the dignitaries of the English Church
in India to travel frequently and far; and, as
metropolitans over the entire empire, the Bishops
of Calcutta journey more frequently and
to greater distances than their colleagues. A
large portion of this memoir is devoted to the
details of such journeys; and the descriptions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
of places, persons, and incidents, coming fresh
from the ripe, scholarly, and cheerful mind of
one who saw Indian scenes and manners for
the first time, give to it a peculiar charm.
The extracts from the Bishop's journals and
letters are numerous, perhaps too numerous
and extended; and the connecting links, now
detailing important facts, and at another time
discussing the bearings of some great question,
are written with clearness and power.</p>

<p>The vein of humour which ran through
Bishop Cotton's mind enabled him to discern
the lively and especially the burlesque aspect
of the scenes through which he passed, whether
in school and college days, or amid the serious
labours which closed his life. At Rugby
he named the fat denizen of his sty Vitellius;
at Cambridge he would class his personal
friends in an imaginary <i>tripos</i>, and award them
medals and honours which expressed his estimate
of their worth; and his letters to his
children and old friends are full of the amusing
side of native life.</p>

<p>With many things to interest him, the reader
cannot but be disappointed at the book. It is
almost entirely confined to the few years of
Bishop Cotton's episcopate. At page 68 he has
already left England for his Eastern diocese at
the age of forty-nine; and the story of the
next eight years occupies five hundred pages.
All we can learn of the mental and moral
growth of his English life, of his distinguished
career as an educator, and of the remarkable
position which he early attained among the
foremost clergy of the English Church, is contained
in the first three chapters of the memoir
by Dean Stanley, with the beautiful notices of
his work and influence by Professor Shairp
and the late Professor Conington. Yet his
early career deserves to be described as fully
as that of Dr. Arnold, who loved him so well,
whom he so greatly resembled, and to whose
position as an educator he practically succeeded.
These early years made him what he was&mdash;a
careful scholar, a man of active, earnest
piety, an intense lover of truth, a man of large
mind and broad sympathies.</p>

<p>We took occasion, soon after the bishop's
death in October, 1866, to express in these
pages our high estimate of his worth and usefulness,
and his views on the important questions
with which in his brief episcopate he had
to deal are fully set forth in Mrs. Cotton's narrative.
His long but most interesting travels;
his concern for the isolated English communities
in India; his care for the spiritual interests
of the English soldiery; his opening the consecrated
Episcopal Churches to the use of the
Presbyterian regiments; his charges to the
clergy; his deep interest in the Episcopal missions,
in the raising up of a native ministry,
and in measures for the relief of native converts,
such as their <i>Re-marriage Act</i>; his
efforts to establish schools for East Indian
children, are fully and carefully discussed.
But while illustrating in many ways Bishop
Cotton's large-hearted sympathies and the
broad views which he took of men and things,
the memoir fails to show how in religious matters
he looked with deep interest on other
Christian communities than his own, was prepared
to do them full justice, and held the
most kindly and unpatronizing intercourse
with prominent members among them. A man
of deep, sterling piety, an evangelical preacher,
a faithful minister and bishop of his Church, a
lover of good men, he well deserves the high
position now accorded to his name by the members
of the Church of England; and long will
he be remembered with esteem and regard by
men of many communions who outside her
own pale are striving to evangelize India.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>Some Memorials of Renn Dickson Hampden,
Bishop of Hereford.</i> Edited by his daughter,
<span class="smcap">Henrietta Hampden</span>. Longmans, Green,
and Co.</p>

<p>Time brings its revenges, but not always
repentance or wisdom. The Dissenters are to
be admitted to the University, and the intelligence
and good sense of the country&mdash;the
dogmatic intolerance of such men as made Dr.
Hampden a martyr alone excepted&mdash;heartily
approve. He is justified as a man more foresighted
and just than many of his contemporaries,
and his persecutors are relegated to
that limbo of conscientious intolerance into
which all claimants of arrogant prerogative and
all obstinate conservatives are cast. Dante
should have devised a retribution for non-jurors,
or Vathek should have represented them as
melancholy ghosts with their hands upon their
hearts and ceasing not to sigh out their <i>non
possumus</i>. Opponents of every liberal advance
in Church and State rudely swept into eddies
by the stream of time, their characters are
most heterogeneous and their labour very great.
The forty bullet-headed Protectionists of the
Free-trade reform, the Bourbons who 'forgot
nothing and learned nothing,' the bereaved
patrons of rotten boroughs&mdash;to say nothing of
Laud and his school of divine right, of the
good old times of the Star Chamber, of the
Five-mile Act, of the Test and Corporation
Acts, of Roman Catholic disabilities, of Church-rates,
and the Irish establishment&mdash;must surely
bemoan themselves very bitterly either because
they maintained right in vain, or because they
opposed it in vain. And yet inherent Toryism
will not learn wisdom. The opponents of the
Test Repeal Act are, in the present Parliament,
repeating as blindly and as fatuously the follies
of their predecessors. Miss Hampden tells
the story of her father's noble testimony, for
really while his actual life was much more than
this, there is little more about it to tell.
Learned, pious, candid, orthodox, conservative,
reverently, and, as we should now say, almost
timidly jealous for revealed truth, anything
but a man of advanced opinions generally,
Bishop Hampden was the object of a virulent
and most unscrupulous persecution, such as
must ever be the dark reproach of any Church
or party whose polemical passions can make
them capable of it. His sin was that he was
strongly opposed to the Tractarian movement.
He was too honest and honourable to be moved
by this hostility from his position, although
his scholarly and benevolent and sensitive life
was embittered by it. He lived to see himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
vindicated, and now the public opinion of England
is about to endorse the clear-sightedness,
candour, and justice of his advocacy. Of his
great theological learning and catholic heartedness,
there is no need to speak. The memoir,
although not very skilfully put together, is an
interesting and touching memoir of a very
noble man.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>The Life and Times of Lord Brougham.</i> (Written
by himself.) Edinburgh: W. Blackwood
and Sons.</p>

<p>Though the space of time covered by this
first volume of Lord Brougham's Memoirs was
one of the most interesting in his own life, and
one of the stormiest in European history, the
narrative is languid, and contains no facts that
are at once new and important. Indeed, his
Lordship had been already forestalled by notable
contemporaries, who had been seized more
or less strongly with the autobiographical passion,
and also by the fact that the earlier portion
of his life had long passed into the region
of history. What novelty the volume possesses
it derives chiefly from musty journals of
travel and political correspondence of evanescent
interest. To be admitted to the spectacle
of Opposition wire-pulling three-quarters of a
century ago, and to be favoured with the rapid
observations on transitory things of a hasty
traveller, are benefits that were perhaps overrated
by Lord Brougham. Had he been a
philosophical observer, or possessed the power
of picturesque description, he might have left
behind him an enduring record of great and
historical events, <i>quorum pars magna fuit</i>,
which he had the double advantage of seeing,
as it were, in the making, and also after they
were reduced to their natural proportions by
the perspective of many added years. That,
however, we have no right to expect from
Lord Brougham. As it is, there are some
minute personal touches in the narrative which
are at least curious. He attributes his enormous
energy and success to the Celtic blood
in his veins; very probably it accounts for his
instability. He gives a shocking account of
his grandfather's funeral, as an instance of the
barbarous manners of the time, though, unhappily,
it is far from having died out. He redescribes
the origin of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>,
declaring that Sydney Smith's account of it is
entirely imaginary, although he substantially
confirms it; and he gives as his own, a satirical
tale, which, it has been pointed out, is translated
from the 'Candide' of Voltaire. We
shall have more to say about both the autobiography
and the man when the publication is
complete.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>The Life and Travels of George Whitefield, M.A.</i>
By <span class="smcap">James Paterson Gledstone</span>. Longmans
and Co.</p>

<p>The character and power of Whitefield must
ever be a study of interest to persons who
either as religious men or as historical students
attach importance to the evangelical revival
of the last century; and in proportion as
it recedes into the past, as contemporary passions
and their inspirations die out, and especially
as the arrogant assumptions of a dominant
Church are discredited, the study will have increased
interest and recognised importance.</p>

<p>Several lives of Whitefield have been attempted,
some of which we would rather not
characterize. Mr. J. P. Gledstone is generously
reticent concerning them. He makes no allusion
to the labours of his predecessors, but
simply tells his story with all the lights that
are available. Nothing in Whitefield's character
or history or work turns upon the discoveries
of the antiquarian. The broad facts are
adequately known, and the work of the biographer
is to recite and interpret them. Mr. J. P.
Gledstone has produced what, we think, will
prove the standard life of Whitefield. His
sympathies are catholic, and he does justice to
the noble soul of Whitefield, who was the
'brother of all who in every place, and under
every denomination, call upon the name of the
Lord Jesus Christ. I have striven to put the
man rather than his creed upon the pages of
this book.' Whitefield was no theologian; he
was simply a great preacher. His Calvinism
was passionate rather than dogged, and in an
inappreciable degree influenced his preaching.
His great soul yearned for the salvation of men,
and the more arduous the service the more
attractive to him it was.</p>

<p>Into the merit of his great preaching power,
however, we cannot now enter, and yet both
now and at all times it is a study of the most
vital moment to the Church. Mr. J. P. Gledstone's
book throws upon it all the light that
circumstance and fact can furnish, and intelligently
suggests most of the deeper psychological
and spiritual causes. We very cordially
commend this carefully-studied and admirably-written
life of the Chrysostom of England.</p>

<p>Here are three more of the numerous and
excellent works which in recent years have
sought to illustrate in full detail the course and
the fruits of missionary labour in India. They
are valuable additions to the missionary library,
and each will occupy a position of its own.
Instead of dealing with the Indian empire at
large, both Mr. Abbs and Mr. Mateer restrict
themselves to the single province of Travancore.
The work of Mr. Abbs recounts the
missionary experience of twenty-two years,
and is characterized by sound sense, extreme
modesty, and deep religious feeling. Much
valuable information is given on the relations
between the mission in Travancore and the
native government, and some fresh light is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
thrown on the whole question of caste as encountered
by Christian missionaries in Travancore.
In the same region Mr. Mateer spent
nine years, and endeavours to render his little
work a complete handbook of all necessary information
respecting that district and its people.
This information has been drawn in part
from authoritative records, and in part embodies
the results of the writer's own observation
and inquiry during the period of his daily
life within the province. The book is written
in a simple unpretending style, and will amply
repay perusal.</p>

<p>Travancore, called by the Brahmins the Land
of Charity, or Piety, is a secluded province
in South-western India, peculiarly devoted to
Hinduism. Though occupied to a very large
extent by aboriginal tribes, some of which
must be of very ancient origin, many centuries
ago it was religiously conquered by some prominent
members of the Brahminical caste, and
they have ever since retained the firmest hold
upon its rulers and its people. All the wealth
and prosperity of this well-watered and fertile
corner of India have been poured into their
lap, and the lower castes and aboriginal races
have been their devoted serfs. Closely walled
in by mountains and by the sea, it has had
comparatively little intercourse with its immediate
neighbours, and scarcely any with the
more distant districts of South India. Its
reigning family has long been seated on the
throne; and Mr. Mateer describes the religious
position occupied by its princes, and the strange
ceremonies which both establish their sanctity
and secure to the priests and Brahmins abundant
rewards. Mr. Mateer also pictures the
numerous races and classes which make up its
million and a half of inhabitants, and explains
the immoral causes and condition of things
under which, in one caste especially, all property
is made to descend to nephews and not to
sons.</p>

<p>While describing fully the physical features
and productions of the province, he dwells especially
upon its religious aspects, and gives
much information concerning the life and customs
of the Sh&#257;nar and Ilavar races, who in
religion are devil-worshippers. It is amongst
them that Christianity has made special progress
during the present century. While the
princes and nobles have been growing in knowledge
and experience of their English rulers,
the lower tribes have in great numbers accepted
the Gospel. The story of the mission
planted among them is given at length, and illustrations
are presented of the fruits which
they have produced in individual converts, in
strong and liberal churches, and an indigenous
native ministry. The Gospel has also leavened
the population generally, and introduced many
remarkable innovations among the hard and
cruel customs of former days. The Brahmins
have fought hard for their supremacy, but it
is steadily passing away. 'Sir,' said a Sudra
one day to a Brahmin, 'have you directed your
attention to a wonder of the present age?
Listen: the Brahmin has become a dealer in oil
and fish, while the Sh&#257;nar or pariah goes
about as a Brahmin or teacher of the country.
The Brahmin woman spends her day in cooking,
eating, and sleeping; while the Sh&#257;nar or
pariah women are found in the streets with
their Scriptures in their hands, pretending to
teach their neighbours. Is not this a wonder?
Verily the world is turning upside down.'</p>

<p>Mr. Gogerly, the well-known missionary of
the London Missionary Society, has given a
graphic and most pleasant account of the early
leaders of the missionary enterprise in Bengal
and of their work. Mr. Grogerly quitted the
mission of which he was a member thirty years
ago, and might long ere this have presented to
the world the striking facts with which he became
acquainted in the course of his Indian
career. But he has reserved the story till the
present day, when some of those facts have
been gradually forgotten, and when the younger
members of our missionary societies hear only
of the modern aspects of Christian work, and of
the larger fruit of conquered difficulties and
converts gathered into the Church of Christ.</p>

<p>Mr. Gogerly's notices of the pioneers in the
Church&mdash;Baptist, Free Church, and American
Missions in North India&mdash;are brief, but some
of them convey original information drawn
from his own experience. He naturally gives
fuller details of the mission to which he himself
belonged, and in which many remarkable
events occurred worthy of a permanent place
in our missionary histories. Later residents in
Bengal will read with wonder of a state of
things in regard to the manners of the people,
their views of idolatry, the honour rendered to
devotees, and the satisfaction felt with the ancestral
religion, which has long since yielded to
the knowledge and light which for forty years
have been changing the Bengal race, and making
them a new people. The numerous anecdotes
given by the writer illustrative of former
days, of domestic habits, of village education,
of native amusements, and of ancient customs,
are extremely interesting. Some institutions
referred to, like suttee, have disappeared. In
regard to others, such as female education, the
position of things has wholly changed.</p>

<p>Mr. Gogerly's book is well illustrated with
numerous engravings, and we heartily commend
it to our readers.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation
to Sex.</i> By <i>Charles Darwin</i>, M.A., F.R.S.
John Murray.</p>

<p>The pleasure of reading Mr. Darwin's long-promised
volumes, which has been keenly anticipated,
is at length gratified. Both the subject
and the man exercise a strange fascination upon
the public mind. As an experienced naturalist,
a speculative philosopher, and a keen logician,
Mr. Darwin would command the attention of
men of science under any circumstances, but
he has the secret of personal power and popularity
quite apart from the accomplishments
which allow him to be classed with other naturalists
and philosophers. It is not the lucid
clearness of his style, nor his power of collecting,
selecting, and grouping facts, nor the
shrewdness and breadth of his generalizations,
alone, which give his readers their exquisite
sense of delight as they follow him through his
descriptions, his arguments, and his speculations.
Beyond all this, he has that sensuous
delight in the real, the beautiful, and the truthful&mdash;that
appreciation of the grandeur of universal
law, visible in the minutest details, and
that union of the receptive and active faculties
which constitute the artist and the genius who
owes more to Nature than to culture. If an
argument may be derived from what man is,
and from the mental excellence which he is
capable of exhibiting, to rebuff the theory that
he is of so humble a parentage as Mr. Darwin
represents, the author himself would be a refutation
of his own theory. In contemplation of
his own powers he might say with Hamlet,
'What a piece of work is man! How noble in
reason, how infinite in faculty! In form and
moving, how express and admirable! In action,
how like an angel! In apprehension, how
like a god! The beauty of the world, the paragon
of animals! and yet, what to me is this
quintessence of dust!' The lineal descendant
proximately of 'a hairy quadruped, furnished
with a tail and pointed ears, probably arboreal
in its habits and an inhabitant of the old
world; remotely, of an animal more like the
larv&aelig; of existing ascidians (lining sacks), than
any other known form!'</p>

<p>Mr. Darwin's volumes treat of two subjects of
profound but not of equal interest. The difference
in the interest felt in <i>man's descent</i> and
in <i>sexual selection</i> is well shown in the numerous
reviews and notices of this work which
have already appeared. More than two-thirds
of the work is devoted to sexual selection, and
this subject is treated, not exhaustively, it is
true, for that is quite impossible in the present
state of our knowledge, but methodically and
comprehensively. A vast number of fresh
facts are presented; a great array of old ones
are marshalled in due order; the phenomena
are traced as they appear throughout the whole
animal kingdom, and historians and travellers
are adduced in evidence to elucidate problems
physical and metaphysical. Yet reviewers
have not taken notice of this, which is really
the most valuable part of the work; guided by
a popular instinct they revert to the subject of
man's descent. They do this although there is
not nearly so much freshness, either in the
facts or arguments presented in this portion of
his work. 'The proper study of mankind is
man,' is a dictum which men who are no students
will readily adopt, because the subject is
not far to seek. That man, the orang, and the
gorilla, have a common ancestor is so fascinating
an idea that none can resist its weird influence.
The clergy repeat it from their pulpits
in scornful utterance, as though the simple
statement carried its own refutation. Transcendental
philosophers like Vogt assume it as a
demonstrated fact. Wits joke about it. The
ears of ladies blush, not at the praise of their
own loveliness, but because of the pointed and
telltale evidence these bear of their own origin.
The fascination of this idea was evident from
the first appearance of 'The Origin of Species.'
The public insisted on seeing in it nothing but
evidence that man had sprung from a lower
form. Yet in that work it was evident that
Mr. Darwin purposely avoided the discussion
of this point. No one will be surprised to
learn, from the introduction of the present
work, that during many years the author had
collected notes on the origin and descent of
man without any intention of publishing on the
subject&mdash;but rather with the determination not
to publish&mdash;that he might not add to the prejudice
against his views. Yet the multitudes
who talk about the book they have never read,
as if they had done so, have all along supposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
and assumed that the one question thus designedly
avoided was the subject of the whole
treatise. No doubt most of the arguments in
favour of the derivation and origin of species,
told with equal force as proofs of the like
derivation and origin of man, but there was yet
room for a supplemental theory, founded on
the vast elevation of man's moral and mental
capacity, which would make man an exceptional
species with an exceptional origin. That
such a view was possible, may be inferred from
the concluding chapter in Mr. Wallace's book
on the same subject, in which a peculiar Providence
is made to preside over the evolution of
man. There can, however, be no mistake now
about Mr. Darwin's view of the question. His
assertions about the origin of man from a lower
form are not only confident, but he has become
dogmatic upon the subject. The attitude of
dogmatism is new to him, and we must say
does not become him so well as the cautious
candour of his earlier work. Mr. Darwin
writes:&mdash;'The main conclusion arrived at in
this work, and now held by many naturalists
who are competent to form a sound judgment,
is that man is descended from some less highly-organized
form. The ground upon which this
conclusion rests <i>will never be shaken</i>....
It is incredible that all these facts should speak
falsely. He who is not content to look, like a
savage, at the phenomena of Nature as disconnected,
cannot any longer believe that man is
the work of a separate act of creation.'</p>

<p>In his speculations as to the genealogical
descent of man and the way in which it emerges
from the ancestral tree of the animal creation,
Mr. Darwin is almost wholly guided by the
rudimentary organs found in man. Mr. Darwin
is quite consistent in this method. No doubt
rudimentary organs which are functionless in
our species and have dwindled almost to nothing,
but are developed and have a palpable
use in other allied forms, present the greatest
difficulties to those who do not believe in a derivative
origin of species, and also afford the
strongest support to the <i>selection</i> theory.
After enumerating the aborted organs, the
transient and f&oelig;tal structures, and the often-recurring
abnormalities found in man, which
are some seventeen or eighteen in number, the
author works out his theory of origin almost
strictly in accordance with the plan of associating
the ancestors of man proximately with
those species which possess the most of these
analogous structures, and so on to the larger
divisions in which a fewer number of them
have a wider distribution. This plan is, no
doubt, philosophical, but it leads the author
into some strange speculations. By similar
reasoning it is demonstrable that our ancestors
were hermaphrodite, and thus long after they
had ceased to be so both sexes yielded milk to
nourish their young, and perhaps carried them
in marsupial sacks.</p>

<p>A doctrine thus dogmatically stated, of
course involves problems and theories hard to
solve and demonstrate, but this arises, in the
opinion of the author, from the fact that the
solutions and demonstrations are hard to find,
and not from the doctrines which involve them
being in the least doubtful. The existence of
the moral sense in man is one of these problems,
and one of the most interesting chapters
in this portion of the work is devoted to
an explanation of the evolution of human conscience.
The moral sense is traced to those
social instincts which man has in common
with all gregarious animals. The strengthening
and growth of the memory and judgment
would enable man to compare his past
actions, and the mere abiding satisfaction of
the process would create that distinction
between the higher and lower law or motive
which is all that modern moralists require.
'Ultimately a highly complex sentiment having
its first origin in the social instincts, largely
guided by the approbation of our fellow-men,
ruled by reason, self-interest, and in the latter
times by deep religious feeling, confirmed by
instruction and habit, all combined, constitute
our moral sense in conscience.'</p>

<p>The second portion of the work is a valuable
contribution to science. It is far more philosophical
in its tone. It is a repertory of facts.
The theories to which these facts point are indeed
discussed, but the method is inductive,
while the method of the first portion appears to
us to be deductive. Beauty as distinguished
from use has always been a stumbling-block to
the disciples of the natural selection school.
That which, in any species, pleases our minds by
immediate agency of the senses, as distinguished
from that which is of service to that species
in adapting it to external conditions, is quite
unaccounted for by the survival of the fittest,
at least so far as wild and untamed species are
concerned. Some evolutionists would cut the
knot by denying the evidence of beauty apart
from fitness. Suitability, symmetry, conspicuousness,
and an imposing appearance are,
no doubt, desiderata which natural selection
may seize upon and secure, and these may incidentally
and necessarily involve that which is
beautiful in our eyes. But after all these have
been eliminated or satisfied, there yet remains
in a large number of species an element of
beauty the contemplation of which brings
pleasure to all human beings, whether educated
or uneducated, refined or unrefined. This is
especially the case throughout those large,
numerously represented and dominant classes
taken from two separate sub-kingdoms and
called insects and birds. These two classes
occupy a great deal of the attention of Mr.
Darwin. If we assume any evolutionary theory,
and abjure the doctrine of final causes, all the
varied beauty of butterflies and humming-birds
has but one probable explanation, namely,
that of sexual selection. To make even this
explanation possible, we must assume a keen,
discriminating &aelig;sthetic faculty in animals which
is like in quality with our own, as that faculty
is possessed by the most refined of our species.
Moreover, this faculty must be intimately connected
with the sexual appetency in each
species. Such a connection is, judging from
analogy, not improbable. In forming an opinion
how far these views are correct, it is important
to isolate the operation of sexual selection
from that of natural selection. Nature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
has throughout almost the whole animal
kingdom afforded to us the means of isolation.
For, as a general rule, the sexes in
species are not absolutely alike, and often there
is great difference between them. All sexual
peculiarities therefore which cannot be explained
on the principle of division of labour, throw
light upon the &aelig;sthetic faculty of animals as a
selective, and therefore by the theory of a creative
agency. Mr. Darwin has collected a vast
mass of facts about sexual peculiarities, which
being in no way connected with the sexual
function, he calls <i>secondary sexual characters</i>.
Of course, sexual secondary characters so limited
point to a difference in the modification of
the sexual desire by &aelig;sthetic appetite in the
two sexes. Generally speaking, the adorned sex
is the male. Have, then, the females a greater
appreciation of beauty than their males? Mr.
Darwin thinks the ardour of the male destroys
his discrimination. Some facts produced, however,
seem to run directly counter to this supposition.
On all hands the peacock is considered
the most splendid of birds, and the difference
between the sexes in this species is
carried to an extreme point. Yet, one of Mr.
Darwin's best authenticated facts is, that the
pea-hen differs from most birds in being the
ardent wooer.</p>

<p>One of the happiest and most satisfactory
episodes in the book is the account of the genesis
of the eye-spot in the plumage of birds, and
specially of that of the ball and socket ornament
in the secondary wing-feathers of the Argus
pheasant. The treatment of this subject
reminds us, by its clearness and beauty, of the
author's treatises on coral islands and the fertilization
of orchids. How simple a phenomenon
may disclose a world of interest and wonder
when in the hands of a man of genius! It
seems to us, however, that that wonderfully
faithful representation of a round ball lying in
a hollow socket, expressed on the flat of the
web of a feather, offers a striking example of
the inadequacy of either natural or sexual
selections to explain such phenomena. 'That
these ornaments,' says Mr. Darwin, 'should
have been formed through the selection of many
successive generations, not one of which was
originally intended to produce the ball and
socket effect, seems as incredible as that one
of Raphael's Madonnas should have been formed
by the selection of chance daubs of paint
made by a long succession of artists, not one
of whom intended to draw the human figure.'
Exactly so! We must attribute to the hen
Argus pheasant the &aelig;sthetic powers of a Raphael
in order to account for the decorations of
her mate, or, more properly, we must assign to
a succession of multitudes of generations of
birds a correctness of appreciation of the
draughtsman's art, such as is a rare excellence
among men. This may be a fact, but if so, it
opens up a new realm to our imagination. It
must be admitted that the tendency of modern
thought is to obliterate the fast line drawn by
old authors between reason and instinct, and to
assign the former less exclusively to man, and
the latter less exclusively to animals. This
tendency and the incidental light thrown by
these considerations on these interesting questions
are well exemplified in Mr. Darwin's
work.</p>

<p>A curious disagreement in opinion between
Messrs. Darwin and Wallace is brought out and
treated of lengthily in the chapters on birds.
Mr. Wallace thinks that in the case of splendid
cock-birds who have plain hens, who sit on
open nests, the tendency for both sexes to become
brilliant has been checked by natural
selection. On the other hand, Mr. Darwin
thinks that secondary sexual splendour was
from the first developed only in the male; and
in the converse case, where the female is also
gay, natural selection causes her to build a
covered nest for protection. We think Mr.
Darwin has the best of the argument. The
question of whether the standard of beauty
among men is uniform in its essentials or not
is ably discussed, but no conclusion is arrived
at; so contradictory is the evidence of travellers
and observers.</p>

<p>We heartily endorse Mr. Darwin's dictum
that false facts are highly injurious to the progress
of science; but false views, if supported
by some evidence, do little harm. We are
therefore content to</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>Thoughts on Health and some of its Conditions.</i>
By <span class="smcap">James Hinton</span>. Smith, Elder,
and Co.</p>

<p>This volume contains by no means a dry
discussion of the conditions of health. It
hardly professes to be methodical or exhaustive
in its treatment of the subject. It is
rather the production of a man who is full of
original ideas such as lie around the subject
of health and life, and who has adopted this
title in order to give them to the public. The
details of the subject have evidently no charms
for the author; nevertheless, those which are
given or referred to show him to be quite
abreast of the foremost file of the army of
science. He is quite poetical in his similes,
and is fascinated by sublime ideas, yet his
chapter on 'Nursing as a Profession' shows
him to be a practical reformer. The book will
be read with interest by those whose mental
bias leads them in that direction, while it gives
vivid conceptions of abstruse ideas. The one
fault of the book is, that the author allows his
imagination to build up speculations upon a
basis of known facts, which fresh facts yet
unknown may very possibly show to be mere
speculations. Thus the speculations about the
functions of nitrogen, carbon, and phosphorus,
when forming complex compounds in the organism
derived and built up upon our knowledge
of their properties as elements, are
doubtless interesting, but they are not backed
by chemical knowledge, and are opposed to
the analogies of that science. This fault, however,
is so allied to the virtues of freshness
and force of thought which are everywhere
found in the volume, that it ought not to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
prejudice the reader against the author,
though he certainly ought to be on his guard
against the seduction of that author's enthusiasm.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>The American Colleges and the American
Public.</i> By <span class="smcap">Noah Porter</span>, D.D., Professor
in Yale College. New Haven, Conn.
1870.</p>

<p>This volume would be invaluable to us if
we had a system of high-school and university
education at all corresponding to that of the
United States. No one is more competent
than Dr. Noah Porter to describe the operation
of the American system, to detect some
of its weaknesses, to contrast it with English
and German tuition, and to point out where
America might learn something from England,
and in what respect England might be benefited
by following transatlantic customs. Far
away from the circumstances and experimental
innovations which have excited so much
general interest in America, we can hardly
enter into any minute criticism of the old customs
or the recent changes. Some of the discussions&mdash;such,
for instance, as that on the
relative advantage of college lectures and text-book-recitations,
on the system of private
tutoring, on the propriety or otherwise of very
frequent examinations, on the dormitory
system, on the advantage of the resident and
non-resident systems, and on the extent to
which laws and supervision on the part of the
college authorities should extend&mdash;will interest
the supporters and professors of English colleges
for the ministry, though many of the
conditions under which we should have to
apply them are so profoundly different that
not much light would be attained for our
guidance. The calm, candid, lucid manner in
which our author has investigated the whole
subject, and held the balances in all these discussions,
is worthy of all respect. In advocating
greater freedom from clerical influence,
and more breadth in the relations between the
authorities and the graduates in the government
of the colleges, we presume that he is
treading on delicate ground. In our smaller
institutions we have long since adopted the
principle he recommends. Our national universities
will become before long the property
of the nation, and not of a sect, and be governed
in deference to law, by their own <i>alumni</i>,
without any privilege but that which is earned
by distinguished ability. This, however, is
not the place to discuss a question like
this.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>The Ancient Geography of India; the Buddhist
Period, including the Campaigns
of Alexander and the Travels of Hwen-Thsang.</i>
By <span class="smcap">Alexander Cunningham</span>,
Major-General, Royal Engineers (Bengal,
retired). With thirteen Maps. Tr&uuml;bner
and Co. 1871.</p>

<p>The author of 'The Bhilsa Topes' has once
more brought his great learning, and his rare
advantages of travel and of residence to bear
on the elucidation of the Buddhist period of
Indian history and thought. On this occasion
he has, however, shown his antiquarian, topographical,
and etymological skill in deciphering
and harmonizing the geography of the Greek
historians and the Chinese pilgrims. Few
things are more important to the comprehension
of any history&mdash;sacred, classic, modern,
or contemporary&mdash;than a clear exhibition of
the physical features of the country on which
the destinies of generations have been determined,
and a sound identification of the sites
of famous cities, fortresses, temples, and
battle-fields. When the history of great
nations covers thousands of years, the physical
features may be recovered by personal
inspection of sites that are distinctly described
by early writers; but the confusing resemblance
of neglected and buried cities to each
other has been the fruitful source of false
identifications, and when once on a wrong
scent, the geography of large districts of country
has often been thrown into hopeless entanglement.
The geography of India, with its
history, maybe conveniently divided into three
periods. The Vedic or Brahmanic period
would cover the entire prehistoric section of
the history, and trace the extension of the
Aryan race from their first occupation of
the Punjab to the rise of Buddhism. The
Buddhist period would extend from the era
of Buddha&mdash;whensoever that may be determined,
say between the fourth and sixth century
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>&mdash;to Mahmoud of Ghizni; and the
Mohammedan period will extend from the rise
of the Mohammedan power to the battle of
Plassy. Major-General Cunningham has devoted
a volume of nearly six hundred pages to
the investigation of the geography of India
during the Buddhist period, which may be
said to cover from fourteen to sixteen hundred
years. He has personally travelled over the
entire country, and carefully scanned its features
with a curious, arch&aelig;ological eye, and
has thus succeeded in fixing the line of Alexander's
campaigns, and in bringing into geographical
completeness and unity the itineraries
and allusions of the Chinese pilgrims,
Fah-pian, Chung-yun, and Hwen-Thsang.
Though the campaigns of Alexander were confined
to the valley of the Indus and its tributaries,
yet the information collected by his
companions, and the records of subsequent
embassies between the Seleucid&aelig; and the
Maurya and other princes, include abundant
references to the whole valley of the Ganges.
We think we may confidently assert that no
student of the works of R&eacute;musat and Lassen,
Stanislas Julien, or Vivien de St. Martin, will
now be content without having General Cunningham's
maps and expositions at his side. It
would be difficult to do justice to such a work in
a brief notice; still, some of the identifications
are of general interest. The merest tyro in
Buddhist lore knows something of the legend
of Kun&acirc;la, the beautiful-eyed son of Asoka,
the great Buddhist king, who was sent in his
youth and unsuspecting innocence to quell a
revolt in the great city of <i>Taxasila</i>, and who
there suffered the loss of his lustrous eyes in
consequence of the malicious designs of his
stepmother. Everyone has heard that in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
neighbourhood of this city, Buddha is fabled
in a previous state of existence to have made
the sacrifice of his head in alms, and to have
offered himself in another existence to a dying
tigress, having first fed her with his blood that
she might be strong enough to devour him
more effectually. The city was admired by
Alexander himself; it was described by Pliny
and Arrian; it was visited by Apollonius of
Tyana, and referred to by his celebrated biographer,
Philostratus. It was visited with
enthusiasm by Fah-Hian 400 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, and by
Hwen-Thsang in 630 and 643 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>; and a
variety of particulars are mentioned which have
enabled our author by personal inspection to
identify the exact spot, to make out the ruins,
the lines of walls and roads, and the site of
the stupa placed by the great King Asoka over
the scene of the act of self-sacrifice to which
we have referred.</p>

<p>Our author identifies the celebrated city
<i>Sr&acirc;vasti</i> with the ruined city of <i>S&acirc;het-M&acirc;het</i>,
where he discovered a colossal figure of
Buddha, with an inscription having on it the
name of this city, immortalized by Buddha's
most successful preaching. He has shown
that when Hwen-Thsang visited Sr&acirc;vasti it
must have been in utter decay, and that he
mistook the ruins of the city for those of the
palace; but Cunningham has brought the
divergent statements of the Chinese pilgrims
as to the distance of <i>Sr&acirc;vasti</i> from other points
into sufficient accord to be satisfactory, and he
draws by a clever etymological man&oelig;uvre the
modern name <i>S&acirc;het-M&acirc;het</i> into harmony with
the Pali form <i>S&acirc;watthi</i> and the Chinese name
She-wei. We have, moreover, in the volume
strong reasons given for fixing the site of
Kapilavastu, the birthplace of Buddha, at
<i>Nagar</i>, in the northern division of Oude; and
the site of <i>Nalanda</i>, the monster Buddhist
monastery, at <i>Baragaon</i> near Gaza; and so
with hundreds of other places which are interesting
from their mention in Buddhist
legend or authentic Buddhist biography. We
heartily thank General Cunningham for his
elaborate work.</p>

<p>This is only a guide-book, but it is one of a

Fully informed with the spirit of the

a topographical companion. The poetry and
sentiment and delicate observation of various
writers, bred of cultured gazing upon the
ruins which almost make twenty centuries
synchronous, have been carefully gathered
together; but the requirements of the mere
sightseer have not been forgotten. The volumes

<p>Two things are evident on the most cursory
inspection of Mr. Elwin's work; first, that he
has spared no pains in probing every corner
of a most complicated story; secondly, that
he finds a pleasure in making the case against
Pope look as black as it possibly can be made.
In a long and minute investigation of the circumstances
attending the publication of the
successive volumes of Pope's letters, he exposes
the petty trickery and vanity of the
poet. We are ashamed of Pope as we read
this merciless exposure. But we are somewhat
relieved when we recollect that after all
these frauds and concealments there was
nothing to gain by it. Like the magpie hiding
a silver spoon, Pope took nothing by his
trickery but the pleasure of deceiving. He
could not help doing as he did. Whether
from his Catholic education, or from whatever
cause, he had contracted a dishonest habit of
mind, which came out in all his dealings. But
Mr. Elwin gets so heated with the chase after
Pope's stratagems, that he discovers them
even where they do not exist. When he sets
up the theory that the 'Essay on Man' was
a treatise of infidelity palmed off on the
public under the disguise of a vindication of optimism,
he overshoots the mark.</p>

<p>So far three volumes of the edition are
before us&mdash;two of the poems, and one of the
correspondence. We hope in some early number

Mr. Elwin's editorial work.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>Napoleon Fallen.</i> A Lyrical Drama. By
<span class="smcap">Robert Buchanan</span>. Strahan and Co.</p>

<p>Mr. Buchanan is a brilliant <i>improvisatore</i>,
and could doubtless produce dramas and epics
to order on any subject to which the revolutionary
mind is akin. We do not doubt the
genuineness of his lyrical passion; it is white-hot
and screaming, but it seems as if it were
easy to kindle, not quite rational in its foundation,
and certainly not classical in its expression.
As a rhymed pamphlet, special-pleading
a cause, and echoing the cries of the hour,
'Napoleon Fallen' is unquestionably powerful;
as a dramatic representation of events in
the shape in which they will descend to history,
it is too violent to be true. It was a
happy device to incorporate the Athenian
chorus with the modern drama; the expedient
provided expression for the eager feelings with
which the world witnessed the stupendous
struggle. But to import into the statuesque
forms of poetry the frantic passion and inarticulate
rage of the vanquished, in their naked
amorphous violence, removes the poem out of
the sphere of art. If the representation of a
thing is meant to be permanent, the thing
itself must be not only real, but also permanent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
in its nature. Lessing laid down
this canon, and one would have thought that it
was now established. But if 'Napoleon Fallen'
is not perfect as a poem, there is very much
fine poetry in it. The lyrical fire which an
age in travail with revolutions produces is perhaps
not rare in our days; Mr. Buchanan unquestionably
possesses it. He also possesses
that belief and faith without which no man has
a right to sing at all&mdash;belief in the divine end
of human life, and faith in the future. With
poetic indefiniteness it is rather an aspiration
than an articulated creed, but he is at least no
emasculated Pagan. His dramatic power is
less obvious, and perhaps it is only the dramatism
of the lyrist&mdash;the mere modulation of passion
into a different key.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>King Arthur.</i> By <span class="smcap">Edward Bulwer</span> (Lord
Lytton.) Tucker.</p>

<p>Lord Lytton's variety and pertinacity of
effort must command the admiration of even
those who do not deem him great. Amongst
those churlish critics we fear we must be ranked.
He is not <i>quite</i> a poet, yet we cannot help
sympathizing with his firm resolve to place
himself among poets if the thing could be done
by endeavour. In that way it cannot be done.
Marsyas shall never equal Apollo. Lord Lytton's
place among novelists is not at this juncture
our affair; his place among versifiers is
high, as 'St. Stephen's' shows; but we can
give him no place among poets. His 'King
Arthur,' which has now been some years before
the public, is a complete proof of this.
Even Mr. Tennyson himself has not made quite
the best of the son of Uther Pendragon. We
prefer the old version of 1460&mdash;</p>

misconception of the wondrously beautiful
story of Vivian. We cannot comprehend why
nobody dare tell us how Launcelot of the Lake
killed Agrawayne. If these old myths deserve
poetic treatment, treat them fairly; it is absurd
to modify them to suit the indelicate delicacy
of a modern society whose most refined journals
are fond of essays upon questionable
topics. This, however, is a slight digression:
let us return to Lord Lytton. He has managed
to transform the Arthurean romance into
melodrama. Gawine and his raven remind one
of a burlesque by Burnand or Byron. Indeed,
the poem shows poverty of invention, and a
complete want of mastery over rhythm and
rhyme and style. Here is a hexastichon:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Pomp of cloud'&mdash;'reflects its lustre'&mdash;'worthy
centre'&mdash;'odorous canopy'; these are
just the phrases that nobody would write who
took the trouble to think. And why in the
world should poor King Arthur be compared
to the moon? He has been much misrepresented
by many poets; he was a semi-barbarous
Welshman, whom our Somersetshire men
drove into the sea down by Tintagel: but he
has had a <i>sacer vates</i>, and we do not see why
he should be subjected to inferior treatment.
Is there anything in the contemporary Arthurean
verse that approaches Sir Ector's lament
over Sir Launcelot of the Lake&mdash;Achilles of
the Arthurean <i>Iliad</i>?... 'Ah Sir Launcelot,
thou wert head of all Christian Knights....
And thou wert the courteousest knight that
ever bore shield. And thou wert the truest
friend to thy lover of a sinful man that ever
loved woman. And thou wert the kindest man
that ever struck with sword. And thou wert
the goodliest person that ever came among press
of knights. And thou wert the meekest man
and the greatest that ever ate in hall among
ladies. And thou wert the truest knight to thy
mortal foe that ever put spear in rest.' So
says the old poet. Can Lord Lytton or Mr.
Alfred Tennyson approach him? Can Homer
beat him? The illustrations of this edition are
scarcely worthy of the poem.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>The Iliad of Homer.</i> Translated by J. G.
<span class="smcap">Cordery</span>. Rivingtons.</p>

<p>Englishing Homer has of late been a general
occupation with men of letters, and we should
be the last to object to it. We delight in
Homer. We rather dislike the effeminate treatment
which some of his myths have met at the
hands of one or two eminent modern poets.
We hold that there is more in the sonorous
swing of those demiurgic dactyls than the contemporary
writers of blank verse can quite
comprehend. Erratic enough are we to hold
that there was one Homer, not many&mdash;that no
<i>purpurei panni</i> of Peisistratus were interwoven
with his cloth of gold&mdash;that he was an isolated
leader of thought. Certain also are we that
his influence is in these days much needed, and
that his Greek ideas are of great service to
modern Englishmen; his strength and simplicity
are things we possess and admire; many
an Achilles has led the forlorn hope for England,
and many an Odysseus has been a F.R.G.S.
There is nothing more remarkable in
Homer than what we shall venture to call his
<i>Englishness</i>. Hence, from one point of view
the late Earl of Derby translated him well; for
the Earl was an Englishman every inch, and, as
we have heretofore said in these pages, the
Hector of the Tory Troy. But as the Earl was
not a poet, he could not exactly render as he
ought to be rendered the supreme poet of the
pagan past. Lord Derby saw in him the part
which is visible to the English legislator
and landowner. There is a good deal more
than this in Homer scarcely comprehensible
by the race whose motto is <i>sans changer</i>. There
are unfathomable depths of poetic philosophy
in those two oceans of thought which we call
the 'Iliad' and 'Odyssey.' The key-note is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
struck in <span class="greek" title="Dios d' eteleieto boul&ecirc;">&#916;&#953;&#8056;&#962;  &#948;' &#7952;&#964;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#943;&#949;&#964;&#959; &#946;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#942;
</span>: throughout
Homer we find the will of the supreme Divinity
always manifested.</p>

<p>It is, we believe, this coincidence of English
with Hellenic ideas which causes so many men
of different types to find pleasure in Homer.
Think of the chasm between Pope and the
"sick vulture," or even between Lord Derby
and the poet Worsley. The theme is tempting,
but space avails not; we must say a word
or two on Mr. Cordery's 'Iliad.' He seems, so
far as we have followed him, to know his Greek
excellently well; but he assuredly does not
know the power and capacity of English blank
verse. The rhythmic weapon, the most difficult
we know, is not within his power to wield.
Thus he commences the 'Iliad'&mdash;those lines
which, as Lord Macaulay would say, 'every
schoolboy knows'&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'Sing, goddess, of Achilles, Peleus' son</p>
<p>The wrath that rose disastrous, and the cause</p>
<p>Of woes unnumbered to Achaia's host,' &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p>The first few lines suffice. Here is a writer
who cannot wield the metre he has chosen.
This being so, we find it undesirable to enter
farther into any discussion of the merits of his
version, and shall content ourselves with giving
conscientious praise to his loving and patient
attempt to do a great work which is beyond
his height of attainment. This is not contemptuous
nor careless criticism. Not yet has
Homer been done into English. Will any future
translator give us Homer's unutterable
music, Homer's unfathomable thought?</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>Ierne.</i> A Tale. By <span class="smcap">W. Steuart Trench</span>. 2
vols. Longmans, Green, and Co.</p>

<p>If Mr. Trench's 'Realities of Irish Life' was
something more than a history, 'Ierne' is something
more than a romance. It is full of vivid
pictures of Irish life, and is inlaid with historical
information, political disquisitions, and didactic
comment. We are not sure which presents
the truer portraiture, the history or the
romance, probably the latter. It appears, in
spite of the extravagance and impossibility of
its incidents, to reproduce with the fidelity
which long personal familiarity enables, various
aspects of Western Irish life, its fine culture,
enthusiastic genius, and heroic patriotism in the
higher classes; its wild passions, its half-savage
instincts, and its no less noble patriotism in the
lower. The representation is not a very hopeful
one; at least, whatever hope there is in it
must be found in the gross inconsistencies of
thought, and in the unaccountable impulses of
feeling which made Ireland such an enigma to
Lord Killarney; the blind, deep-rooted infatuation
about the ownership of land, and the
notion that all improvements by Saxon possessors
are inimical to its reversion, so that the
better the landlord, the worse the feeling of antagonism
excited, is profoundly perplexing.
Mr. Trench has so thorough a knowledge of
Irish feeling that we must accept this representation
as true. Even the excellencies of a
Saxon landlord, and his solicitude for the improvement
of his estate and for the comfort of
his peasantry, are specific reasons why he
should be shot. Mr. Trench writes in full
sympathy with the people in their sense of
wrong. Few nations have been so oppressed
and peeled, and no generous or even just Englishman
will deny that, however unreasonable
and fanatical Irish treason is now, when for
nearly a century everything that could be done
to redress the tyranny of the past has been
done, it has traditional justification which almost
exalts it to patriotism; and Mr. Trench
feels the difficulty of so adjusting his sympathy
as that while he justifies the national resentment
of the past, he may condemn the continued
treason of the present. Of course he sees no
possibility in the dreams of repealers, and wishes
every wise friend of Ireland would denounce
repeal as the worst thing that could befall her.
He can only, with ourselves, hope that the
measures of redress of the last two Parliaments
which leave Ireland almost literally without a
grievance, will gradually discredit political agitation,
and engender loyalty. He does, indeed,
half suggest that a royal residence in Ireland,
occasional visits from the Queen, or the Prince
of Wales, would, as an appeal to Irish sentiment,
be more potent than even the disestablishment
of the Irish Church, or the enactment of
the Land Bill. If so, it is a pity the experiment
is not tried. As a romance, Mr. Trench's
book is scarcely worthy of criticism. Ierne's
personation of the ghost and her marvellous
movements and achievements generally are
simply preposterous. We tolerate the romance
for the sake of the pictures of Irish life interwoven
with it. Inveterate novel-readers will
get through this, others will skip the tale, but
even then the book will, by its information concerning
national feelings and prejudices, and
its delineation of various scenes of national life,
faction fights, midnight drills, meetings of conspirators,
and wakes, and especially by its
racy delineation of national humour, and its
careful description of noble scenery, amply
repay persual.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>V&eacute;ra</i>. By the Author of 'The H&ocirc;tel au Petit
St. Jean.' Smith, Elder, and Co.</p>

<p>The Charm of 'V&eacute;ra' is twofold; first, it
introduces us to the interior of Russian life,
and excites our interest by the delineation of
modes of thought, feeling, and life, very different
from our own. Next, it is written with
great literary skill; the author's first work,
which delineated Proven&ccedil;al life, will have prepared
its readers for excellent workmanship in
this. It is a story of character rather than of
incident. V&eacute;ra is a Russian Princess, affianced
in marriage to Count Alexis Yotoff, her cousin,
but the contemplated marriage is one of convenience
rather than of affection, and when
Alexis falls at Inkermann, he is wept with
tenderness but not with passion. Colonel St.
John, the nephew and heir of Lord Kendal,
who lies wounded on the field of Inkermann, is
assailed by some Russian stragglers, Alexis interposes
to save him, and accidentally falls a
victim to St. John's pistol, which he is in the
act of discharging. He receives from the dying
Alexis some souvenirs which he engages to convey
to V&eacute;ra and his family. His wounds affect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
his memory, and years elapse without his
being able to redeem his pledge, and recall the
names of either Alexis or his friends. In the
meanwhile he becomes acquainted with V&eacute;ra,
and, although twenty years her senior, they
are mutually in love. Their love, however, is
sadly marred by cross purposes. At length St.
John discovers, under critical circumstances,
that V&eacute;ra was the intended recipient of the
souvenirs, and that his was the hand that deprived
her of her lover. For awhile the discovery
is fatal, but a fortunate railway accident
affords an opportunity for explanation, and all
comes right at last. The artistic excellence of
the work is in its delineations, and the undertone
of thoughtful sentiment, if not philosophy,
that runs through it. Its text is the inevitableness
of destiny; and the way in which the
story illustrates this is as original as it is
clever. It is a very charming novel, one of the
very few which we wish longer.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>Episodes in an Obscure Life.</i> Three vols.
Strahan and Co.</p>

<p>This is one of the few books that leave the
critic no alternative but simply to heap together
words of eulogy. Its least and lowest
merit is its literary workmanship, and yet we
scarcely know where we could look for more
vivid pictures of accurate observation, of chaste
simplicity, and unpretentious power. The large-hearted
geniality, manly piety, and unwearied
benevolence of the anonymous writer inform
his eye and guide his hand, throwing gleams
of radiance, aspects of humour, and visions of
hope over the sad conditions of squalid misery
which he describes, without a particle of
Dickens's falsetto. He exhibits the noble kindly-heartedness
and heroic self-denial that are
often to be found in combination with rough exteriors
and chronic misery. 'Little Creases,'
'Mr. Jones,' 'the Matron of the Refuge,' 'Emily,
the crossing-sweeper,' 'Bessie,' 'Sam and his
wife,' 'Peter and his wife,' 'Blind Stevens and
his wife,' and half a score others, are illustrations
not only of the kindly and often heroic
human nature that there is among the poorest,
but of the benevolent patient optimism in the
writer that sees and exhibits it. It is long
since 'Annals of the Poor' were recorded with
so much genial sympathy and unconscious art.</p>

<p>The conditions of life described in these
sketches are a humiliation and a sorrow. Never
before have the underlying evils and miseries
of our gilded civilization been so vividly portrayed.
Legislators and philanthropists have
a Herculean task before them in the amelioration
of the physical and moral evils of such
districts as the East of London&mdash;the overcrowding,
the adulterated food, the festering disease,
the moral corruption, the extreme penury, the
lawless vice, the wretched ignorance, the impassable
gulfs, not one but many, between the
rich and poor. East-end ministers of religion
know them, ragged-school teachers and City
missionaries know them, few else have any
conception of them. Little do travellers who
arrive at the terminus of the Great Eastern
Railway know that within a stone's throw of
the platform scenes such as are here described
are any day to be witnessed. The good and
the evil both&mdash;the good in spite of evil that is
simply appalling&mdash;conditions of poverty, lawlessness,
vice, and suffering are nowhere in the
wide world to be surpassed. Legislation may
do something to remedy this state of things;
commercial prosperity may do something; but
it is, we fear, chiefly the result of an indolence
and vice that neither can touch. In every village
there are drunken, idle vagabonds; in
great cities this element is fearfully multiplied
and intensified, and it brings misery upon hundreds
who are not of it.</p>

<p>All honour, then, to brave, patient, Christ-like
men like the author of this work, who are
content to live their obscure life, if they may
but do something to alleviate it. Theirs is the
only influence that can regenerate vice, or in
any way effectually deal with it. We know
something of the district which the writer describes,
and happily we can testify to scores of
young men and women of the upper classes
who visit it, and cheerfully give evenings and
Sundays to teach ragged children, instruct
their mothers, and, so far as it is wise, afford
them substantial help. No one can doubt
that a clergyman, gifted as is the author of
this work, has chosen his lot, abjured the ease
and elegance of refined life which might have
been his, that after the example of his Master
he may seek and save the lost. How simply,
sincerely, and wisely, as well as with what unconscious
self-sacrifice, he does it, this noble
book will show. With characteristic self-abnegation
the author does not give his name.
Every reader will heartily say, 'God bless
him;' and if our recommendation could avail
it should carry his book into every rich man's
house and every comfortable home in the land.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>Earl's Dene.</i> By <span class="smcap">R. E. Francillon</span>. In Three
vols. Edinburgh: W. Blackwood and Sons.</p>

<p>'Earl's Dene' has too obviously been written
for the critics to satisfy a critic. The
course of the narrative is interrupted by appeals
<i>ad clerum</i>, which disturb the sense of
illusion without convincing the judgment.
The tone of the book is apologetic and explanatory,
as if the author were under terror of
the critic's lash, and were conscious that the
movement of the story would seem so capricious
as to require justification. This is a mistake
in art, which seldom carries any compensation
with it. The ordinary novel-reader is
the most unexacting of human beings, and has
unlimited capacity of digesting improbabilities;
while the cultivated and analytic reader will be
too conscious of the complexity of motives to
be scared by superficial inconsistencies in the
delineation of character. Thackeray was guilty
of frequent 'asides,' but they were only outbreaks
of cynicism or of pathos; incessant
eruptions of psychology are less pleasing, if
not more inartistic. But in all respects, this
very defect included, 'Earl's Dene' is far above
the level of common-place fiction. Though
not strikingly original, it is evidently a transcription
of life at first hand, and as seen
through the medium of a refined and delicate
intellect. The atmosphere of the book, though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
now and again disturbed by storms, is pure
rather than bracing, and is fragrant with the
aroma of refined reflection, which must be the
outcome of long and intense experience. Decidedly
feminine, we should say; overflowing
with observations on the sex that look like self-revelations,
and with sketches of the male
animal which are inexpressibly grotesque when
they are not weak. If anyone wants to see
how Bohemia and its denizens picture themselves
in an alien mind, he should study the
portrait of Dick Barton, a cross between Caliban
and Porson, an absurd and utterly impossible
monster. But the characters are for the
most part carefully drawn, by slight repeated
touches, however, rather than by bold and
luminous strokes. The dialogue sparkles with
French <i>esprit</i>. There is obvious shrinking
from common-place, as when the author refuses
to describe first love; and, lastly, the novel is
a novel with a purpose. It shows to men the
ways of that great god 'Circumstance,' who
seems a very Moloch, and winds up the tragedy
by a general holocaust of his victims.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>My Little Lady.</i> Hurst and Blackett.</p>

<p>This charming novel, evidently by a female
hand, is written with much grace and variety.
The idea on which it is based has the advantage
of perfect novelty. The 'little lady' is
the child of an inveterate aristocratic gambler
called Linders, who lives at Spa and Baden
and other places of the same class, and who
has a marvellous capacity for 'breaking the
bank.' Whether he has a 'Martingale' we are
not told, and indeed the authoress occasionally
shows that she is quite properly unfamiliar
with <i>rouge et noir</i> and <i>roulette</i>. But the
conception is that this fellow, though on the
whole a scoundrel, loves his little daughter
Madelon, and that she, following him everywhere,
becomes acquainted with the games he
plays, and innocently regards gaming as quite
a proper mode of making money. The complications
herefrom arising are manifold, and are
told felicitously: but the writer, who is probably
a beginner, is apt to spin out her description
and narrative to a rather wearisome
length. Rapidity of narration is becoming
one of the rarest qualities of modern authorship.
That authors are paid for quantity instead
of quality sufficiently accounts for this:
and the great novel-manufacturers of the day,
who turn out a volume a month and find
readers for them, must, we suppose, be tolerated:
but we cannot help regretting this unsatisfactory
prolixity when, as in the present
case, there is a pretty and piquant and original
story to be told. However, it will be
largely read, since it is high above the average
of tales of the same order. Of the characters,
the best drawn is the great gambler himself;
hardly a possible personage, we suspect, but if
possible curiously interesting. Madelon in her
utter simplicity is very lovely; and she is quite
conceivable, since there is no reason why a
young girl should see any harm in gambling.
Nine people out of ten would be puzzled to
say on the instant why gambling is wrong:
and the state of society shows that very
'honourable men' (as Mark Antony hath it)
can see no harm in the doings at Tattersall's
and the Victoria Club. So that a little girl
whose father was an astute patrician gambler,
should innocently take to <i>rouge et noir</i>, is
quite intelligible&mdash;and a very pretty story is
based upon it, with some strongly dramatic
scenes therein. By the way, the names of
flowers should be properly spelt, especially by
lady writers: Westeria (vol. ii. p. 185) ought
to be Wistaria, as it was named after Caspar
Wistar, professor of anatomy in the University
of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>Harold Erle.</i> By the Author of "The Story
of a Life."</p>

<p>The author of this poem reveals his high
and delicate culture, and not unfrequently a
true poetic grace. There are lines, passages,
and entire scenes, which suggest the blank
verse of Wordsworth. We are not reminded
of the introspection and subjective might by
which Wordsworth brings under the microscope
of his 'inward eye' the beauties of
nature and the mysteries of life, but of his
bald simplicity, of his religious use of common-place,
as well as of his partial inability to appreciate
the difficulty which the great majority of
the human race experience in perceiving a
poetic side of 'common things.' 'Harold
Erle' is a singularly painful theme, and one
which will not readily lend itself to the Muses.
The dangers incident to the marriage of blood
relations, and the Nemesis which hereditary
insanity imposes on some who enter into the
lists of love, are not refreshing matters for contemplation.
Blighted affections, the madhouse,
and the grave, certainly provide material for
high imaginative treatment, but when these
strong colours are used chiefly with a view of
entrapping us into a philosophic generalization
of a universal law of marriage, we are disposed
to feel that poetry itself has here degenerated
into social philosophy. 'Harold Erle'
is a powerful story, but the moral and the
motive of it seem insufficient, and the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>
is decidedly prosaic. The <i>l'envoie</i> of the
poem seems to be: 'Young people, do not
marry your first cousins; should your parents
have been so foolish as to have done this, then,
by all the nine Muses, do not marry at all.'</p>

<p>The career of Harold Erle is well told. Certain
scenes are portrayed with pictorial power.
There are tender touches of consummate
grace, and emotions, events, and sacrifices are
narrated which show how fertile this unwelcome
theme has become in the hand of an
accomplished writer.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>Martha.</i> By <span class="smcap">William Gilbert</span>, Author of
'Lucrezia Borgia,' &amp;c. Hurst and Blackett.
1871.</p>

<p>In the conduct of this story Mr. Gilbert has
not stinted his readers in the matter of time.
We are furnished with the family history and
domestic details of four, if not five, successive
generations. Near the commencement of the
story we are introduced to a wealthy young
spendthrift, who is startled by losses on the
turf into propriety, thrift, and marriage. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
closing pages of the novel bring us acquainted
with the great-grandchildren of this
worthy. An extraordinary number of prosy
and uninteresting characters&mdash;many of them
mere dummies&mdash;try the patience of the reader.
With aggravating minuteness circumstances
which have no bearing on the story are laboriously
detailed. About a dozen different
illnesses or accidents are portrayed at such
length as to suggest the notion that a hospital
clerk had nefariously introduced into the
author's manuscript some pages from his medical
note-book. The oracular twaddle of the
medical adviser who figures throughout the
story is redeemed from common-place only by
the presentation of a rather interesting psychological
problem which, we presume, may be
stated thus: Is it possible on purely physical,
or at least subjective, grounds to account for
the belief entertained by an otherwise rational
person that the phantoms of her departed
relatives continually visited her in the great
crises of a chequered life? We presume that
Mr. Gilbert intends to suggest a strong affirmative.
The subject of these hallucinations,
called Martha Thornburg, is the only character
of the story who possesses the minutest tittle
of interest. She is the impersonation of unselfish
consecration of life to the good of
others, and on two separate occasions in her
long life, at considerable intervals from each
other, she is represented as enduring the very
extremity of human suffering. She becomes
a lightning-conductor of all the accumulated
misfortune with which the devil of the piece
has charged the thunder-cloud that spends its
fury on this ill-fated family.</p>

<p>There are two villains, at least, among the
<i>dramatis person&aelig;</i> so utterly unredeemed by a
single ray of goodness as to despoil them of
all human interest. The one apparently belongs
to the genus rattlesnake, the other to the
genus hy&aelig;na. Bigamy, fraudulent bankruptcy,
forgery, destitution of natural affection, detestable
cowardice, attempted fratricide and
murder, are a few of the peccadilloes of the more
refined devil, who at last dies in his bed; the
other, we are thankful to say, hangs himself.
The vigorous, prosperous, generous brother of
'Martha,' as well as many other characters,
are very faintly sketched, and the principal,
if not the sole, interest of the story consists in
the misguided goodness of 'Martha,' who
covers herself with the suspicion of complicity
with the miscreant who had been throughout
the curse of her family. However, the mystery
is cumbrous in the extreme, and the solution
of it by no means artistic. We certainly
cannot congratulate Mr. Gilbert on a successful
use of his undoubted powers; but we are
glad to know that, after all their vicissitudes,
Martha Thornbury, her brother, his nephew,
and the wife and family of the latter are all
doing well. Their furniture is excellent, their
wardrobe complete, their bracelets, ornaments,
and toys abundant; and we earnestly trust
that should any illness or accident befall them,
Dr. Wilson will be at hand, not only with
skilful treatment, but with ample explanations
of all the pathological phenomena.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>Dorothy Fox.</i> By <span class="smcap">Louisa Parr</span>. Strahan
and Co.</p>

<p>It is vain to pooh-pooh love stories, so
long as the passion itself rules the world so
much as it does; the thing that provokes the
protest of sensible people is, that love stories
are-often so ineffably foolish, as indeed are
people who are in love. A thoroughly good
love story, high-minded, true-hearted, and sensible,
is about as good a service as a novelist
can render to her generation. To inculcate
noble principles, and inspire noble feelings in
the pursuit of the passion upon which the chief
social happiness of the world depends, is a
work worthy of the highest genius, and demanding
the gratitude of all who wish well to
mankind. 'Dorothy Fox' is a love story pure
and simple. Dorothy is the daughter of a
Quaker of the strictest sort, a wealthy hosier,
destined to marry Josiah Crewdson, also a
well-to-do tradesman; but, as even the primmest
and most dutiful Quakeresses will do, she
takes it into her pretty head or heart to fall in
love with Captain Charles Verschoyle, a poor
cadet of a good family, whose mother, Lady
Laura, is bent upon both him and his sister
making good matches. Charles reciprocates
Dorothy's love, and will not marry Miss Bingham's
fifty thousand pounds. While Audrey,
the sister of Charles, instead of marrying as
she ought old Mr. Ford, the millionaire <i>parvenu</i>,
perversely falls in love against her own
intention with Mr. Dynecourt, a poor barrister
of ancient lineage. How Lady Laura schemed,
and old Mr. Fox was scandalized; how wise
and generous old Mr. Ford was, and how noble
Josiah Crewdson&mdash;his disagreeable sisters
notwithstanding&mdash;how charming Patience Fox
was, and Grace, and John Hanbury, and how
beautiful and refined Quaker-life may be, and
often is, the authoress has told very charmingly.
The characters of Charles and Audrey, with
their glaze of worldly selfishness, which melts
away like hoar frost under the heat of pure
love, leaving an innate and uncorrupted nobleness,
are very cleverly delineated; so is Harry
Egerton, the rough old squire, with his kind,
manly heart.</p>

<p>The story is a very pleasant and a very
wholesome one. We trust that Miss Parr will
again present to us pictures of Quaker interiors,
with which she is so well acquainted. In them
her strength lies.</p>

in an article in which a detailed account
of 'On the Eve' was given. We need not,
therefore, do more than refer our readers to
what we then said about this very charming
little story, which paints Russian life from the
interior with the hand not only of skill, but of
genius. Its social freedom surprises us, and
its indications of easy social vices startle us.

<p class="hang p2"><i>Marquis and Merchant.</i> By <span class="smcap">Mortimer Collins</span>.
Three vols. Hurst and Blackett.</p>

<p>Mr. Collins in this new novel has aimed to
portray two of the great social classes that
constitute England, and the two that are, perhaps,
in more active rivalry, if not antagonism,
than any other, and to show that the prejudice
is not chiefly with the higher. The Marquis
of Wraysbury, whose hereditary seat is at
Ashbridge, is a favourable representative of
what we are proud to designate our noble aristocracy.
Wealthy, generous, liberal, frank,
gentlemanly, he is the <i>beau ideal</i> of his class.
His son, Lord Waynflete, the hero of the story,
is the inheritor of his father's virtues, with a
freedom from class conventionalities which is
his own, and which permits him, as quite a
thing of course, to marry a poor governess.</p>

<p>Mr. Mowbray, who buys an estate at Ashbridge
and builds there a splendid mansion
overpowering in magnitude, luxury, and appendages
of garden, conservatory, &amp;c., and which
quite dwarfs the more modest belongings of
Ashbridge Manor, is a Manchester millionaire;
also a favourable representative of his class&mdash;keen,
clever, generous, but with some drawbacks
of class prejudice and obstinacy, which
Mr. Collins paints with an evident gusto. He
is the rival of the Marquis in spite of the
latter; and the story is made up not unpleasantly
of the history of their rivalries, with
the issue thereof. Much of the subsidiary delineation
is very good. The interiors at Ashbridge
Manor, at Mowbray Mansion, at the
Orphan Institute, at Mrs. Gutch's, and at delicious
Wyvern Grange, are cleverly sketched,
in these well-selected contrasts. The subordinate
characters; that clever woman, Miss Pinnock,
great in Johnsonese; the Bohemian
lawyer, Terrell; the learned, gentlemanly recluse,
M&eacute;tivier, full of gipsy and all other
lore; and a dozen others, are also admirably
delineated. The novel is deficient as a work
of art, but only a very clever and accomplished
man could have written it. It is somewhat
Bohemian in itself, and has an unpleasant
vinous flavour&mdash;allusions, characterizations, or
eulogies on wines occurring perpetually, as if
the chief good of man were to have a good
wine-cellar and to be a <i>connoisseur</i> of good
vintages. The book is, moreover, an odd <i>m&eacute;lange</i>
of all conceivable things; one chapter is
devoted to a criticism on Tennyson, another to
a criticism on Dickens; verses <i>apropos</i> of
everything and nothing abound. Mr. Collins
has a marvellous Ingoldsby facility for running
off rhymes, and when prose fails him or wearies
him, he takes to verse. A diagram of a game
of chess, an algebraic equation, and no end of
classical quotations, are kneaded like currants
into the dough of Mr. Collins's cookery. Not
only has he been at a feast of languages, and
stolen the scraps, he has evidently carved the
dishes for himself. The story is, as we have
said, not so well constructed as it might be.
It is not always in good taste; it rumbles and
rollicks along; but it is very clever and very
amusing. It is less melodramatic than Mr.
Collins usually is, and is, we think, the best
book he has written.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>The Green-Eyed Monster.</i> By <span class="smcap">Kay Spen</span>.
Smith, Elder, and Co.</p>

<p>The title of this little book indicates its character.
Hugh Barrington falls in love in a railway
carriage with Adela Gwynne, a blue-eyed Welsh
girl, and marries her. She is of a preposterously
jealous disposition, and perversely interprets
countless little incidents as justifying her jealousy.
The story details the working out of
these feelings and their disastrous issues, and
the ability of the writer is shown in her psychological
knowledge and skill. It is in this point
of view very clever. Of course incidents occur
with preternatural consentaneousness, and people
act and feel in a very infatuated way,
setting common sense at defiance, else how
would novels get written? But Kay Spen has
managed her materials well, and has written
an interesting story with a very wholesome
moral.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>Jasmine Leigh.</i> By C. C. <span class="smcap">Fraser-Tytler</span>.
Strahan and Co.</p>

<p>This is a very dainty little story. It is written
in an autobiographical form, and narrates the
history of a young girl blossoming into womanhood
and love, who is abducted by a rough and
sordid wooer, whom, nevertheless, she learns
to pity, if not to love. It is written with a
delicate touch, and is full of graceful and refined
feeling. If, as we surmise, it is a first
work, it is full of promise.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>Her Own Fault.</i> By Mrs. J. K. <span class="smcap">Spender</span>.
Hurst and Blackett.</p>

<p>Mrs. Spender writes with great care and with
considerable strength. Her story is well constructed,
and the characters are marked by
strong individuality. The story is a stormy
one. Sara, who is a very fine creation, is 'a
beautiful embodied storm.' Indeed, the defect
of Mrs. Spender is, that her strength is not
sufficiently calm. Every character is wrought
up to the agony pitch: Sara, when she has accepted
Rosswith Maxwell&mdash;Bryan on the night
when he learns his rejection&mdash;Lawrence Routh
in his suppressed intensity&mdash;Charley in her
passionate sisterliness&mdash;all are wrought up to
powerful and exaggerated passion. Mrs. Spender
might say with the American young lady
after dinner, 'I guess I've piled it on.' The
story, however, is vigorous and original, although
it is not a very pleasant one. Everybody
is to be pitied. Poor Bryan is left with a
sentence of death recorded against him.</p>

<p class="center p2">JUVENILE LITERATURE.</p>

<p class="p2">Among children's books of the past Christmas
which reached us too late for notice in
our New-Year's Juvenile Section, are two or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
three, altogether too remarkable to be passed
over. 'At the Back of the North Wind'
(Strahan), and 'Ronald Bannerman's Boyhood,'
both by George Macdonald, are two books
almost sufficient by their excellences to mark
an epoch in juvenile literature. Excepting
'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,' no recent
work that we can remember is worthy of being
compared with the former. In no other of his
many books has Mr. Macdonald shown more
strikingly the power and delicacy of his imaginative
genius. The blending of sober history
with the most Puck-like fancies&mdash;the underlying
thoughtfulness of both&mdash;the inlaying of
wise reflections, subtly hinted or delicately
touched&mdash;the blossoming into poetical beauty
of almost every position and teaching&mdash;the
light, graceful hand with which the whole is
carried on&mdash;the deep, spiritual meanings that
transfigure the lightest incidents&mdash;altogether
constitute a fairy tale the like of which we
have rarely seen, and which is as suggestive to
the mature as it is amusing to the juvenile.
We know youngsters in the nursery who, if
they could not literally recite it by heart, would
infallibly detect the alteration of a single sentence.
Mr. Macdonald has attained to that
perfection of excellency which understands the
heart of a child. He has made 'Diamond'
immortal. 'Ronald Bannerman's Boyhood'
(Strahan), is altogether different in conception,
feeling, and style. Mr. Macdonald's affluence
of fancy is, with perhaps an equal exercise of
imagination, subdued to the plain matter-of-fact,
no-nonsense-about-it, autobiography of a
school-boy. The sympathy with boy-nature is
as perfect as in the other volume is the sympathy
with child-nature. The narrative is
bright, generous, and true&mdash;the exact tone of a
noble-hearted boy, who has, however, to speak
of some of the troubles and sorrows of life.
Mr. Macdonald, however, never lacks humour.
His description of Mrs. Mitchell, his father's
sour housekeeper, and of the Dame School to
which Ronald was sent, as well as of Kirsty
and the experiences at the farm, is rich and
racy in a high degree. Kirsty tells some capital
kelpie and other Scotch stories and legends.
It is a beautiful picture of childhood, teaching,
by its impressions and suggestions, all noble
things. 'Chamber Dramas for Children,' by
Mrs. George Macdonald (Strahan), are four
little plays, good as Hannah More's Sacred
Dramas, and amusing as the stories of Cinderella,
and Beauty and the Beast, out of which
two of them are constructed. They are cleverly
done, and will doubtless do duty in many
an acted charade. The 'Tetterby's' is founded
upon Dickens's Haunted Man. The 'Snowdrop'
is new to us. 'The Boy in Grey'
(Strahan), by Henry Kingsley, which appeared
in <i>Good Words for the Young</i>, together with
the above, was thereby subjected to a severe
ordeal. It can ill bear the comparison. Instead
of the translucent fancies of Mr. Macdonald,
it is turgid and confused, and when it
would be a&euml;rial, produces the effect that sculptured
clouds do. Its allusions are often beyond
the range of a boy's knowledge; its
nonsense limps, and its wisdom is ponderous.
We have found it very difficult to understand
Mr. Kingsley's meaning. 'Lilliput Lectures,'
by the author of 'Lilliput Lev&eacute;e' (Strahan), is
again perfect in its way. The lectures are on
all sorts of things&mdash;social and religious, physical
and metaphysical, artistic and commercial.
The writer tells us that he writes for no particular
age, but aims generally at a childlike way
of putting things. Some of the things put are
high and mysterious; but then youth has
wondrous dreams and speculations, and the
happy simplicity of the writer helps youthful
thought to climb. Each lecture winds up with
some verses such as only the author of 'Lilliput
Lev&eacute;e' can write. 'Choice Poetry for
Children' (Religious Tract Society), is a small
selection of religious and moral pieces by modern
writers&mdash;of course, of unequal merit, but
wisely and suitably chosen. 'The Pearl of
Story Books' (Nelson) is a collection for children
of Bible narratives in Bible words. 'Mrs.
Montmorency's Money,' by Emma Jane Worboise
(Clarke), belongs to minor fiction rather
than to juvenile literature. Its moral is that
'the love of money is the root of all evil.' As
is always the case with Miss Worboise, it is
carefully written, and there are clever descriptions
and scenes of pathos in it; but it is overlaid
with moral, and not so successful in its
plot as some of her tales. It is, however,
a wholesome and readable story, and its moral
is as timely as it is unexceptional.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>Brevia, Short Essays, and Aphorisms.</i> By the
Author of 'Friends in Council.' Bell and
Daldy.</p>

<p>Most of the writings of Mr. Helps are Brevia.
His books are made like Armstrong guns, of
welded pieces; and the process would not be
a very violent or destructive one that resolved
them into the shape of these fragments. We
can well imagine them to be not so much chips
as prepared blocks for larger works, which the
architecture did not admit of, and which,
therefore, the author has wrought into independent
art forms. They are brimful of
thoughtfulness and practical wisdom; always
genial, often humorous, they make up a table
book of aphorism and apologue, of colloquia,
and short essay, independently conceived and
gracefully expressed&mdash;which among living writers
it would be difficult to parallel. They remind
us most of Whately; only Mr. Helps is
more terse than he. Sometimes reams of discussion
are gathered into half a page; sometimes
a single sentence contains seeds for
reams of discussion. Mr. Helps has given us
a volume of 'Aids for Reflection,' which is
worthy the study of the most desultory. Most
of these short essays and aphorisms have
appeared in <i>Good Words</i>. We quote one sentence&mdash;'Some
persons, instead of making a
religion of their God, are content to make a
God of their religion.'</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>Fors Clavigera: Letters to the Workmen and
Labourers of Great Britain.</i> By <span class="smcap">John
Ruskin</span>, LL.D. Sold only by G. Allen,
Heathfield Cottage, Keston, Kent.</p>

<p>In these letters Mr. Ruskin seeks to teach the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
workmen and labourers of Great Britain some
political economy which we are commonplace
enough to think fallacious, and some history
which we are not Vikings enough to think
otherwise than mischievous. But we are in
full accord with him in his desire to lighten the
national distress around us, and to exterminate
the yahoos of civilization; and if he can show
us, as he seems to think he can, some sure method
of doing both or either, we will abandon
Mr. Mill, and will take our history from Mr.
Carlyle. In the three letters already published
we have not been able to discover any proposal
leading to action, or, indeed, leading to anything
at all, except weariness and vexation of spirit.
But we are perhaps even now on the verge of
the promised land. Mr. Ruskin has become so
practical of late years that we are inclined to
think he has made a real discovery. But he
seems in no hurry to announce it, and delay is
naturally tantalizing.</p>

<p class="center p2">THEOLOGY AND PHILOLOGY.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>Essays, Theological and Literary.</i> By <span class="smcap">Richard
Holt Hutton</span>, M.A. (Lond.) Two
vols. Strahan and Co.</p>

<p>These volumes are likely to take a high place
in English literature, and to measure and expound
the influence which their author has for
many years exerted on the higher thought of
our generation, through the periodical press.
He has submitted a selection of his more
elaborate essays to final revision, and has
brought them together with much skill and
felicity of arrangement. The two volumes are,
in fact, two separate works of exceeding interest,
the one bearing on the highest forms of
modern literature, and the other on the theological
and philosophical speculations of the last
twenty years. The polish and finish of the
revision have excised the genial humour and
delicate satire which have characterized some
of Mr. Hutton's critical efforts, but they have
not altered the substance or modified the tone
of these remarkable papers. In almost all of
them it is easy to trace the hand of the accomplished
publicist, who has acquired the faculty
of seizing one main characteristic of the poetry
or philosophy, political career, or moral tendency
he is wishful to examine, and having
made himself master of this, is resolved to establish
or illustrate it at his leisure. He decides
on a good working hypothesis to account
for the composition of a great poet, or the
spirit of a remarkable book, and leisurely sits
down to transform his hypothesis into a true
induction. When Mr. Hutton brings Wordsworth,
or George Eliot, or Ernest R&eacute;nan, or
Henry Rogers into his field of view, he seems
to say to himself, 'some explanation is possible
of this congeries of spiritual phenomena,' and
he forthwith attacks the problem with the enthusiasm
of a naturalist, and often with the
penetration of a true philosopher. He exhibits
great insight, and his speculation is always
worthy of attention, but it too much resembles
the bar of sunshine gleaming through an aperture
in a shutter, which throws an intense
light on some portions of a painted chamber
but leaves other portions in hazy and dubious
shadow. We heartily thank him for the vivid
image he has drawn, and for the key he has
often given us to the intellectual treasures of
some of our greatest modern thinkers; but we
do not feel that he has adequately solved all
the problem, or has definitely formulated the
mental life or calibre of either the poets or
theologians whom he passes in review. Thus
almost all that he says of Wordsworth is
nobly and truly said. There is consummate
ability in his reply to Hazlitt's 'thorny praise,'
in his comparison of Wordsworth and Tennyson,
and in his method of proving the thesis
with which he starts, viz., that the charge
against Wordsworth, of 'profundity and transcendentalism,'
sprang from the same root as
that which declaims against his 'unintelligible
fuss about common feelings and common
things.' Still, in his anxiety to establish this
position, Mr. Hutton appears to us to overstate
the frugality of Wordsworth's genius, and to
exaggerate the poet's habit of making a very
minute modicum of incident furnish all the
material he needed for the exercise of his imagination
and the development of his vast subjective
energies. The entire series of ecclesiastical
sonnets, as well as those which were
dedicated to national independence, cover a
prodigious field, and make no inconsiderable
demand upon the reader's knowledge, as well
as upon his sympathy. In the description of
the retreat from Moscow, Wordsworth surely
chose a theme big enough for the historic imagination
of Scott, and he dealt with it in an as
objective a fashion, with Dryden's fire and
Shelley's pomp of style to boot. Again, in
Mr. Hutton's profoundly interesting paper on
the 'Poetry of the Old Testament,' there is a
principle which is full of force, and our
author's working hypothesis will and does explain
a great deal. He urges with eloquence
and beauty of illustration, that 'faith in the
glorious destiny of the nation, and the overseeing
providence of God as the power which
had wrought out that destiny,' are the two
roots of the Hebrew traditionary poems, and
he sees these roots in all the efflorescence of
the glorious tree; but while there is truth in
the remark that this double idea underlies and
absorbs the significance of all the Hebrew
poet's references to the beauty of nature, and
much also of the tragic human interest of the life
that was being lived by the prophets, there is
some niggardliness in failing to acknowledge
how the very fringes of the tabernacle that enshrined
both the nation's destiny and the Divine
presence are glittering with touches of refined
gold, and how much nearer an approach the
few Hebrews made to the modern conceptions
of the transcendent and pathetic beauty of
nature, than all the Greeks and Romans put
together.</p>

<p>If the Hebrews rose to the stupendous idea
of the universe being but the shadow of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
Jehovah's might, and believed that the light
was the skirt of His raiment, that the heavens,
the sun, moon, and stars, were the work of His
fingers, that the 'seven stars and Orion,' the
'sweet influence of Pleiades,' and 'the morning
spread upon the mountains,' were alike declaring
His glory, there is sufficient evidence
in the abundance of their imagery and the
sweetness of their song, that they exulted in
as well as beheld the primal beauty. Interesting
and demonstrative as Mr. Hutton's essay
is, he leaves a range of facts unaccounted for.
The gorgeous imagery of Ezekiel, when in
parabolic fashion he sees the analogies between
nature and national life, the idyllic, perhaps
dramatic grace of the Song of Songs, and the
genuine lyrical cry of large portions of the
minor prophets and Psalms, seem to us to transgress
the canon of our author.</p>

<p>One of the volumes before us consists of
eighteen theological essays, admirably classified.
They start from the moral and religious
significance of Atheism; they proceed to show
the insufficiency of the scientific and positivistic
explanation of our moral relations. The
Pantheistic hypothesis is displayed in its
strength and its weakness. The question,
'What is revelation?' is then handled, and Mr.
Maurice is vindicated and Dean Mansel demolished.
In another essay the historic problems
of the fourth Gospel are discussed with great
candour and success. 'The principles of evidence'
are illustrated in their application to
the 'Doctrine of Incarnation,' which our author,
like Mr. Baring-Gould, would hold, even if the
New Testament should pass out of existence.
Two papers on M. R&eacute;nan's recent works, and a
vehement attack upon the evangelical doctrine,
under the irritating title of 'The Hard Church,'
are followed by an estimate of the relative position
of the 'Romanists, Protestants, and
Anglicans.' Several of these papers were
published in the <i>National Review</i>, and one of
them forms part of a series of essays entitled
'Tracts for Priests and People.' We acknowledge
great obligation to Mr. Hutton for many
of these dissertations. We sympathise most
profoundly in the general estimate he forms of
the position of the Atheist, the Positivist, and
the Pantheist; and we are confident, after again
perusing his examination of 'the historical
problems of the fourth Gospel,' that though we
differ from him in many details, and regret
that he should find it necessary to relinquish
the Johannine authorship of the Apocalypse,
it is the noblest and most triumphant vindication
in the English language of this stronghold
of Christianity. In the graceful preface to the
first volume, in which Mr. Hutton acknowledges
his debt of obligation to Mr. Maurice, he
sums up in a sentence the living principle of
Mr. Maurice's writings. There, as elsewhere,
too much credit is given to a key; too much of
a jet of light is thrown upon a portion of Mr.
Maurice's theology. We do not believe that
this great and suggestive writer can be crushed
into a proposition. Still it does cover much of
the speculation associated with Mr. Maurice's
name. It is as follows:&mdash;'All beliefs about
God are but inadequate intellectual attempts
to justify a belief in Him, which is never a
merely intellectual affirmation, but rather a
living act of the spirit, by no means confined
to those who consciously confess His presence.'
The paper entitled 'What is Revelation?'
and part of the argument entitled 'The Hard
Church,' are expansions of this principle, in
vehement opposition to the philosophy of
Hamilton, as it was applied by Dean Mansel to
theological problems. We think that we may
give Mr. Hutton credit for having made the
difference between Dean Mansel and Professor
Maurice more obvious than those distinguished
men ever succeeded in making it appear for
themselves; but we imagine that he has forced
them into more irreconcilable antagonism than
they are themselves conscious of, and has effected
this by a slight exaggeration of the position
of each disputant. We sympathize with
Mr. Hutton far more than with Dean Mansel,
in his general philosophical opinions; but this
vehement scolding and irate horror caught
from Mr. Maurice seems to us perfectly misplaced.
Surely, surely the 'living act of the
spirit,' by which man knows the only true God,
the intuition of God by the eye of the soul,
the transcendental conclusion or conviction of
the whole intelligence, the bound heavenwards
of the sanctified imagination, the 'real assent'
to super-sensuous, extra-logical, metaphysical
facts, all of which processes are aided by the
facts and words of Scripture, by the recorded
life of Christ, by the sublime utterances and
confessions of the creeds, will not be rejected
by Dean Mansel. They are differently described
but thankfully acknowledged. What
Mansel seems to us to imply is that these processes
do not solve the contradictions which
are involved in the logical effort to formulate
the infinite; the knowledge they supply is
approximate rather than exhaustive, regulative
rather than absolute; a spiritual apprehension
rather than scientific comprehension. The
intuitions of Mr. Hutton and Mr. Maurice are
far more numerous and intense than Dean
Mansel's. Our author has more confidence in
his direct experiences of truth than Dean Mansel
has. The living God is more visible, more
accessible to some minds than others, and
these want less help and fewer manifestations
to penetrate the mystery; but we do not see
why Mr. Hutton should be so wrath with Dean
Mansel for the position that 'the faculties in
man furnish the conditions of constructing a
philosophical theory of the object presented.'
'The object presented' is not the living and
infinite God, but the finite manifestation and
unveiling of his perfections through a certain
series of human experiences. The criticism
of Mr. Hutton shows that he is attributing
to the words 'philosophical theory' more than
it is meant by Mansel to carry. It is just because
Dean Mansel cannot form a theory of the
underlying 'infinite' and the 'abysmal deep'
of human personality, that he is content to
theorize about that which is presented in the
person and voice and known history and
character of a human being. It is because the
infinite baffles and confounds us, and refuses
to come under the formal laws of thought,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
that Mansel and Hamilton made a virtue and
a science out of the recognition of our nescience,
and would confine their theorizing to that
which was manageable and apprehensible; but
the entire philosophy of the unconditioned turns
on the presence in our consciousness of these
stupendous factors, unlabelled and untheorized.
It appears to us that the conflict narrows itself
to the name to be given to our personal relations
with the transcendental and eternal realities
in which both disputants profoundly believe;
and therefore we do not for one moment
think that this summation of Dean Mansel's
position would be accepted by him. Can Mr.
Hutton really mean that Dean Mansel would
deny that we can be 'conscious of God's presence
with us, conscious of the life we receive
from Him, conscious of what He really is, and
in the same, indeed, even in far higher sense
than that in which we are conscious of what
human beings are?' We heartily agree with
Mr. Hutton in his denunciation of the idea
that the moral nature of man is fundamentally
different from the moral nature of God,
that the goodness and mercy of God's
being must be essentially different from the
goodness and mercy in a human will, and that
the 'revelation to us of the very character and
life of the Eternal God' has been made by the
'purification of human vision,' and is 'the
history of the awakening, purifying, and answering
of the yearnings of the human spirit
for a direct knowledge of Him. It proceeds
from God, and not from man.' He details
with clearness and force the spread of this
'revelation,' the human condition of it, and the
widely diffused material of it, in the instincts
and regrets, and secret hopes and fears of universal
man. 'The revelation through Christ
fulfilled ... the desire of all nations, by
revealing the living power in man, by which
human nature is wrought into His likeness.'
But in his defence of this position he appears
to us partially, if not utterly, to ignore the new
life given to our humanity in Christ. 'Grace'
seems on this theory rather to be a development
of dormant powers than the conference of a
new tendency, and 'Christ' to become rather
the name of a sleeping but universal divineness
in all humanity, which is at length realized to
the conscience, rather than to be the personal
source of all the life. The 'Father,' in
the theology of Mr. Hutton, is a living God, as
against the Pantheistic tendencies of modern
science; but we are not sure&mdash;and few things
would be farther from our wish than to misrepresent
him&mdash;that the Christ and the Spirit of
God are distinguishable from the voice of universal
conscience and the hidden and better
nature of the (not fallen but) ever aspiring
child of the living God.</p>

<p>Each of Mr. Hutton's papers deserves careful
study; we regret that we cannot even refer
to more than one other, and this, moreover,
one to which we cannot fail to take certain exceptions.
It is entitled 'The Hard Church,' a
'degraded phase of the Church of common
sense.' It is the Church whose logic has been
supplied by Whately, whose metaphysic has
been elaborated by Dr. Mansel; one of its
most 'merciless and slashing captains' is seen
in Professor Henry Rogers, and Mr. Binney
caught its exact spirit in his lecture addressed
to young persons on the possibility of 'Making
the best of both Worlds.' 'Its heroes,' we
are told, are 'latitudinarian but not catholic in
the tone of their theology.' It has no sympathy,
no heart, offers 'no divine reconciliation of contradictory
yearnings;' it glories in 'hard sense,'
and 'dismisses from view all those fluctuating
elements of human life which do not seem
deeply imbedded in the average notions of average
men.' Its representatives scold away all
individuality, denounce the eccentricities of
positive faith, and are, in short, 'the most mischievous
section of Christendom.' All this is
introductory to a tremendous attack on Mr.
Rogers for the pitiless severity with which he
introduces a thoroughly sceptical mind, seeing
no <i>intellectual</i> standing-place in a 'shallow
Deism,' and more consistency in thoroughfaced
Positivism or Pantheism, and more hope too,
because he is sure that at the very bottom of
the abyss, the heart will spring upward and
the conscience will rise in rebellion. Mr. Hutton
should remember that 'the real and deep
Theism, holding by prayer, near to Christianity,'
was not the intellectual position condemned
by the author of 'The Eclipse of Faith;' it
was a Theism that is or was in a fluent and
changeable condition, a Theism that had, in
deference to certain loudly-vaunted principles
of reasoning, relinquished Christianity, and
spoken of the moral character of Jesus&mdash;to
put it mildly&mdash;with disloyalty if not with disrespect;
it was a Theism trembling on the
verge of Atheism, yet boasting itself to be a
spiritual religion. Methods of thought may
surely be harmless in some regions, and deadly
in other spheres. It is not hardness but goodness
which exposes the worthlessness of the
method. This seems to us to have been the
work of Mr. Rogers. We are not called upon
to defend Mr. Rogers's strong way of putting
certain things, but we think that Mr. Hutton
has not shown him a more excellent way when
he speaks of his 'throttling art,' and would
give you to believe that he is a spiritual garotter,
rather perhaps of the Ant&aelig;us proportions,
who has at last found a Hercules. Mr. Hutton
appears to us to be too angry to see the
genuine humour as well as rather grim pleasantry
with which Mr. Rogers has represented the
enemies of the Christianity infinitely dear to
him as destroying each other. The doctrine
that 'Christianity is against the grain of human
nature,' is spoken of as demonstrating the
truth that 'the Hard Church has a hard Master.'
Nothing surely is more true than this
language of Mr. Rogers, and we are astonished
that Mr. Hutton thinks he replies to this estimate
of Christianity by saying that Paul told
the Athenians that they were 'seeking the
Lord, if haply they might feel after Him and
find Him.' Our author is generally quite ready
to admit the complexity of human nature, the
multiplicity of the forces that are moving it.
The same apostle who thus spake to Athenians,
said to Galatians, 'Brethren, if I yet preach
circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
then is the offence of the Cross ceased.' We
can conceive of no more satisfactory response
to the position here assailed than that so often
attributed to Lord Palmerston, 'that all children
are born good.' We suppose Mr. Hutton
must endorse it. The paper on 'Romanism,
Protestantism, and Anglicanism' cannot be
discussed by us here for want of space. Its
delicate insight into 'root-principles,' and formulated
tendencies, is another illustration of
the author's disposition to generalise, and to
cast pencils of coloured light upon the parts
of a theme, or of a system of thought. With
the general estimate of <i>Luther</i> we have not
much to contend against, except that no reference
is made to the objects or reasons of his
faith. The unlimited, ecstatic, violent confidence
in an unproved, transcendental fact, with
nothing but personal intuitions to guide the
triumphant <i>trust</i>&mdash;itself a Saviour&mdash;may be
apparently proved from certain table-talk of Luther,
but is a very imperfect exhibition of Luther's
position. Why, by implication, should
all whom Mr. Hutton calls 'pseudo-Protestants'
be supposed to deny the indispensable
necessity of an entire moral surrender of the
whole nature to the will of God? With some
of those whom Mr. Hutton thus denounces, as
for example, Bishop Bull and all who agree
with him, faith is identifiable with moral surrender
to the will of God; in the view of others,
as proved by almost all the Protestant confessions,
it is inseparably associated with saving
trust. Where, we ask, is 'the bibliolatry
which relegates the Holy Spirit to the province
of explaining the Bible,' except in a small section
of Scotch divines, whose hard and artificial
lines have long since shown a tendency
to vanish away? Mr. Hutton seems to try to
take from those whose joy and crown it is to
speak of trust in a present Christ their most
distinctive feature; because here and there a
logical theologian may use scholastic or forensic
phrases in his theorizing, it is ungenerous to
say that 'the passionate faith of Luther is degraded
into the acceptance of an artificial contract,'
or that 'the orthodox theory of substitution
excludes the purifying influence of
spiritual union with Christ.' The best reply
that we can make to Mr. Hutton's contemptuous
allusion to Dr. Candlish is to call his attention
to Dr. Candlish's sermon on 'His servants
shall serve Him,' and to the greater part
of his Commentary on the first Epistle of St.
John. Would that our great thinkers succeeded
in learning more of each other's mind!
There are a hundred other questions raised by
Mr. Hutton on which it is tempting but difficult
to dilate. We cannot part from him, however,
without assuring him that we believe
these volumes will gain what they richly deserve&mdash;a
high place in English literature. Our
remarks have been somewhat critical and dissatisfied,
but we are anxious to express, notwithstanding,
the exceeding admiration which
we feel for these eloquent and noble essays.
It is often most instructive to see how the
position we occupy shapes itself to the intelligence
of one who is only in partial sympathy
with us.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>First Principles of Ecclesiastical Truth.</i> Essays
on the Church and Society. By <span class="smcap">J.
Baldwin Brown</span>, B.A. Hodder and Stoughton.</p>

<p>This volume consists of ten essays: the first
four are entitled 'The Doctrine of the Infallible,'
and contain Mr. Brown's exposition of the
inquiry&mdash;What is truth? a brave and full exhibition
of the answer to that question given
by the infallible church; a criticism of the
Protestant dictum that an infallible book is
adequate to the solution of every great moral
and spiritual problem; and in the last place a
passionate vindication for the free spirit of the
possession of the true infallibility. Two essays
then follow, of considerable speculative
interest, under the titles of 'The Natural History
of Antichrist,' and 'The Christian Commonwealth.'
The volume is completed by
four lecture essays on the 'Revolution of the
last Quarter of a Century,' the intellectual, social,
ecclesiastical and theological revolution
which has unrolled itself during the twenty-five
years of Mr. Brown's fruitful and stimulating
ministry. We have said enough to indicate
the comprehensiveness and multifariousness of
the theme which our author has here investigated.
It is as though he had taken his stand
on some high promontory which overlooks a
boundless sea of thought, and with well practised,
almost prophetic eye, taken in the vast
expanse, the rolling tides, the brooding storms
of the great highway of the nations; here a
very maelstr&ouml;m of confusion and wreathing
agony, where equatorial and arctic currents
blend in driving mist and fierce agitation, and
there a dreamy outlook of serene though glittering
colour; now, the breaker and the wreck
and then the ark of refuge, the busy craft, the
haven of rest. Few writers of the present
day appear to us to take a larger view of men
and things, and though his senses seem painfully
acute to the moan of distress and the
shriek of the torment, yet few appear to hear
more distinctly the sound of the Master's voice,
or to see more clearly the triumphant form of
Him who holds that ocean in the hollow of His
hand.</p>

<p>We think this volume is unquestionably the
noblest production of Mr. Baldwin Brown's
pen. In refinement and elevation of style, in
high sympathy with the good and the noble
side of that which he condemns, in readiness
to learn from his opponents, and to see himself
and his own position with their eyes, amounting
to what some may deem almost a dangerous
concession to the misconception of the free
spirit entertained by both the Romish doctor
and the apostle of science, coupled with outspoken
and brave utterance of unpopular truth,
this volume will hardly find its parallel in
modern times.</p>

<p>We cannot attempt more than to touch on a
few points. We are inclined to think that the
paper on 'The Natural History of Antichrist'
is not only the most original and suggestive
portion of the volume, but that it is, in fact,
the pivot, or the centre of the entire argument.
Our author has drawn a comparison between
'Babel,' 'Babylon,' and 'Babylon the Great,'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
and has shown how the hoary legend of man's
first endeavour to establish a worldly and
human independence of the Supreme will,
found its counterpart in the subsequent efforts
to produce the four world-wide monarchies of
pre-Christian times, and again, in the towering
system of Pontifical rule, the rise, triumph,
and fall of which are seen in the visions of
Patmos. He has discussed with consummate
eloquence and brilliancy of touch, the analogies
which link these three manifestations of the
spirit of antichrist, and how God's providence
has undermined them one after the other by a
like energy of the individual conscience and
the free spirit. The paper on the 'Christian
Commonwealth' provides a delicately-sketched
theory of the true relation between the governing
and the Christian spirit. Mr. Brown admits,
nay, contends, for the fact that the
Church and the State in their last significance
and highest development are one, and argues
with great ingenuity that a supposed alliance
between the Church and the State, as between
two contracting parties, is essentially unchristian;
it is, moreover, 'an exceedingly low and
false conception of the true character of the
National Establishment, and is quite unsupported
by its early history.' He acknowledges
the difficulty of realizing the Christian idea in
any Christian State, and asserts 'that the
Gospel has still a missionary function in every
State in Christendom; men have not only to
be helped to live by it, they have to be persuaded
to believe in it;' but 'that the idea of a
National Church whose rulers are clergy,
which shall have the whole spiritual interests
of the community in charge, having its own
ordinances, officers, and laws, of which it is
the only lawful custodian and administrator,
lending a Christian character to the State by
its alliance, and deriving material countenance
and support from the State in return, is simply
anti-Christian. The only National Church is
the whole community which has been redeemed
by Christ, and on which, and in which, He is
working as the head of the Church in a thousand
ways, of which theologians of all parties
little dream.'</p>

<p>Mr. Brown differs from many Nonconformists
in holding the competency of the public
assemblies of a Christian State to deal with
spiritual matters, and would prefer to have
such regulation as the British Parliament
might supply to religious belief and life to that
of any 'spiritual synod that he is acquainted
with;' but he considers that a body like the
British Parliament may and must 'abstain
from all attempt at legislation on certain subjects,
because they know that they would only
mar them if they were to touch them with
their legal fingers.' He does not think that
domestic sympathies and affections, the higher
intellectual life of the community, or the religious
life of the people, are palpably beyond
the sphere of a government, but that they are
beyond 'their power. One shudders to think
of the costly, wasteful, pompous, grasping,
titled, beneficed, wealthy and bigoted thing
which has been presented during three hundred
years to the English people, as the visible
embodiment of His kingdom, who was the incarnation
of tenderness, compassion, purity,
patience, gentleness, and love. The Establishment
principle, under the most favourable conditions,
seems to run directly counter to the
fundamental principle of the spiritual government
of men as we watch it working through
all the ages. It belongs to the age of stagnancy
and deadness, is vested in the old and
decaying order, is doomed, and must die.' The
theoretical admission of competency, coupled
with the trenchant disavowal of power to deal
with the higher regions of the social and religious
life of the people, reminds us of the
ground taken for some years by a large section
of the free kirk of Scotland. There is no
practical difference between the views held by
Mr. Brown and by the bulk of Nonconformists;
his condemnation of the Establishment principle
is at least the result of experience, and
appears to be final.</p>

<p>As Christianity and the Church are the form
and life of the truth, Mr. Brown has prepared
the way for his discussion of both by his discourses
on the infallible. The first paper,
entitled 'What is Truth?' exhibits with painful
intensity the anguish, even the torment that
accompanies the search after this hidden treasure.
Expressing, as we suppose, the feelings
of others rather than his own, the signs of the
times rather than his own heart-throbbings,
his language almost amounts occasionally to a
wail of despair: nor does he, in the discourse
which is entitled the 'Intellectual Revolution
of the last Quarter of a Century,' exonerate
the Christian teachers of the present day from
the charge of augmenting that despair. After
clearly expounding the theory of the Positivist,
and showing how in its isolation it fails to
satisfy the need of either the intelligence or
the heart of man, he boldly charges theology
and the Church with the sin of giving to
science such a representation of God as to induce
it to do without him. In his extreme
anxiety to do justice to the scientific spirit, Mr.
Brown appears to us to do some injustice to
the age-long yearning after truth which has
characterized theological science. Perhaps he
does not sufficiently take notice that the mental
faculties which are quite adequate to secure
the broadest generalizations of science are insufficient
to furnish us with some of the chief
data of theology. He speaks with perfect confidence
of 'common ground in our Christian
belief for us and the leaders of the intellectual
progress of men.' We believe that this common
ground will be found only when the
methods of theology and the methods of
science are alike seen to be incomplete; but a
difference of method in the two regions there
must ever be.</p>

<p>In the paper on 'the Infallible Church,' our
author frankly admits that there must be infallibility
somewhere. With high courage and
honesty he traces the confidence with which
the Catholic Church has entertained a consciousness
of the unerring guidance of the
Holy Spirit, and he has done much to show
how reasonable is the expectation of such a
guidance and the truth that underlies the celebrated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
dictum of St. Vincent of Lerins; and
with distinguished skill he has indicated the
way in which vagueness and uncertainty have
forced some of the strongest minds in the
Romish Church to sigh after and ultimately to
secure the definition of a Papal infallibility.
Few things are more remarkable than the
steady growth of this yearning in face of the
proved forgeries and infinite gullibility on
which the modern dogma conspicuously rests.
Mr. Brown thinks that some deep necessities
of human nature must be the explanation of
this mystery. We believe he need not go
much deeper than the ignorance, credulity,
laziness, cowardice, and abjectness of the
human mind, and the wide-spread incapacity,
independently of the Holy Spirit, for the
spiritual apprehension of transcendental
truth. In his papers on the infallible
book and the doctrine of Christ, Mr. Brown
has shown how dependent a man with the
Bible in his hand must ever be, on the
spiritual presence and indwelling light of the
Comforter. He may almost be said to have
drawn Bossuet's rapier from its scabbard, and
made some vigorous passes at the 'variations
of Protestantism;' but it is not that he may
turn back to an infallible Pope for guidance or
for rest, but that he might fight his way past
sects and churches, and dogmas and popes,
into the true temple, where all who have received
the fulness of the spirit are worshipping
their father. As we have already said, Mr.
Brown opens up so many controversies, and
displays such varied culture and exceeding
fairness in his treatment of these high themes,
that we will now content ourselves with urging
our readers to peruse the whole volume.</p>

<p class="hang p2"><i>The Office and Work of the Christian Ministry.</i>
By <span class="smcap">James M. Hoppin</span>, Professor of Homiletics
and Pastoral Theology in Yale College.
Second Edition. New York: Sheldon and
Co. 1870.</p>

<p>This elaborate course on homiletics and pastoral
theology may be said almost to exhaust the
subject. The history of preaching, the art of
preaching, the analysis of a sermon in all its
various parts, from the text to the peroration,
constitute the first part of the homiletical manual.
The second part contains a series of valuable
dissertations on the application of rhetoric
to preaching. The pastoral office is then examined
in its divine institution, in its ideal, in
the call to its high functions, and the ordination
to the office. The author further discusses the
pastor as a man, the pastor in his relations to
society, and the pastor in his relations to the
Church. Here Dr. Hoppin investigates the
conduct of public worship, and under this
heading such details even as church music,
marriages, and funerals are included. Finally
the whole question of the care and cure of
souls is wisely and affectionately urged upon
the student. We have never seen a more complete
treatise on the question with which the
author deals. There is not much room for
originality, and the analytical tone of the discussion
precludes the presence of much enthusiasm
or fire. There is an abundance of wise,
godly counsel, and a considerable reference to
the literature of the subject.</p>

<p class="center p2">SERMONS.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>Sermons Preached in the Temple Church.</i>
By the Rev. <span class="smcap">Alfred Ainger</span>, M.A., Reader at
the Temple Church. (Macmillan and Co.) There
is about Mr. Ainger's sermons the great charm
of perfect simplicity, unconventionally, intelligence,
and fearlessness. Neither in style nor
in thought are they like any sermons that we
can recall. They are not eloquent; or if so, it
is the eloquence of a perfectly transparent medium
of thought. Not a fine word or a rhetorical
figure occurs in them; but neither is
there anything commonplace. It is the fresh,
unconventional talk of a clear, independent
thinker, addressed to a congregation of thinkers.
The uncultured would have no difficulty in understanding;
but the colourless thought would
fail long to interest such. For popular effect,
it wants sensuousness and passion, and, therefore,
rhetoric. Mr. Ainger belongs to the liberal-orthodox
school; but he does not shape his
opinions to any school. He speaks right out
what he thinks, and often surprises us with
fresh views of familiar texts. He is not great;
but he is unconventional and earnest. In doctrine
he is broad, not however in any sense that
is inconsistent with what are understood by
Evangelical views. The moral aspects of the
Atonement&mdash;forgiveness of sins, regeneration,
and the life to come&mdash;which he exhibits, are the
highest truths of the Gospel; but he exhibits
them with such predominance, almost exclusiveness,
that he is apt to forget his own principle
that the Atonement of Christ has many aspects.
Thoughtful men will be greatly charmed by
this little volume; they will learn from its perusal
how the Gospel of Christ commends itself
to all the mind as well as to all the heart of
men. The sermons, moreover, are preached in
the light of the thought of the present day, and
are rich glimpses of great questions now stirring
men's hearts.&mdash;<i>The City Temple Sermons,
Preached in the Poultry Chapel, London,</i>
1869-70. By <span class="smcap">Joseph Parker</span>, D.D. (Hodder
and Stoughton.) Dr. Parker, also, is a City
preacher; but, perhaps, the three kingdoms
could not furnish a greater pulpit contrast than
between him and Mr. Ainger. Dr. Parker's
sermons are much stronger, but they are far
less thoughtful. They are more rhetorical, but
less beautifully clear. They are abrupt, striking,
sensational in style, and abound with
rhetorical devices for catching the ear of the
multitude. Sometimes, for instance, Dr. Parker
renounces the idea of a sermon, and tells a
story, after the manner of the Parables. His
sermons often offend good taste, and are to be
excused only on the ground that the end justifies
the means. Certainly Mr. Ainger could
not do what Dr. Parker is doing at the Poultry.&mdash;<i>Christ
Satisfying the Instincts of Humanity.</i>
Eight Lectures delivered in the Temple Church.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
By <span class="smcap">C. J. Vaughan</span>, D.D. (Macmillan.) <i>Half-hours
in the Temple Church.</i> By <span class="smcap">C. J.
Vaughan</span>, D.D., Master of the Temple. (Strahan
and Co.) <i>Counsels to Young Students.</i>
Three Sermons preached before the University
of Cambridge at the opening of the academical
year 1870-71. By <span class="smcap">C. J. Vaughan</span>, D.D.
(Macmillan and Co.) Concerning three new
books by the author of upwards of twenty
volumes of published sermons, it is almost
enough to say that they are his: only these
sermons, while preserving the admirable simplicity
and practical spiritual unction of the
parochial sermons, have more of intellectual
fibre. The conception of the first series addresses
itself more to thinking men, and the
treatment has a more thoughtful cast. Seven
of these letters were delivered on Wednesday
evenings in Lent, the eighth on a Sunday just
after. The instincts which Christ is represented
as satisfying are the instincts of Truth,
Reverence, Perfection, Liberty, Courage, Sympathy,
Sacrifice, and Unity. The only text of
doubtful relevancy is that of the sermon on
Courage, taken from the Corinthians, 'Quit
you like men.' It is matter for devout thankfulness
that a preacher so single-hearted, so
practical, so faithful to evangelical truth, and
so spiritual, should address so large a number
of the learned profession on the great themes
of the Gospel, and that these qualities should
find such acceptance as they do. The crowds
who gather round the Temple pulpit prove that
preachers need have recourse neither to strange
doctrines nor to oddities of manner to make the
Gospel attractive. Dr. Vaughan must preach
almost all that he thinks, as he prints almost all
that he preaches. His sermons have the natural,
simple strength and freshness of an intelligent,
scholarly, and devout man. They are not
made, they grow; if they may not claim the
merit of great originality, they are in every wise
and wholesome sense independent. There is
no reason why his series of little volumes
should not go on for ever, and certainly we
have every desire that they should. Dr.
Vaughan's devout, spirit-searching fidelity, and
evangelical theology, make his books almost
everything that we could desire them to be for
popular religious reading. There can be no
better sign of our times than the favour with
which such books are received. Because Dr.
Vaughan's sermons are the simple, spontaneous
outcome of his mind and heart, they always
have an admirable adaptation, whether to the
alumni of Cambridge or to the lawyers of the
Temple. He speaks with exact pertinence, and
therefore with power. We are devoutly thankful
that both these classes should hear such
faithful, searching, loving words as are addressed
to them respectively in these three volumes.&mdash;<i>The
Lost Found, and the Wanderer
Welcomed.</i> By the Rev. <span class="smcap">W. M. Taylor</span>, M.A.,
U.P., Liverpool. (Edinburgh: Oliphant and
Co.) A lively series of expository and practical
homilies on the fifteenth chapter of Luke's
Gospel. Almost too lively at times, when the
Prodigal Son is represented as departing to the
'El Dorado of his dreams,' and hopes to return
a 'nabob;' but there is a dash, and force, and
sweetness withal, that render the volume impressive
and attractive.&mdash;<i>Tender Herbs; or,
Lessons for the Lambs</i>. By <span class="smcap">George W. Conder</span>.
(Manchester: Tubbs and Brook; London:
Kent and Co.) Few more charming
volumes than this have ever been prepared for
young Christians. A 'Little Bunch of Herbs
for the Lambs,' the author calls them; but
they have rare fragrance and beauty. Under
such titles as 'The Broken Vase,' 'Thistle
Gardens,' 'The Coat and the Dream,' 'The
Golden Key,' 'The Shepherd and the Lambs,'
Mr. Conder pours forth his affluent treasures of
tender fancy and abounding affection. Underneath
the almost playful tone of some of his
addresses, and the genial kindness of all, there
is plenty of strong masculine sense, of vigorous
and noble thought, of original and novel argument.&mdash;<i>A
Practical Commentary on the Gospel
of St. John, in Simple and Familiar
Language</i>. By G. B. (Nisbet and Co.) Evangelical
but feeble.&mdash;<i>Life and Truth; or, Bible
Thoughts and Themes</i>. <i>The Lesser Epistles.</i>
By <span class="smcap">Horatius Bonar</span>, D.D. (Nisbet and Co.)
In our notice of the two previous volumes of
this series we have sufficiently characterized
the sermons of which it consists. Dr. Bonar
seems to have been guided in the selection of
passages for texts simply by his sympathetic
fancy. In his treatment he is somewhat ultra-orthodox,
deeply spiritual, not very critical, and
not very original or striking. He is closely
textual, and in his frame-work of divisions, resembles
some of the old Puritans, rather than
divines of the present day. Eighty-five discourses,
in a small volume, necessitate brevity;
they are, indeed, outlines rather than compositions.
Perhaps we may best convey an idea of
their character when we say they resemble
Chalmers' 'Daily Readings;' only they have
more of a sermon-plan in them&mdash;sometimes a
division or sub-division is dismissed in a sentence.
Their most fitting designation would be
'Sermons in Outline.'&mdash;<i>Symbols of Christ.</i> By
<span class="smcap">Charles Stanford</span>. (Hodder and Stoughton.)
A second edition of a little book that has commended
itself to devout readers by its healthy
spiritual tone of devout practical religiousness.
Mr. Stanford has just that tinge of mysticism
which spiritualises events, and uses emblems
with unction; but he never becomes mawkish
or obscure. His sermons are pure and breezy;
emotion is appealed to and excited in an intelligent,
manly way. Hence few more wholesome
helps to the spiritual life could be named.
This is a companion volume to the edition of
'Central Truths,' which we commended on its
appearance a few months ago.&mdash;<i>Sermons on
Historical Subjects.</i> By the Rev. <span class="smcap">D. Rowlands</span>,
B.A. (Hodder &amp; Stoughton.) Mr. Rowlands'
sermons are ingenious and effective. In some
of them he is remarkably happy in seizing and
condensing into a paragraph or two the essence
of a great lesson; thus the sermon on Jacob's
dream at Bethel treats&mdash;1. The 'Duality of
Existence;' 2. The 'Unity of Existence.' The
treatment is sometimes inadequate, an undue
space being given to mere description with
which imagination has a good deal to do. On
the whole, the sermons may be commended as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
fresh, sensible, vigorous, and useful.&mdash;<i>Sermons</i>.
By <span class="smcap">Henry Melville</span>. Two volumes. (Rivingtons.)
Sermon readers will feel a great obligation
to the publishers for this cheap reprint
of the sermons of one of the most effective
preachers of this generation. We are not too
old to remember the electrical way in which,
for an hour, the preacher at Camden Chapel
held spell-bound the multitudes that crowded
every available corner: A severe critic might
characterise Mr. Melville's preaching as somewhat
artificial, and his sermons as fanciful and
sometimes wire-drawn; but they are full of
unction, and contain precious evangelical truth
enforced in a way not to be forgotten. We
hope these volumes will be succeeded by others.&mdash;<i>Beacons
and Patterns; or, Lessons for Young
Men.</i> By the Rev. <span class="smcap">W. Landels</span>, D.D. (Hodder
and Stoughton.) These sermons, on some
of the historical characters of Scripture, containing
lessons specially adapted to young men,
are reprinted from 'The Bible Student.' They
rise to that level of popular excellence which
characterizes all that Dr. Landels does, and are
calculated to be useful.&mdash;<i>The Prophet's Mantle.</i>
Being Scenes from the Life of Elisha, the Son of
Shaphat. By the Rev. <span class="smcap">James Murray</span>, Minister
of Old Cumnoch. (Blackwood &amp; Son.) An
exceedingly good example of the expository
preaching to which, much more than ourselves,
our Scottish brethren are given. Mr. Murray,
while evidently having a scholarly acquaintance
with critical difficulties, knows how to keep
them subordinate to popular statement and
practical uses. Great good sense characterises
all that he says, and regulates every touch.
The sermons are Biblical rather than practical,
that is, they simply furnish a running practical
comment upon the Biblical narrative. Really
useful preaching demands somewhat larger and
wider uses suited to the practical life of our
own day; the historical instance should not
have larger prominence than its application.&mdash;<i>Sermons.</i>
By <span class="smcap">Charles Wadsworth</span>. San Francisco.
(R. D. Dickenson.) We welcome this
volume of sermons from the rapidly-growing
and vigorous Christian life of San Francisco,
where, as everywhere else throughout the
States, religious provision fully keeps up with
the rapid growth of the community. Mr. Wadsworth's
sermons have some of the characteristics
of Western life: they are full of vigour,
fire, and fearlessness, but with that defective
culture of form which in its excess is designated
pedantry. The thought is cast in a scholastic
form, the scientific illustrations are often
in excess, and the style wants ease and simplicity;
hard words and harsh compounds occur,
and, together with this, the practical applications
are too ejaculatory and coercive. Mr.
Wadsworth will do better as he mellows, but
his volume is able and has much good stuff in
it.&mdash;<i>Foreign Protestant Pulpit.</i> Sermons by
eminent Preachers of France, Germany, Holland,
and Switzerland. Second Series. (R. D.
Dickinson). We can only adduce as vouchers
for the great excellency of this volume the
names of the preachers of these six-and-thirty
sermons; they are Lange, Grandpierre, C&eacute;sar,
Malan, Horace Monod, Tholuck, Bersier,
Hocart, Gaussen, Krummacher, Luthardt,
Schwartz, Rothe, Pressens&eacute;, and Julius M&uuml;ller.
In addition to the intrinsic excellence of the
sermons, they have the exciting freshness of
modes of religious thought and pulpit presentation
which are different from our own; they
seem to be well translated, their flavour is
carefully retained. We cordially commend
them to both sermon preachers and sermon
readers.&mdash;<i>The True Vine; or, the Analogies of
our Lord's Allegory.</i> By Rev. <span class="smcap">Hugh Macmillan</span>.
(Macmillan and Co.) Mr. Macmillan
combines the eye of a poet and the knowledge
of a <i>savant</i> with the heart of a saint; while he
analyses the phenomena of nature on purely
scientific principles, he interprets them on the
principles of a devout Christian theist. He
sees in nature the wonderful ways of Him who
made it; 'looks through nature up to nature's
God,' and often, in virtue of his religious insight,
invests familiar things with unobserved
and beautiful significance. Beneath the surface
of natural symbolism he discerns the religious
and loving ways of a divine Creator and
father; and thus, in a subtle and beautiful
way, he knits together the two great departments
of the one kingdom of God. In this
volume he is primarily a theologian, investigating
the religious meaning of our Lord's great
allegory of the vine and its branches&mdash;perhaps
the greatest of his self-assertions on the one
hand, and of his religious assurances on the
other. Mr. Macmillan here, therefore, makes
science the handmaid of theology, and brings
his knowledge of natural phenomena to bear
upon the significance of our Lord's similes.
He has, we think, a little overdone this; the
religious thought is overlaid, the illustration is
more than the thing illustrated; but he has
thrown beautiful light upon many points of
natural symbolism. Readers and preachers
who are unscientific will find many of his illustrations
as valuable as they are beautiful. His
wild luxuriance somewhat reminds us of that
of James Hamilton.&mdash;<i>Truth and Trust: Lessons
of the War.</i> Four Advent Sermons. By
<span class="smcap">Henry Alford</span>, D.D. (Hodder and Stoughton.)
These are the last products of Dean Alford's
pen, the last utterances from his lips. The
proof was but partly corrected when he died.
We could not subject them to criticism if we
would. They are 'the sound of a voice that is
still,' and love for an honoured and noble-hearted
servant of God, and for a dear personal
friend, seals our lips in reverence. Under any
circumstances, we should have only words of
eulogy for them. They are, in spiritual intelligence,
strength, and cogency, about the best
of the many sermons that he published.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The
Jewish Temple and the Christian Church</span>; a
Series of Discourses on the Epistle to the
Hebrews. By <span class="smcap">R. W. Dale</span>, M.A. Second
Edition. Revised, with additional notes. (Hodder
and Stoughton). We cannot but regret
that Mr. Dale has not made this volume much
more than 'discourses, not for scholars, but for
ordinary Christian people to whom learned
commentaries are inaccessible or useless.' He
has in them laid the foundations of an exposition
of the Epistle to the Hebrews of great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
spiritual insight and philosophic breadth, and
he might advantageously have wrought out his
plan, even in successive editions, until the
work had become the worthy <i>magnum opus</i> of
his life. It is, however, useless regretting
what he has not done; we can simply commend
what he has done, as one of the best popular
hand-books to this great and suggestive epistle
that is extant. Pulpit purposes demand broad
treatment and the avoidance of minute exegesis;
but the broad treatment here is always
the fruit of careful exegesis, good scholarship,
and sound, vigorous thought. Some of the
sermons are not even wrought out as they were
preached; the notes thereof only are given. It
is virtually what Robinson's 'Lectures on the
Corinthians' are, and will scarcely suffer by
comparison with them.&mdash;<i>Lights and Shadows in
the Life of King David.</i> By <span class="smcap">Charles Vince</span>.
(Elliot Stock.) In ten discourses, Mr. Vince
selects certain incidents and points in the history
of David. He makes no pretension to
biographical completeness, or to relative importance.
Spiritual, and not biographical, reasons
have guided his selections. Thus one
discourse is devoted to the influence of Rizpah's
pathetic fidelity in quickening David's conscience;
and two to the two things which David
had never seen&mdash;'the righteous forsaken, and
his seed begging their bread.' The volume is a
very charming one&mdash;full of delicate spiritual
discernment and tender religious sensibility;
the style is simple and chaste; and the quiet,
natural way in which the practical side of
everything is presented is very felicitous. Mr.
Vince does not 'strive nor cry;' he has recourse
to no feverish rhetoric or tumultuous
passion; his doctrine 'distils as the dew,' and,
in a searching, potent way, finds the soul of
every hearer and saturates it.&mdash;<i>Misread Passages
of Scripture.</i> Second Series. By <span class="smcap">J.
Baldwin Brown</span>, B.A. (Hodder and Stoughton.)
Very different is Mr. Brown, who is
urgent with intellectual force and moral earnestness.
His thought is inquisitive, aggressive,
and demonstrative; his spiritual zeal takes
cogent forms. He is full of intellectual surprises
and unexpected spiritual motives; very
independent, very instructive, very forcible,
fulfilling the great practical religious ends of
the ministry in a masterly, forceful way. His
books are full of strong, wise, earnest words,
such as place him among the noblest teachers
of our day. Nothing could be more characteristic
of him than these two series of sermons
on 'Misread Passages.' In the second, as distinguished
from the first which treats chiefly of
textual misinterpretations, Mr. Brown deals
with doctrines and conclusions derived from
misinterpreted texts; <i>e.g.</i>, 'The Principle of
Christian Unity,' regarded in the light of the
true reading. 'There shall be one <i>flock</i> and
one shepherd,' instead of 'one <i>fold</i> and one
shepherd;' and the true significance of the
simile of the potter and the clay. We commend
to special attention the sermon on the 'True
Idea of Substitution,' in which, denying the
theories of mere martyrdom and commercial
substitution, Mr. Brown insists upon the substitution
which has its character and power in
Christ as the <i>representative</i> of the race&mdash;the
true theory, as we venture to think. The volume
is full of thoughtfulness, light, and power.&mdash;<i>The
Story of Job, and Meditation on Passages
of the Book of Job.</i> By Rev. <span class="smcap">Alfred
Clayton Thistleton</span>. (Nisbet and Co.) There
is no distinctive character either of intelligence
or strength in Mr. Thistleton's sermons. They
are devout and practical, but very commonplace,
abounding in unctuous words, and not
over careful about exact meanings.&mdash;<i>Sermons
for the Christian Year.</i> By the Rev. <span class="smcap">W. H.
Lewis</span>, D.D., Rector of the Church of the Holy
Trinity, Brooklyn. (R. D. Dickinson.) A reprint
of a volume of sermons published twenty
years ago. It is a poor criterion of sermons to
measure them by the clock&mdash;a poor compliment
when the first commendation is of shortness;
but Mr. Lewis's sermons have this merit. This
little volume of 500 pages contains sixty-six.
Few of them could have exceeded the orthodox
Episcopal fifteen minutes. We differ from
many of the tenets of Mr. Lewis. Thus, from
the text, 'Cease ye from man,' he teaches that
we are from human corruption to expect only
ingratitude and wrong, to live among men as
among natural enemies. This is a very doleful
and, we think, an unwarrantable doctrine. Mr.
Lewis is an orthodox evangelical. He discourses
in the old mechanical way. He is
pious, sincere, and earnest, but he furnishes no
great help for men struggling with the real
difficulties of human darkness and experience.
The volume is typical, and should be very useful
to rectors.&mdash;<i>The Measure of Faith and
other Sermons.</i> By <span class="smcap">Philip Colborne</span>, Norwich.
With Preface by the Rev. <span class="smcap">John Stoughton</span>,
D.D. (Hodder and Stoughton.) Mr. Colborne's
sermons are thoroughly individual, as if
elaborated in some solitary place, with but little
reference either to theologians, critics, or conventional
modes of preaching. They somewhat
lack fluency, but they are vigorous and discerning.
The working out of Mr. Colborne's
conceptions is not always so happy as the conceptions
themselves; but his little volume
contrasts nobly with the vague vapid stuff that
often comes before us under the guise of sermons,
and is a favourable specimen of that
strength of the Nonconformist pulpit which,
under God's blessing, has made our churches
what they are. We would specially commend
the sermon on 'Christian Heroism,' and the
two sermons on 'The Origin of Christian Life,'
and 'God's Principle of Selection,' preached
during the meetings in Norwich of the British
Association.&mdash;<i>Christ's Healing Touch, and
other Sermons, preached at Surbiton.</i> By
<span class="smcap">Alexander Mackennal</span>, B.A. (Elliot Stock.)
Mr. Mackennal's sermons combine, in an unusual
degree, the freshness of an independent
thinker and the power of a robust one, with the
spiritual penetration of a devout man, the
evangelical fervour of a believing man, and the
practical urgency of an earnest man. No one,
we think, can read this unpretending volume
without being interested&mdash;we might say fascinated&mdash;by
its manifold excellencies, or lay it
down without a high estimate of its author's
ministerial power. The people who listen to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
such a preacher are rarely privileged. The
volume is one of the few that, without qualification
or reserve, we can heartily commend.
Mr. Mackennal has a rare faculty for eliciting
the latent meanings of things without obtruding
the sense of his ingenuity, or failing in broad,
practical evangelical applications.&mdash;<i>The Wisdom
of the King, or Studies in Ecclesiastes.</i>
By the Rev. <span class="smcap">James Bennet</span>, St. John's, New
Brunswick. (Edinburgh: William Oliphant.)
Mr. Bennet writes with much intelligence and
good sense. In a plain, practical way he shapes
the lessons to be derived from Ecclesiastes
into a series of week-day lectures, and his book
may be commended as worthy to take its place
in the homiletical literature of Ecclesiastes.
Mr. Bennet still adheres to the almost exploded
notion that it is the veritable religious autobiography
of Solomon.&mdash;<i>Things Above.</i> By the
late <span class="smcap">F. W. French</span>, Rector of Newtown, near
Kells, County Meath. (James Nisbet and Co.)
Mr. French was, as the preface tells us, an aged
minister, who had entered upon his eighth decade,
and who died before this little book was
finished. It is a series of short chapters or
lectures concerning things above&mdash;their reality,
locality, character, &amp;c.&mdash;written with devout
feeling, and largely illustrated by quotations
from a considerable range of writers.&mdash;<i>Sermons
and Lectures.</i> By the late <span class="smcap">William M'Combie</span>.
(Edinburgh: T. and T. Clark.) Mr. M'Combie
was the editor of the <i>Aberdeen Free Press</i>, and
a layman. He was accustomed to preach,
chiefly in the Baptist Church, of which he was
a member; and these discourses were prepared,
not for publication, but for preaching. Mr.
M'Combie was one of the most able men in the
North of Scotland. He had much in common
with Hugh Miller. His intellectual independence,
vigorous thinking, manifold attainments,
and cultured beauty and precision of expression,
were not surpassed by any of his compeers.
His 'Hours of Thought,' and still
more, his 'Moral Agency,' proved, in their revolt
from Predestinarianism, as commonly taught by
Scotch Calvinism, both his profound metaphysical
thinking and his intellectual independence.
These sermons have not the finish of his own
published works, but they are full of rare
thoughtfulness and wisdom, and of rich spiritual
feeling and suggestiveness. Their strong, unwavering
faith in the sufficiency and power of
the religion of Jesus to satisfy every necessity
of the individual and social life of men is a fine
tonic in these degenerate days. It is something
to hear a man who believes as Mr. M'Combie
believes speak as he speaks.&mdash;<i>Sermons for the
Times, preached at the Independent Chapel,
Newbury.</i> By <span class="smcap">E. W. Shalders</span>, B.A. (Blacket
and Son, Newbury.) Mr. Shalders has done
most excellent service to the cause of spiritual
Christianity by the issue of this series of discourses
on the questions at issue between the
Ritualist and the Free Churchman. The topics
chosen by our author have been 'Baptismal
Regeneration,' 'Apostolic Succession,' 'The
Childishness of Ritualism,' 'Exclusiveness the
real Schism.' Scholarship, candour, strength,
clearness, and fine manly tone, pervade each of
these discussions. We should be glad to see
them circulated by tens of thousands.&mdash;<i>The
Revision of the New Testament, being a Popular
Exposition of its Needs and Limits; a
Lecture delivered before the Norwich Young
Men's Christian Association.</i> By <span class="smcap">George S.
Barrett</span>, B.A. (Hodder and Stoughton.) This
lecture is admirably well done. There is a refined
tone in the discussion, and a thorough
grasp of the whole subject. When he was
about it, however, Mr. Barrett might as well
have explained a little more fully what is meant
by 'The Text of Scripture.' The class addressed
by the lecturer are singularly hazy on
this point. It is not uncommon to meet with
pious folk who, when the rejection, <i>e.g.</i>, of 1
John v. 7, is made to depend on its absence
from all Greek MSS., are ready to exclaim&mdash;'So
much the worse for the MSS!' We
heartily thank Mr. Barrett for his timely publication.&mdash;<i>The
Plymouth Pulpit.</i> Sermons by
<span class="smcap">Henry Ward Beecher</span>. Third Series. (Dickenson.)
The third series of Mr. Beecher's
sermons fully sustains the interest excited by
the previous volumes. There are the same
high passion and earnest, practical love, the
same brilliant touch, the ring of the same musical
metal which have charmed and instructed
us so often. This volume is characterized by
more frequent treatment of great doctrinal
themes, when liberal views are guarded by
conservative love. There is a most powerful,
practical, and useful discourse on the fearful
theme of 'The Sin against the Holy Ghost.'</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_25" id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> In thus provisionally identifying Zion with
a hill north of the temple, it may be well to call
attention to Josephus's description of the eastern
hill. He says it was <span class="greek" title="amphikurtos">&#7936;&#956;&#966;&#943;&#954;&#965;&#961;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>, a word which
is sometimes translated 'gibbous' sometimes
'sloping on both sides,' and sometimes 'the
shape of a moon when horned.' Liddell and
Scott say '<i>curved on each side</i>, like the moon in
its third quarter, <i>gibbous</i>;' but as <span class="greek" title="kurtos">&#954;&#973;&#961;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span> by itself,
is simply 'curved or arched,' and each side of
the moon is carved as much when it is crescent
as when gibbous, we have rendered the term
'crescent-shaped,' being influenced by the fact
that the Tyrop&oelig;on valley and that from Herod's
gate would really give a crescent shape to the
two eastern hills which in his day were one.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_26" id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> It seems to us overlooked, that before the
Akra was cut down it may have been higher
than the western hill. If so, it would be the upper
city in David's time, and Josephus's statement
that David look the lower city and the
Akra would have new light thrown upon it. It
would then be clear that Akra was co-extensive
with the city of David, which is Zion, and the
absence of all mention of the upper city at this
siege would be explained.</p>

cannot help talking here about <i>France</i> and

be noticed that the <i>Francia</i> of this writer, while
it excludes Germany, equally excludes Burgundy

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_58" id="Footnote_58" href="#FNanchor_58"><span class="label">[58]</span></a> Ann. Prud. Trec. 845. 'Nordmannorum

hinc et abinde cuncta vastantes, Loticiam
Parisiorum nullo penitus obsistente pervadunt.
Quibus quum Carolus occurrere moliretur, sed
pr&aelig;valere suos nullatenus posse prospiceret, quibusdam
pactionibus, et munere septem milium librarum
eis exhibito, a progrediendo compescuit,
ac redire persuasit.' So in the Annals of Fulda,
845 (Pertz. i. 364): 'Nordmanni regnum Karoli
vastantes, per Sequanam usque Parisios navigio
venerunt, et tam ab ipso quam incolis terr&aelig; accept&acirc;

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_59" id="Footnote_59" href="#FNanchor_59"><span class="label">[59]</span></a> Ann. Prud. Trec. 857: 'Dani Sequan&aelig; insistentes

sanct&aelig; Genovef&aelig; incendunt et ceteras omnes,
pr&aelig;ter domum sancti Stephani et ecclesiam
sancti Vincentii atque Germani pr&aelig;terque ecclesiam
sancti Dionysii, pro quibus tantummodo,
ne incenderentur, multa solidorum summa soluta
est.' Sir Francis Palgrave (i. 439,464) gives
a vivid picture of this sack of Paris. Of Saint
Denis he adds: 'Saint Denis made a bad bargain.
The Northmen did not hold to their contract,
or another company of pirates did not
consider it as binding: the Monastery was
burnt to a shell, and a most heavy ransom
paid for the liberation of Abbot Lewis, Charlemagne's
grandson, by his daughter Rothaida.'
Sir Francis, as usual, gives no reference; but we
may be sure that he could, if he had pleased,
have given one for the burning of the Monastery
as well as for the capture of the Abbot, which
the Annals mention under the next year, though
not in connection with the sack of Paris.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_60" id="Footnote_60" href="#FNanchor_60"><span class="label">[60]</span></a> Sir Francis Palgrave, i. 462, says: 'Amongst
the calamities of the times, the destruction of the
Parisian monasteries seems to have worked
peculiarly on the imagination. Paschasius Radbertus,
the biographer of Wala, expatiates upon
this misery when writing his Commentary on
Jeremiah.' Some extracts are given in Pertz, i.
450: 'Quis umquam crederet, vel quis umquam
cogitare potuisset ... ut pirat&aelig;, diversis
admodum collecti ex familiis, Parisiorum attingerent
fines, ecclesiasque Christi hinc inde cremarent
circa litus?... Fateor enim quod
nullus ex regibus terr&aelig; ista cogitaret, neque
ullus habitator orbis nostri audire potuisset quod
Parisium nostrum hostis intraret.'</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_61" id="Footnote_61" href="#FNanchor_61"><span class="label">[61]</span></a> It is worth notice, that Charles the Bald, as
well as his soldiers, could speak the 'lingua
Romana,' or Romance tongue. See the Capitularies
put forth by the Kings Lewis, Charles,
and Lothar at Coblentz in 860. Lewis speaks
'lingua Theothisca,' and Charles, 'lingua Romana,'
(Pertz, Leges, i. 472.) Yet Charles, in his
own Capitularies, speaks of 'lingua Theodisca'
as the language of the country, exactly as Lewis
does, (i, 482, 497.)</p>

ourselves at all largely of his researches in detail.
We can, however, refer to his clear investigations
of Robert's origin, and of the extent of his

widest sense. 'Franciam vero interdum quum
nominavero, omnes Cisalpinas provincias significo
... in illo tempore propter excellentiam
gloriosissimi Karoli et Galli, et Aquitani, &AElig;dui

These are Charles the Simple, and the second
Robert, afterwards King.</p>

Mourin's 'Comtes de Paris,' a book whose name

his youth, and, that of his brother Robert, the
Duchy was granted to Hugh the Abbot. Ann.
Met. 867. (See Kalckstein, p. 109.) Odo did
not succeed to the whole Duchy till the death of
Hugh in 887 in the middle of the siege, 'Ducatus
quem [Hugo] tenuerat et strenue rexerat Odoni

Imperial dignity is recorded is remarkable. After
a satirical description of the Imperial costume,
the Annal goes on, 'Omnem enim consuetudinem

optimas arbitrabatur, et ut majorem su&aelig; mentis
elationem ostenderet, ablato Regis nomine, se

mare consistentium appellare pr&aelig;cepit.' The
phrase 'cis mare' is remarkable, when we think
of the English claims to Empire, and of the constant
use of the word 'transmarinus' to express
England and English things. The common
name for diaries in these Annals is 'Galli&aelig;

the whole of Lent and up to the Rogation days in

then went home, having done nothing except
kill some Danes whom they found outside their

Consul furtivus viator, egreditur, non longe a
Parisiac&acirc; urbe burgum sancti Germani devitans,
a molendinario qui molendinos Secan&aelig; custodiebat,
dato ei suo habitu, navigium sibi parari impetravit.'</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_130" id="Footnote_130" href="#FNanchor_130"><span class="label">[130]</span></a> All that Richer (ii. 58,) tells us is that Otto's
troops, after crossing the river, 'terr&acirc; recepti incendiis
pr&aelig;disque vehementibus totam regionem
usque Ligerim depopulati sunt. Post h&aelig;c
feruntur in terram piratarum ac solo tenus devastant.
Sicque Regis injuriam atrociter ulti;
iter ad sua retorquent.' The 'terra piratarum'
is of course Normandy.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_131" id="Footnote_131" href="#FNanchor_131"><span class="label">[131]</span></a> Lothar was the son of Lewis and Gerberga,
the sister of Otto the Great; Lothar and the
younger Otto were therefore cousins.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_132" id="Footnote_132" href="#FNanchor_132"><span class="label">[132]</span></a> Richer iii. 71. '&AElig;ream aquilam qu&aelig; in
vertice palatii a Karolo Magno acsi volans fixa
erat, in vulturnum converterunt. Nam Germani
eam in favonium converterant, subtiliter signicantes
Gallos suo equitatu quandoque posse
devinci.' So Thietmar of Merseburg, iii. 6 (Pertz.
iii. 761), records the turning of the eagle and
adds, 'H&aelig;c stat in orientali parte dom&ucirc;s, morisque
fuit omnium hunc locum possidentium, ad
sua eam vertere regna.' The raid on Aachen is
also described by Baldric in the Gesta Episcoporum
Cameracensium i. 96 (Pertz. vii. 440). He
always speaks of Lothar as 'Rex Karlensium,'
and of his kingdom as 'partes Karlensium.' In
Thietmar he is 'Rex Karolingorum.'</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_136" id="Footnote_136" href="#FNanchor_136"><span class="label">[136]</span></a> This story comes from Baldric, Gest. Ep,

scarcely say, Montmartre.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_137" id="Footnote_137" href="#FNanchor_137"><span class="label">[137]</span></a> Gest. Cons. Andeg. vi. 2. Very little can be
made of a story in which the invasion of Otto is
placed in the reign of Robert, the son of Hugh
Capet, who is represented as King, his father
being still only Duke. The expedition of Otto
is thus described. 'Otto siquidem Rex Alemannorum
cum universis copiis suis Saxonum et
<i>Danorum</i> Montem Morentiaci obsederat, et urbi
Parisius multos assultus ignominiose faciebat.'
Geoffrey Grisegonelle comes to the rescue with
three thousand men.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_140" id="Footnote_140" href="#FNanchor_140"><span class="label">[140]</span></a> Rudolf Glaber i. 3. His way of telling the
whole story should be noticed. 'Lotharius ...
ut erat agilis corpore, et validus, sensuque integer,
tentavit redintegrare regnum, ut olim
fuerat.' This is explained in the next sentence.
'Nam partem ipsius regni superiorem, qu&aelig; etiam
Lotharii Regnum cognominatur, Otto Rex Saxonum,
immo Imperator Romanorum, [this means
Otto the Great, "primus ac maximus Otto"] ad
suum, id est Saxonum, inclinaverat regnum.'
The retreat is thus described. 'Lotharius ex
omni Franci&acirc; atque Burgundi&acirc; militari manu in
unum coact&acirc;, persecutus est Ottonis exercitum
usque in fluvium Mosam, multosque ex ipsis
fugientibus in eodem flumine contigit interire.'</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_141" id="Footnote_141" href="#FNanchor_141"><span class="label">[141]</span></a> Richer iii. 77. 'Axon&aelig; fluvii vada festinantes

affuit. Qui reperti fuere mox gladiis

the 'Catholic' view relative to the use of capitals,
what special sanctity is supposed to reside in
them, and what rule governs their employment.
They form a marked feature in 'Catholic' literature,
and certainly sometimes puzzle us. Why,
for example, should 'Party' have a capital here?</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_211" id="Footnote_211" href="#FNanchor_211"><span class="label">[211]</span></a> The ex-Emperor's selfishness is proved by
his never having tried to introduce anything answering
to our Poor Law, with the working of
which he must have been thoroughly acquainted.
Our system is far from perfect; but it saves us
from those terrible food revolutions, one of which
has so lately made Paris such a pitiable sight.
Louis Napoleon preferred the French voluntary
system, because he always hoped to get the <i>ouvriers</i>
in hand (as he had got the peasants), and to
use them, too, against any rising of the more intelligent
classes.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_212" id="Footnote_212" href="#FNanchor_212"><span class="label">[212]</span></a> Benjamin Constant is a notable instance of
the want of staunchness of too many French
writers. At first strongly against the Empire,
he was won over by the uncle far more easily
than poor Pr&eacute;vost-Paradol was by the nephew.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_213" id="Footnote_213" href="#FNanchor_213"><span class="label">[213]</span></a> Witness the cruel exactions, at Compi&egrave;gne
(<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, 11th March) and elsewhere,

peace.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_214" id="Footnote_214" href="#FNanchor_214"><span class="label">[214]</span></a> The hatred is reciprocated. Germany does
not forget French occupation. An eminent German
remarked to us the other day that more
than a dozen Prussian towns are still paying the
interest of the money borrowed to pay the first
Napoleon's exactions. He remarked, too, on the
cruelties which the French practised; and said
that Germany remembers Davoust at Hamburg,
and his turning out 26,000 people on New Year's-day
to perish in the cold, because they could not
show that they had a sufficient stock of siege provisions.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_215" id="Footnote_215" href="#FNanchor_215"><span class="label">[215]</span></a> Yet the clergy, as might be predicted from
the fulsomeness of their homage, only flattered
Napoleon for their own ends. They soon showed
their ingratitude. Pradt, Archbishop of Mechlin,
invented the epithet, <i>Jupiter-Scapin</i>. Talleyrand
did his best to pull down the falling Empire.
The peasantry whom they had taught were
less fickle.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_216" id="Footnote_216" href="#FNanchor_216"><span class="label">[216]</span></a> A curiosity in the history of Catechisms is
that in use in Spain while Napoleon was extolled
as God's image on earth in the neighbouring
country. Therein young Spaniards were taught
as follows: 'Tell me, my child, who are you?'&mdash;'A
Spaniard, by the grace of God.' 'Who is
the enemy of our happiness?'&mdash;'The Emperor
of the French.' 'How many natures hath he?'&mdash;'Two;
the human and the diabolical.'&mdash;Mignet,

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_218" id="Footnote_218" href="#FNanchor_218"><span class="label">[218]</span></a> Of the sad civil war in the capital we would
only say that it is partly due to the want of a
proper Poor Law, partly to the justly bitter
feeling caused by the hard terms of peace&mdash;terms
so different from those of 1815, which secured
fifty years' peace, and eventually made France
and England friends.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_219" id="Footnote_219" href="#FNanchor_219"><span class="label">[219]</span></a> It is needless to enumerate the number of
English essays and books upon Berkeley and his
philosophy which have recently appeared. It
may not be so well known to our readers that
Berkeley's doctrines are at present very widely
discussed in Germany. A great deal of this discussion
is doubtless due to the exertions of that
fervid Berkeleian, Dr. T. Collyns Simon, who, according
to a German critic, 'reist in Deutschland
umher, um mit allen Mitteln des Worts und der
Schrift, propaganda f&uuml;r seinen Meister zu machen;'
but the interest shown on the subject must
rest on a deeper basis. Of German dissertations
on Berkeley we have seen the following:&mdash;R.
Hoppe in <i>Bergman's Zeitschrift</i>, v. Heft. 2. 1870;
Freiherr v. Reichlin-Meldegg, in <i>Fichte's Zeitschrift</i>,
lvi. Heft. 2, 1870; T. Collyns Simon and
H. Ulrici, in <i>Fichte's Zeitschrift</i>, lvii. Heft. 1; and
F. Friederich's <i>Ueber Berkeley's Idealismus</i>, 1870.
To these must be added, as the most important
of all, Prof. F. Ueberweg's translation of Berkeley's
'Principles of Human Knowledge,' with a
short preface and some very valuable notes, published
in Heimann's cheap series of philosophical
works, Berlin, 1869. The growing interest felt
in Berkeley is also to be seen in the larger amount
of space given to the criticism of his doctrines in
the more recent work on the history of philosophy,
such as Freiherr v. Reichlin-Meldegg's <i>Einleitung
zur Philosophie</i>, Wien, 1870.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_220" id="Footnote_220" href="#FNanchor_220"><span class="label">[220]</span></a> We use the word 'Idealist' in the modern
German sense. It is the technical term to denote
that tendency in human speculation which is
embodied in Plato's Dialectic, Schelling's Natur-Philosophie,
Hegel's metaphysical logic, or Ferrier's
scorn for Psychology, and is opposed
to 'Realist,' which is applied to Herbart's Metaphysic,
Mill's Ethics, or Buckle's History of
Civilization; cf. Dr. F. Ueberweg on 'Idealism,
Realism, and Ideal-Realism,' in Fichte's <i>Zeitschrift</i>,
vol. 34.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_221" id="Footnote_221" href="#FNanchor_221"><span class="label">[221]</span></a> The writer of an article on the Idealism of
Berkeley and Collier, in the <i>North British Review</i>,
January, 1871, summarizes forcibly the arguments
against Berkeley which have been
urged by the so-called school of Natural Realists.
It is evidently an attempt to show that the theories
of Berkeley and Collier are incompatible
with the doctrine of the Incarnation, and therefore,
the writer thinks, with that of Transubstantiation
also.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_222" id="Footnote_222" href="#FNanchor_222"><span class="label">[222]</span></a> Professor Hermann Ulrici, of Halle, in
Fichte's <i>Zeitschrift</i>, vol. lvii. Pt. 1, 1870, pp.
171-4.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_223" id="Footnote_223" href="#FNanchor_223"><span class="label">[223]</span></a> As Freiherr v. Reichlin-Meldegg does, <i>Enleit.
f&uuml;r Philosophie</i>, p. 122.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_224" id="Footnote_224" href="#FNanchor_224"><span class="label">[224]</span></a> The advance which Berkeley made from the
stand-point of Locke may not have been made
very clear by this abstract statement; but the
difference of conception was just the difference
between the Baconian and modern induction.
Bacon endeavoured to explain everything by referring
it to its <i>form</i>; and this form was a contemporaneous
cause, corresponding very much
to the abstract ideas of Locke, or rather to
those abstract ideas which are supposed to
be the more important, viz., the primary qualities
(cf. Ellis and Spedding's Ed. of Bacon, I., p.
29). Modern induction explains by referring a
consequent to its invariable antecedent. It introduces
the idea of motion, succession, or flow,
and explains a thing by showing its place in the
flow of phenomena. It is interesting to note
that while Berkeley was thus substituting a living
causality for the abstract ideas of Locke,
and explaining the construction and objective
knowledge of things by their position in the successive
moments of a personal agency, other
philosophers were endeavouring to solve the
same metaphysical and psychological problem
in somewhat the same way. Leibnitz's 'Monadologie'
was really an attempt to explain the
existence of universals and objective principles
of knowledge by the thought of growth or
development or flow; but Leibnitz's explanation
differs from Berkeley's in this, that he kept chiefly
the thought of the development itself before
his mind, and conceived a gradual progression
through impersonal existences up to the conscious
self, while Berkeley, keeping to his direct
spiritual intuition, ever looks at this flow as
manifesting the presence and action of a free
personal spirit. The same general thought is
also at the basis of Wolff's hint that the <i>causal-nexus</i>,
not abstract ideas, enables us to explain
how universal judgments are formed out of individual
experiences (<i>logica</i>, &sect; 706). It has developed
since then into the conception of <i>organic
development</i>, which plays such an important
part in Kant's 'Kritik der Urtheilskraft,' is the
fundamental thought in such post Kantian
metaphysics as the 'Natur-Philosophie' of
Schelling, and the 'Mikrokosmos' of Herman
Lotze, and may be called the metaphysical foundation
for the scientific method which has led
to the theories of Darwin in natural history, of
Aug. Schleicher in philology, and of the Leyden
School in the history of religions.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_225" id="Footnote_225" href="#FNanchor_225"><span class="label">[225]</span></a> In proof of this, we need only refer to the
admirable preface of Professor Fraser, especially
pp. 3, 5, 7, 9.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_226" id="Footnote_226" href="#FNanchor_226"><span class="label">[226]</span></a> Berkeley is usually esteemed the foremost of
modern Nominalists, but we question if his
Nominalism was more than a denial of Conceptualism.
It was not a positive doctrine. There
are several assertions in his 'Common-place
Book' which show that even in his earlier days
he was not a Nominalist in the proper sense of
the term. He denies once and again Locke's
statement that we know particulars only; he
believes in the real existence of classes or kinds;
and he says that genera and species are not abstractions.
In his later writings he probably
found that in his eagerness to attack the conceptualist
doctrine of abstract conceptions, he had
probably been carried too far, for in his third
edition of 'Alciphron' he curiously omits those
chapters which treat of Nominalism, and in
'Siris' the reality of universals is assumed
throughout.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_230" id="Footnote_230" href="#FNanchor_230"><span class="label">[230]</span></a> There is undoubtedly one difficulty to this
hypothesis, and that difficulty arises from Berkeley's
mathematical opinions; for the whole question
between Berkeley and Newton in the
'Analyst' may be resolved to this one particular,&mdash;in
Berkeley's view a line is a series of points,
in Newton's the line is not the series of separate
points, but these points coalescing and arranging
themselves in length. Newton says, 'Line&aelig;
describuntur ac describendo generantur non per
appositiones partium sed per motum continuum
punctorum.' The difference between them was
just the difference between Nominalism and
Realism, and Berkeley takes the Nominalist side.
This may have been due to his ignorance of mathematics.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
